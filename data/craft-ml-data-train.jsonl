The beverage giant has said that donations from its associates to non-profit partners will be matched by the PepsiCo Foundation\n\nIKEA - the Swedish retailer has committed \u20ac10m to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 emergency fund in Turkey and Syria, with CEO of the Ikea Foundation Per Heggenes calling on \"the world\u2019s governments, businesses, and philanthropies to join us in the relief support for T\u00fcrkiye and northern Syria\". \n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nStarbucks \u2013 reflecting its strong links with the local community, operating more 600 stores throughout Turkey, Starbucks is working closely with its licensee and local leadership to ensure its partners and their families are cared for.

{"text":"More than 10 million holiday packages did not reach their destinations on Friday nor will they reach their destinations by Christmas Eve, casualties of the weather nightmare ensnaring more than half of the country, consultancy ShipMatrix Inc. said Saturday.\n\nThe bad weather, which has caused delays at parcel carriers\u2019 East Coast and Midwest air and ground hubs, and has made driving slow and treacherous across the nation\u2019s roads and highways, means that about 15% of deliveries scheduled for Friday and Saturday will not have made it by Christmas Day, said the consultancy, which has tracked the delivery carriers\u2019 annual peak-season performance for many years.\n\nThe delays have caused shipment backlogs that may not clear until the middle of next week, ShipMatrix said. Currently, there are about 160 million packages in the nation\u2019s delivery pipeline, according to ShipMatrix data.\n\nTypically, each local driver delivers 250 to 300 packages per day at this time in the peak cycle, ShipMatrix said. However, hazardous road conditions are limiting daily deliveries to about 150 parcels per driver, the firm said.\n\nThe bad weather has even caused delays for the 20% of parcels moving via air in premium-priced express services, Jindel said.\n\nUntil the widespread cold snap of the past 2 to 3 days, the delivery carriers were holding their own in on-time delivery performance. From Dec. 8 to Dec. 17, UPS Inc.\u2019s (NYSE: UPS) on-time delivery rate stood at 97.9%, FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) stood at 96.8% and the U.S. Postal Service clocked in at 94.4%, according to ShipMatrix data.\n\n\n\nIt has been nine years since inclement weather played a part in triggering significant delivery delays during Christmas Week. In 2013, millions of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) parcels did not arrive on time, courtesy not only of the elements but of Amazon flooding UPS with millions of last-minute deliveries that UPS was not prepared for.

{"text":"Easing supply-chain pressures haven\u2019t come fast enough to pull the maker of the popular Instant Pot cooker and Pyrex glassware out of a financial tailspin brought on by pandemic-driven turmoil. \n\nInstant Brands filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month with its balance sheet crumpled by the high costs of keeping its supply chain running even as demand for its products, standbys in many American kitchens, soared and then slumped in rapidly changing consumer markets. \n\nThe company is seeking to restructure debt that includes tens of millions of dollars owed to manufacturers in China and some $320,000 to various unnamed logistics providers, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. It lists United Parcel Service, to which it owes $802,274, and Packaging Corp. of America, at $765,167, among its top 30 unsecured creditors. \n\nThe company said in its filing that it faced \u201cunprecedented liquidity challenges, which have accelerated dramatically over the past months driven by severely tightened credit terms with suppliers, rising interest rates, continued inflation and a shifting in Instant Brands\u2019 historical distribution channels in North America, while supply chain issues persisted.\u201d\n\nThe Logistics Report\n\nTop news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.\n\nSupply-chain experts said Instant Brands\u2019 woes show how many retailers and manufacturers, particularly smaller operators without big capital cushions, are still coping with the financial overhang of the turmoil during the pandemic. International shipping costs, for instance, surged some 10-fold in 2021 from prepandemic levels and have only receded this year. \n\nRetailers have a lot of inventory that they purchased and imported at high rates and have shipping contracts negotiated during a period of high prices, \u201cso that now maybe some of the cost increases are starting to come through,\u201d said Lisa Ellram, a supply-chain management professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nThe Downers Grove, Ill.-based company\u2019s Instant Pot became a hit early in the pandemic as locked-down Americans turned to the all-in-one kitchen gadget to cook more meals at home. \n\nBut consumer demand shifted just as port closures, shipping backlogs and soaring freight costs tangled the company\u2019s supply chain. As overstuffed freight transportation channels started to crack and delays spread, lead times for ordering everything from raw materials to finished goods lengthened. Instant Brands said in its filing that it ordered parts further in advance and raised its prices to help offset those costs, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2021, a supply chain perfect storm unfolded,\u201d the company said in its bankruptcy filing. \n\nInstant Brands faced more challenges last year as retailers, overstocked with items consumers no longer wanted, slashed orders. The company cut its own production orders, raised prices and trimmed operating costs at least four times over the past three years, but still faced \u201csignificant pressure\u201d on its balance sheet, according to court filings. \n\n\nPyrex is one of Instant Brands well-known kitchen supplies. PHOTO: RICHARD B. LEVINE\/ZUMA PRESS\nMarko Bastl, director of Marquette University\u2019s Center for Supply Chain Management, said many of the companies that made goods in anticipation of strong consumer demand today are coping with higher inventory carrying costs since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates early last year. \n\n\u201cRetailers will stockpile finished product, and distributors for example and manufacturers will stockpile their input materials, and many of them are really, really hurting now that we are coming slowly out of the pandemic and demand has shifted again,\u201d Bastl said. \u201cGiven the increased interest rates and so on, their balance sheets are badly hurt.\u201d\n\nInstant Brands said in its bankruptcy court filing that it owes sourced finished goods vendors about $41.3 million, specialty material vendors about $8.4 million, and foreign vendors\u2014including its Chinese manufacturers\u2014about $45.3 million.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"No one wants a hurricane to make landfall. Among nature\u2019s most damaging events, hurricanes that hit land in the United States usually cause death, destruction and misery. They can also cause havoc to supply chains. \n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina was a 100,000-truckload event, requiring one of the largest relief and recovery supply deployments in U.S. history. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey prompted one of the greatest truck capacity crunches in recent history. \n\nHurricane Lee could cause massive supply chain disruptions if it lands in the United States\nHurricane Lee, which strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane on Wednesday, will likely become a major hurricane by Friday and a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150 mph by Saturday.\n\nLee is now in the Atlantic Ocean well east of any land. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects Lee to intensify quickly and become an extremely dangerous major hurricane. At this time, it is too early to know if Lee will hit any of the major Caribbean islands or the United States.\n\nHowever, if Lee \u2014 or any major hurricane \u2014 did make landfall near a major city, it could cause massive capacity disruptions for U.S. shippers just prior to the peak season run-up.\n\nIf a major hurricane is forecast to make landfall, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state-level agencies will soak up every available truck in the market for relief activities. \n\n\n\nShippers will face much higher freight rates. Shippers would be wise to lock in secure commitments (even at higher contract rates) for a potentially chaotic fourth quarter. At worst, they may be left without trucks to haul goods.\n\nHurricanes create massive demand surges. Rates that shippers locked in to carriers anticipating a slow second half may not work in a tight capacity environment. Many carriers will chase the higher-paying FEMA freight, often ditching shippers that they view as cheap or undesirable.\n\nFor shippers unsure about what to pay in the market, they could resort to high-frequency freight rate benchmarking tools, such as SONAR, or the implementation of index-linked contracts. \n\nImpact on infrastructure\nDepending on where a hurricane hits and its subsequent path over land, a variety of infrastructure can be impacted. Seaports in the path of a hurricane close and may take time to reopen, particularly if there is any damage. The same is true for airports, rail yards and track and certainly bridges and highways. \n\nSome hurricanes have done significant damage to key infrastructure, while others have done very little damage. \n\nRegardless, these storms usually impact key parts of a state\u2019s or region\u2019s infrastructure, if only in the sense of delays. Supply chains break down because of hurricanes; sometimes they are back up and running quickly, while at other times they can be subject to significant delays. \n\n\nHurricane relief efforts\nYears before founding FreightWaves, I ran Xpress Direct from 2002 to 2005. Xpress Direct was the on-demand emergency unit of U.S. Xpress. Over the course of four years dealing with hurricane activity, Xpress Direct handled in excess of 20,000 shipments and billed over $100 million in revenue in disaster-relief loads alone.\n\nHurricane-relief loads offer an opportunity for trucking companies to demonstrate to the public how critical trucking is, regardless of how challenging a mission might be. \n\nHurricane relief is the biggest dog-and-pony show you will ever see in trucking. But there is a certain satisfaction in being able to help people who are suffering.\n\nFreightWaves\u2019 ongoing coverage\nSince FreightWaves.com went online in 2017, it has covered the impact to the nation\u2019s transportation and supply chain of all the hurricanes that have hit the United States. \n\nFreightWaves will cover Hurricane Lee\u2019s path, preparations to deal with it and more \u2014 and will continue to do so through any major relief efforts. FreightWaves will do so for any and all natural disasters that strike the nation.\n\n\nSONAR users have access to our Critical Events Center, which provides real-time information on storm paths and impacts to supply chain infrastructure.","labels":["supplychain"]}

Among the compromised data were details of individuals receiving services from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement due to armed conflict, natural disasters, or migration.\n70 days after the breach, ICRC's third-party cybersecurity service detects a suspicious anomaly on ICRC servers containing sensitive data.\nA deep dive into the anomaly confirms the compromise of ICRC's server and the sensitive data contained therein on 9 November 2021.\nCompromised servers are taken offline.\n\u200d\n\nRed Cross security report\nSee how your organization's security posture compares to the ICRC's.\n\nView ICRC's security report.\n\n\u200d\n\nHow to Prevent an Incident lIke the Red Cross Data Breach\nA series of important lessons can be learned from the Red Cross data breach. Applying them to your cybersecurity program could help your organization avoid a similar fate.\n\n1. Commit to a Rigorous Security Patch Program\nICRC's vulnerability management processes failed to detect and address the exploit that led to this data breach - an oversight likely resulting from the difficulty of managing ICRC's complex, large-scale patching processes, which address tens of thousands of patches across multiple systems annually.\n\nUnfortunately, cybercriminals are not sympathetic to complex cybersecurity problems. They will take advantage of whatever exploit they discover - especially when their attacks are well-planned and targeted, which seems to be the case in this instance.\n\nRe-evaluate your current vulnerability patching routine to ensure it can rapidly address new critical vulnerabilities published on the  National Vulnerability Database (NVD).\n\n2. Follow a Regular Penetration Testing Schedule\nDespite having a multi-level cyber defense system in place comprising of endpoint monitoring and scanning software, ICRC was still breached. While it's fair to attribute the success of the attack to unusually sophisticated hacking techniques rather than the insufficiency of ICRC's cybersecurity program, this event highlights the importance of having backup processes for detecting security exploits should internal efforts fail.\n\nEstablish a regular penetration testing schedule for detecting network, system, and application vulnerabilities across your entire IT ecosystem. Pen testing methods should be commensurate to the complexity of cyberattacks likely to target your organization. High data breach risks industries, such as finance, healthcare, and technology, should assume they will be targeted by highly-complex cyber attackers.\n\nIf you prefer to manage pen testing internally rather than outsourcing to a third-party, here are some offensive security tools you should be aware of: \n\nMetasploit: An open-source framework for developing, testing, and executing exploits\nNessus: A vulnerability scanner that can identify and assess vulnerabilities in networks and systems\nMaltego: A tool for open-source intelligence and forensic analysis\nAircrack-ng: A suite of tools for wireless network cracking\nCain and Abel: A password cracking tool\nJohn the Ripper: A fast password-cracking tool\nSocial Engineer Toolkit (SET): A tool for performing social engineering attacks\nis your business at risk of a data breach?\n3. Implement Advanced Persistent Threat Controls.\nTo defend against APTs, it is important to implement a multi-layered security strategy that includes the following:\n\nNetwork segmentation: Segmenting your network into smaller subnets to obfuscate lateral movement and sensitive resource detection.\n\nLearn the top network segmentation best practices >\nRegular risk assessments: Identifying vulnerabilities in both your internal and third-party network to identify attack vectors facilitating potential malware injections \n\nLearn more about risk assessments >\nAdvanced threat detection solutions: Utilizing advanced threat detection and response solutions, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.\n\nSecurity awareness and education: Educating your employees about the risks of APTs and how to identify and report suspicious activity.\nRegular backups: Regularly backing up your data to expedite recovery if systems are compromised.\nRegular software updates and patching: Keeping all software and systems updated and patched to prevent exploitation through known vulnerabilities.\n\u200d\nImplementing an incident response plan: Having an incident response plan to ensure calculated response efforts following a breach.\n\nLearn how to create an Incident Response Plan >","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Shopify, the Canadian e-commerce giant that was once the country\u2019s most valuable company, is laying off roughly 1,000 employees as its explosive pandemic growth stalls.\n\n\nShares of Shopify sank roughly 16 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday in reaction to the news it will cut 10 per cent of its staff. By market close the company\u2019s stock price had recovered slightly to $40.69, a decline of 13.6 per cent on the day.\n\nCEO Tobi L\u00fctke said in a letter to employees made public Tuesday that the company made a bet that the global retail transition to e-commerce, which picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would continue to accelerate.\n\nThe Ottawa-based company, which backs digital storefronts and provides a variety of e-commerce services to its \u201cmillions\u201d of merchants, had scaled up its workforce to meet the demand it projected, L\u00fctke wrote.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, Shopify said it had more than 5,000 employees; as of Tuesday it said it has more than 10,000 without accounting for the layoffs. That means the company effectively doubled its headcount over the course of the pandemic.\n\nShopify was the country\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company for much of the COVID-19 pandemic. It took the crown from Royal Bank of Canada on May 6, 2020, and slipped from the top spot briefly in March 2021 before RBC reclaimed the title in January of this year as tech stocks took a beating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now clear that bet didn\u2019t pay off,\u201d said L\u00fctke, taking the blame.\n\n\u201cNow, we have to adjust. As a consequence, we have to say goodbye to some of you today and I\u2019m deeply sorry for that,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of the layoffs are in recruiting, support and sales jobs, L\u00fctke wrote, as well as eliminating over-specialized and duplicate roles.\n\n\u201cPut bluntly, this was a huge strategic mistake that was driven by an insufficient understanding of customer behaviour, a lack of rigour in analyzing the market, and a bit of hubris,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts Colin Sebastian and Rhys Ivory-Ganja of Baird Equity Research wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that the layoffs are a \u201cneeded course correction\u201d for Shopify, which they note was still gearing up for \u201caggressive\u201d hiring plans as recently as March.\n\n\u201cWith many investors very concerned about the original level of planned spending this year, the silver lining from the bad news today is that Shopify management should now be more focused on operating efficiency,\u201d Sebastian and Ivory-Ganja wrote.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"The pharmaceutical giant wouldn't be borrowing if it didn't have plans for how to make a tidy return.\nOn May 16, Pfizer (PFE -0.46%) announced that it was going to take out $31 billion in fresh debt to pay for its purchase of Seagen (SGEN 0.51%), an oncology drug developer. In total, it'll pay $43 billion for the company in a transaction that's set to reshape its future, and power shareholder returns for the remainder of the 2020s and perhaps beyond.\n\nSomewhat counterintuitively, investors should interpret this debt issuance as good news for Pfizer's stock. Here's why.\n\nTwo investors talk at a desk while drinking coffee and reviewing a stock chart on a laptop.\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\n\nThe benefits to Pfizer could be huge\nThe point of buying Seagen is that the company's 31 drugs in development could yield as much as $10 billion in annual revenue for Pfizer by 2030. They'll nearly double the size of Pfizer's oncology portfolio, which could position the company to be a global leader in cancer therapeutics for years to come. And when the transaction closes in late 2023 or early 2024, Seagen will also contribute its top line of approximately $2 billion to Pfizer's, though it isn't making a profit.\n\n\nCollapse\n\nNYSE: PFE\nPfizer\nToday's Change\n(-0.46%) -$0.17\nCurrent Price\n$36.84\nYTD\n1W\n1M\n3M\n6M\n1Y\n5Y\nPRICE\nVS S&P\n PFE\n S&P\nKEY DATA POINTS\nMarket Cap\n$208B\nDay's Range\n$36.55 - $37.15\n52wk Range\n$34.66 - $54.93\nVolume\n18,536,903\nAvg Vol\n26,049,092\nGross Margin\n63.40%\nDividend Yield\n4.43%\nGrabbing Seagen is one of the pillars of management's plan to add $45 billion in fresh annual revenue before the end of the decade, to reach a total of around $84 billion annually. It will help offset the anticipated loss of around $17 billion in sales from expiring exclusivity licenses for its medicines, and stem some of the losses from its rapidly eroding coronavirus drugs.\n\nTaking out more debt does involve paying some interest expenses, and it won't push the company to top 2022's more than $100 billion in sales anytime soon. But it's also a sign that management is willing to make big and bold bets for the sake of stoking growth.\n\n\nDon't worry about this company running up the tab\nWhile the potential advantages of the purchase are likely to be significant, Pfizer shareholders are correct to question the wisdom of taking out gargantuan tranches of new debt. After all, there's always a risk that Seagen's much-vaunted pipeline fails to yield enough new medicines to justify the costs of the investment and interest fees. But a closer inspection of Pfizer's balance sheet and cash flow statement can put these concerns to rest.\n\n\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: SGEN\nSeagen\nToday's Change\n(0.51%) $0.98\nCurrent Price\n$194.28\nYTD\n1W\n1M\n3M\n6M\n1Y\n5Y\nPRICE\nVS S&P\n SGEN\n S&P\nKEY DATA POINTS\nMarket Cap\n$36B\nDay's Range\n$193.25 - $194.75\n52wk Range\n$116.08 - $207.16\nVolume\n1,148,861\nAvg Vol\n1,049,754\nGross Margin\n76.46%\nDividend Yield\nN\/A\nRight now, Pfizer has about $20 billion in cash and equivalents, so it won't be using all of its liquid assets for the acquisition. As of the first quarter of 2023, it has $34.9 billion in long-term debt, so it'll have a total of roughly $65.9 billion after issuing the new debt.\n\nThat might sound like a scary amount until you consider that in 2022 free cash flow (FCF) was just over $26 billion. In 2019, even before Pfizer's massive windfall from sales of coronavirus products, it had FCF of nearly $10 billion. So as vaccine sales continue to erode due to falling demand, the company will still have plenty of money to service its debt.\n\nShareholders won't need to wait that long to see if the purchase is yielding fruit. Company leaders expect that between three and four years after the deal closes, the acquisition will start contributing to adjusted earnings per share (EPS). After paying down some of the debt it plans to rack up, Pfizer will focus on both reinvesting earnings into further growth and returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases. And management probably wouldn't bother to talk about a shift toward returning more capital if its plan was to slowly pay down the debt over the course of many years.\n\nShould you buy the stock?\nThe debt isn't a sign that Pfizer's stock is a smart investment for you specifically, even if it's good news for the company's future. The same goes for the Seagen purchase. In the near term, it's highly likely that declining need for Pfizer's coronavirus products will continue to be a headwind. You probably shouldn't expect this stock to grow as quickly as a smaller biopharma business.\n\nStill, if you're in the market for a safe-but-still-slated-to-grow company that pays a decent dividend -- currently yielding 4.5% -- it could be a good option. Just remember that you'll probably need to wait a few years before there's enough spare cash flow for Pfizer to start hiking its dividend faster, or buying shares back in larger volumes.","labels":["financial_success","investments"]}

It has a foothold across the globe and is now reaching countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis because of conflict, natural disasters and climate change.\n\nThe response plan will be implemented by UN agencies, with international NGOs and NGO consortia playing a direct role in the response. It will:\n\ndeliver essential laboratory equipment to test for the virus, and medical supplies to treat people;\ninstall handwashing stations in camps and settlements;\nlaunch public information campaigns on how to protect yourself and others from the virus; and\nestablish airbridges and hubs across Africa, Asia and Latin America to move humanitarian workers and supplies to where they are needed most.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said:\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is menacing the whole of humanity \u2013 and so the whole of humanity must fight back. Individual country responses are not going to be enough.\n\n\u201cWe must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable \u2013 millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves.  This is a matter of basic human solidarity. It is also crucial for combating the virus. This is the moment to step up for the vulnerable.\u201d\n\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said:\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has already upended life in some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries. It is now reaching places where people live in warzones, cannot easily access clean water and soap, and have no hope of a hospital bed if they fall critically ill.\n\n\u201cTo leave the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries to their fate would be both cruel and unwise. If we leave coronavirus to spread freely in these places, we would be placing millions at high risk, whole regions will be tipped into chaos and the virus will have the opportunity to circle back around the globe.  \n\n\u201cCountries battling the pandemic at home are rightly prioritizing people living in their own communities. But the hard truth is they will be failing to protect their own people if they do not act now to help the poorest countries protect themselves.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to help these countries prepare and continue helping the millions who rely on humanitarian assistance from the UN to survive. Properly funded, our global response effort will equip humanitarian organizations with the tools to fight the virus, save lives, and help contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.\u201d\n\nWHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:\n\n\u201cThe virus is now spreading in countries with weak health systems, including some which are already facing humanitarian crises. These countries need our support \u2013 out of solidarity but also to protect us all and help suppress this pandemic. At the same time, we must not fight the pandemic at the expense of the other humanitarian health emergencies.\u201d \n\nUNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said:\n\n\u201cChildren are the hidden victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and school closures are affecting their education, mental health and access to basic health services. The risks of exploitation and abuse are higher than ever, for boys and girls alike. For children on the move or living through conflicts, the consequences will be unlike any we have ever seen. We must not let them down.\u201d\n\nAt the virtual launch of the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, the UN Secretary-General was joined via video link by Mr. Lowcock, Dr Tedros and Ms. Fore.\n\nTogether they called on UN Member States to commit to stemming the impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable countries and containing the virus globally by giving the strongest possible support to the plan, while also sustaining core support to existing humanitarian appeals that help the more than 100 million people who already rely on humanitarian assistance from the UN just to survive.\n\nMember States were warned that any diversion of funding from existing humanitarian operations would create an environment in which cholera, measles and meningitis can thrive, in which even more children become malnourished, and in which extremists can take control \u2013 an environment that would be the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus.  \n\nTo kick-start the response plan, Mr. Lowcock released an additional $60 million from the UN\u2019s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). This brings CERF\u2019s support to humanitarian action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to $75 million. In addition, country-based pooled funds have allocated more than $3 million so far.\n\nThis new CERF allocation \u2013 one of the largest ever made \u2013 will support: WFP to ensure the continuity of supply chains and transport of aid workers and relief goods; WHO to contain the spread of the pandemic; and other agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to those most affected by the pandemic, including women and girls, refugees and internally displaced people. Support will include efforts around food security, physical and mental health, water and sanitation, nutrition and protection.\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"Uber must face a lawsuit filed by an UberEats driver back in 2019 as there\u2019s nothing in a unique California law that prevents the worker from pursuing his legal case, the California Supreme Court ruled on Monday.\n\nUberEats driver Erik Adolph did not give up his right under state law to sue on behalf of a large group of workers even though he signed an agreement to bring his own work-related legal claims in private arbitration, the court unanimously ruled, according to a Reuters report published on Yahoo! Finance.\n\nAdolph sued Uber in 2019, claiming the company misclassified UberEats drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. He claims these drivers must be reimbursed for work expenses under California law.\n\n\nIndependent contractors classification\nIn 2021, UberEats overhauled its business model and changed its contracts with delivery drivers amid growing pressure over the status of workers. The change would make it easier for the company to classify riders and drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees \u2013 an issue that has been challenged in court on several occasions.\n\nUnder the Private Attorney General Act, or PAGA, workers can sue for employment law violations on behalf of the state and keep one-quarter of any money they win. The rest goes to the state to fund an agency that enforces labor laws.\n\nNothing in that law prevents workers from pursuing claims on their own behalf in arbitration while separately litigating large-scale claims in court, the court said, according to the Reuters report published on Yahoo!

And the agreements typically bar them from filing or participating in traditional class action lawsuits, according to the report.\n\nIn 2020 however, the Fair Work Commission in Australia ruled that drivers who deliver food through online service UberEats are to be considered independent contractors \u2013 not employees of the company \u2013 owing to the flexibility of their work arrangement.\n\nPushback from employers\nMichael Rubin, who represents Adolph, said the ruling could spur companies to reconsider forcing workers' claims into arbitration if large-scale PAGA lawsuits can still proceed in court.\n\nWhile the decision may be considered a win for workers, employers expressed concerns about its possible repercussions, according to the Reuters report.\n\nThe ruling conflicts with the Viking River decision and violates a federal law that requires enforcing valid arbitration agreements, claimed Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for Uber.\n\n\"We are considering our appellate options,\" she said.\n\nA 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving Viking River Cruises said that companies could force individual PAGA claims into arbitration.\n\nSeveral groups \u2013 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2013 filed briefs in Monday's case, telling the California Supreme Court that a ruling against Uber could encourage workers to file meritless lawsuits and pressure companies to settle them.\n\nHowever, those concerns should be directed at state legislators, who have the power to change the law, the court said.\n\nIn February this year, Uber drivers across New Zealand initiated their first-ever collective bargaining agreement with the service- and ride-hailing giant in a bid to hike wages and improve working conditions.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"VAUGHAN, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bausch + Lomb Corporation (NYSE\/TSX: BLCO), a leading global eye health company dedicated to helping people see better to live better, today announced that Bausch + Lomb Escrow Corp. (\u201cEscrow Issuer\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, has launched an offering of $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior secured notes due 2028 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and that the company is seeking to enter into an incremental term loan facility, in each case in connection with the financing of its pending acquisition (\u201cAcquisition\u201d) of XIIDRA (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) 5%, a non-steroid eye drop specifically approved to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease focusing on inflammation associated with dry eye, and certain other ophthalmology assets.\n\nThe definitive documentation for the incremental term loan facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) may be in the form of either an incremental amendment to the company\u2019s existing credit agreement or a separate credit agreement. Bausch + Lomb is expected to borrow $500 million of new term B loans (\u201cNew Term B Loans\u201d) under the Term Loan Facility.\n\nThe net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, along with the expected proceeds from the New Term B Loans, are expected to fund the Acquisition, to pay fees and expenses related to the closing of the Acquisition, the offering of the Notes and the borrowings of the New Term B Loans and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt.\n\nIf the issuance of the Notes occurs prior to the closing of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be issued by the Escrow Issuer, and the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be deposited into a segregated escrow account. Upon closing of the Acquisition, Bausch + Lomb will assume the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the indenture that will govern the Notes and any other obligations of the Escrow Issuer and receive all of the assets of the Escrow Issuer, and the net proceeds will be released from the escrow account and applied as set forth above. However, if the issuance of the Notes occurs substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, Bausch + Lomb will be the issuer of the Notes and the escrow provision described above will not apply.\n\nFrom and after the closing of the Acquisition, the Notes will be guaranteed by each of the company\u2019s subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Term Loan Facility and the existing term loan facility and will be secured on a first-priority basis by liens on the assets that secure the Term Loan Facility and the existing term loan facility.\n\nClosing of the Term Loan Facility will be conditioned upon completion of the Acquisition and is anticipated to occur concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition at or around the end of September 2023. Closing of the Notes offering will not be conditioned upon completion of the Acquisition, but if the Acquisition does not occur on or prior to Sept. 30, 2024, or other specified events do not occur, the Escrow Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes at such time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nThe foregoing transactions are subject to market and other conditions. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully complete the transactions, on the terms described above, or at all.\n\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or any state securities law and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered in the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be qualified for sale to the public by prospectus under applicable Canadian securities laws and, accordingly, any offer and sale of the Notes in Canada will be made on a basis, which is exempt from the prospectus requirements of such securities laws.\n\nThis news release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\n\n###\n\nAbout Bausch + Lomb\n\nBausch + Lomb is dedicated to protecting and enhancing the gift of sight for millions of people around the world \u2013 from the moment of birth through every phase of life.

{"text":"As a historic drought continues to tighten the vise on the number and size of freight ships passing through the Panama Canal, many vessels are seeing increased dwell time and lead time to deliver their loads, the freight visibility provider project44 said Tuesday.\n\nWithout enough fresh water to operate its locks at standard pace, the canal recently added another 10 months to \u201cCondition 3\u201d restrictions that have squeezed capacity from 36 vessels per day transiting the canal to 32, and limited their draft underwater from the usual allowance of 50 feet to 44 feet.\n\nThose limits are causing notable backups. As of August 29, a total of 135 vessels were waiting for passage at both the Atlantic and Pacific entrances, significantly above the canal\u2019s goal to keep queues below 90 vessels, the canal said.\n\nHowever, despite those kinks, canal authorities say they have not seen a measurable reduction in the amount of cargo passing through the route. Just as it was in 2022, the canal remains the primary route for 57.5% of the total cargo transported in container ships from Asia to the eastern coast of the U.S., the canal says.\n\nOne reason that the delays haven\u2019t yet diverted ocean freight to other routes is that the effects aren't uniform across all carriers, Chicago-based project44 said. The canal typically gives priority to container ships over bulk carriers, and serves ships with appointments before those without. \n\nThe difference can be stark. Of the 135 vessels waiting in line, 53 have made reservations and will transit the Panama Canal without delay on their scheduled date. But the wait time for vessels lacking a booking appointment to pass through the canal has increased by 280% since June, going from an average of 2.5 days to approximately 9.5 days.\n\nThat means the best way to maintain smooth transits through the canal is to maintain effective communication between carriers and the port. \u201cShippers who proactively schedule appointments and maintain robust communication channels with the canal experience significantly fewer disruptions compared to those who infrequently use this route. The vessels that are most impacted by the new restrictions are non-booked, so shippers should be proactively booking vessels planned to pass through the canal,\u201d project44 said.\n\nBut as the \u201cCondition 3\u201d restrictions wear on, the penalty for lacking that communication could be increasingly severe. Many ships may begin to look for alternate shipping routes or lighten their loads to carry less weight and comply with draft limits, according to David Spencer, VP of Market Intelligence at Arrive Logistics. And those steps could have ripple effects throughout U.S. markets.\n\n\u201cIn general, ocean shipping delays tend to cause more of a funnel effect on import volumes, essentially throttling associated demand. Equipment shortages were a major headache as a side effect of COVID-19 related delays, which created a lot of interesting trends with cross docking, warehousing, and drayage. We would probably see some of those trends return as well as a result,\u201d Spencer said.","labels":["natural_disasters"]}
{"text":"The current Ebola outbreak is becoming more than just a worldwide emergency health issue. It is becoming a supply chain concern. While our thoughts are with those impacted by the awful disease, the potential supply chain risk is also creeping into the minds of business leaders.\n\nResilinc\u2019s monitoring shows some signs of a ripple effect on supply chain sourcing, pricing and availability of key raw materials. These events, indicated by an increasing number of news reports, raise flags about the impact the disease has on mining activities (particularly with alumina, iron ore and gold), palm oil and palm kernel oil supplies, and potential crude oil disruptions.\n\n\nProtecting Your Supply Chain\nTo avoid possible supply chain disruptions, companies can take a few steps now to secure their supply chains and mitigate risks associated with the contagion.\n\nHere are Resilinc\u2019s recommendations:\n\nImprove communication with partners. Actively engage suppliers in information-sharing notifications and, when possible, stay flexible when making sourcing, procurement and logistics decisions.\nMap and identify tier-one and sub-tier suppliers operating in and nearby countries affected by Ebola. Resilinc subscribers can use the \u201cWhat if\u201d tab in your dashboard for instant supply chain analytics. However, if you do not subscribe to Resilinc\u2019s service, here\u2019s some guidance:\nLocate where your raw materials are sourced and how these materials move across multiple tiers of suppliers globally\nAnalyze where and how key suppliers are likely to be impacted\nDetermine which products are at risk for a disruption and calculate the potential negative effect on your revenue and profits\nAnalyze current inventory levels for critical components, commodities and raw minerals. Understand which raw materials could most likely affect your production and delivery targets. Resilinc\u2019s supply chain analysis, for example, shows that one of the largest exports from Liberia, a country hard hit by the Ebola outbreak, is palm oil and palm kernel oil, a key building block in many raw materials. Luckily, 80 to 90 percent of these global supplies come from Malaysia and Indonesia, therefore the impact should be minimal. While global pricing is stable at this point, Resilinc is closely monitoring the situation. Below are materials that are downstream of palm oil and palm kernel oil.\nAscorbyl palmitate (antioxidant)\nCalcium stearate (tablet mold release agent and lubricant)\nCaprylic acid (treatment for some fungal and bacterial infections; surfactant, and cleaning agent)\nCetyl palmitate (emollient ingredient)\nIsopropyl myristate (solvent for topical therapeutics)\nSodium dodecyl sulfate (also known as SDS; surfactant)\nMagnesium stearate (tablet mold release agent and lubricant)\nMyristic acid (solvent for therapeutics)\nPalmitic acid (palmitoylation of proteins)\nPolysorbate 20 (surfactant and emulsifier)\nPolysorbate 80 (surfactant and emulsifier)\nSodium caprylate (treatment for some fungal infections; surfactant, and cleaning agent)\nSodium stearate (tablet mold release agent and lubricant)\nVitamin A palmitate (antioxidant)\nVitamin C ester (antioxidant)\nIn the midst of a crisis, knowledge brings peace of mind. Some manufacturers will spend hours and weeks monitoring and analyzing the potential impact Ebola could have on their supply chain. With Resilinc\u2019s pro-active supply chain mapping and monitoring, attaining that peace is just a click away.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}
{"text":"Key takeaways:\nHome Depot and Walmart reported earnings let down investors\nThe retail giants shared full-year guidance that disappointed investors since a spending slowing down is projected for the year\nOther retail stores are expected to see rough results as earnings continue to be reported\nWell-known retail giants Home Depot and Walmart delivered a grim outlook for the future of retail spending in 2023. Home Depot\u2019s stock fell after the report, while Walmart\u2019s stock essentially flatlined as investors digested what the news meant for the economy.\n\nWalmart and Home Depot sell two different types of goods to consumers, but their reports set a precedent for the upcoming week full of earnings from other retail companies. Here\u2019s what investors might be in for.\n\nIf you want to take the guesswork out of investing, consider downloading Q.ai to diversify your portfolio and minimize risk during these uncertain economic times.\n\nWalmart, the world's largest retailer, beat analyst expectations on earnings and sales estimates in its report released Tuesday morning. However, the company announced a lackluster outlook for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nWalmart's projection predicts adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.05, which came below estimates. Additionally, net sales are predicted to grow between 2.5% and 3%.\n\nOn a call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Rainey said, \"While the supply-chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high, and there is considerable pressure on the consumer.\" He added, \"Our guidance reflects a cautious outlook on the macro environment.\u201d\n\nInvesting Digest: Know what's moving the financial markets and what smart money is buying with Forbes Investing Digest.\n\nWalmart had good news as they reported an increase in customers who make more than $100,000. The company is ready for a shift in inventory if needed since demand may change.\n\nMost consumers who shop at Walmart Supercenters or Sam's Club do so for groceries, a recession-proof good. This will help the bottom line for the company with added foot traffic.\n\nHome Depot reported its earnings for Q4 2022 and missed Wall Street's revenue expectations for the first time since November 2019. Revenue slightly fell to $35.83 billion vs. $35.97 billion expected by analysts.\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company saw increased sales as consumers took on more home projects. Now, the company sees consumers spending their discretionary income on experiences outside the house. Moving forward, the company expects sales to be approximately flat for the new fiscal year.\n\nThe dip in the housing market also contributed to lower-than-expected results. As the company does not sell \"recession-proof goods,\" it will have difficulty increasing foot traffic among regular consumers. Home Depot management will need to watch closely and interpret sales data.\n\nFuture outlook for retail giants\nWalmart and Home Depot are well-known in their respective industries, and both provide unique services to consumers. Consequently, the outlook for the two will vary throughout the year.\n\nOn the one hand, it is possible that both companies are cautious as other businesses are planning for a down market. However, the grim side is consumer spending is slowing down in the country, which may lead to a deeper recession.\n\nReuters polled economists for their opinion about the future of sales, and the data showed they forecasted sales decreasing by 0.8%. This poll was done in January as retail sales plummeted 1.1% in December.\n\nSeveral banks have reported mixed future guidance for consumers, with some seeing no change in spending and others putting away cash for future defaulted loans.\n\nThe reality is that the retail industry is currently up against several obstacles, such as supply chain issues, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, tech job layoffs and low consumer confidence in the economy. Other retailers will likely see the same problems on a bigger scale, especially those involved in apparel goods.\n\nSlowing down of spending\nAccording to the New York Federal Reserve Bank, credit card balances in the U.S. hit a new all-time high of $986 billion. Americans continue to spend, but both Walmart and Home Depot expect spending to stay flat or decline. As prices continue to increase, it is unsurprising that spending would fall among discretionary income.\n\nWalmart is in an excellent position to take advantage of consumers looking for deals to save money as prices climb. At the same time, Home Depot has a strong loyalty following from current customers, whether for home renovations or contractors.\n\nAlthough Home Depot is confident that it will do well in the upcoming environment, it is less likely as consumers will spend less for goods. Chief Financial officer Richard McPhail stated on the earnings call, \u201cDuring COVID, we saw a shift into goods. Over the last really almost two years, we\u2019ve seen a gradual shift back away from goods into services, and we think our market has reflected that, and we think that that dynamic could put some pressure on our market.\u201d\n\nWhat it means for investors\nIt could be wise for investors to move forward with caution and stay liquid in this volatile market. Long-term investors should be able to weather the storm for the retail giants and may one day see a positive return.\n\nTasked with a more difficult job, short-term investors will need to rely on data and look for signs that signal more slowdowns in consumer spending. Focusing on retail trends will also be beneficial.\n\nNumerous obstacles face the retail industry, but demand remains relatively high as consumers want to make up for lost time from the pandemic lockdown. Experiences are receiving more dollars than goods, requiring companies to be more creative to improve their bottom lines.\n\nIf Home Depot and Walmart\u2019s projections have left you uncertain about the best ways to invest, Q.ai can help you by providing artificial intelligence-powered investment strategies. Plus, with the platform's Portfolio Protection, you can rest easy knowing your investments are safeguarded in this volatile market.\n\nThe bottom line\nLast quarter, retail shopping showed signs of a slowdown in spending. As more companies release their earnings reports, further insights will be provided into different types of goods that are being impacted.\n\nWhile this information will help determine the best investment opportunities for 2023, caution should always be used before investing during these uncertain economic times.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"The extent of damage from a tornado that struck a critical Pfizer factory in Rocky Mount, N.C., is now coming into focus.\n\nThe first images after the tornado hit it on July 19 showed a roof that was mangled and torn off. The facility makes dozens of medicines used in hospitals across the United States.\n\nHospitals panicked.\n\n\"Every hospital buyer across the country, the second they heard about that tornado, everyone was just, like, 'Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy!'\" says Erin Fox, a pharmacy director for the University of Utah Health's hospitals.\n\nThey didn't wait to find out which products were affected or how long shortages might last.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPfizer makes dozens of hospital drugs at the damaged factory\nPharmaceutical companies are reluctant to disclose exactly what they make where. The information is often blacked out on Food and Drug Administration inspection records, for example. The agency's statement following the tornado explained \"disclosure laws prevent the FDA from providing a complete list of products made at the facility.\"\n\nPfizer declined an interview request.\n\nNPR was able to use records from the National Institutes of Health to compile a list of dozens of drugs that are made there. They cover hundreds of billing codes that comprise different formulations and packages.\n\nThe products include a lot of painkillers and anesthetics that are used in hospitals and given intravenously. And there are also drugs like naloxone, which is used to reverse opioid overdoses, and vitamin K, which is used to prevent bleeding in newborns.\n\nAccording to Pfizer, this site makes about 8% of all sterile injectables used in hospitals across the U.S.\n\nPfizer makes many of these products only at its Rocky Mount site, NPR found. However, a competing company, like Baxter International, often makes a similar product.\n\nThe FDA says fewer than 10 products made by Pfizer at its Rocky Mount factory are sole source. But the agency said there are either substitutes or enough stock in other Pfizer warehouses to minimize disruptions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBoston University health economist Rena Conti says her research shows only a handful are \"backbone\" therapies for which there are no real alternatives. \"This includes vitamin K1, which is needed for almost every live birth in a hospital,\" she says, and aminophylline, which can help people who are having trouble breathing.\n\nThe FDA is working with Pfizer to assess and mitigate the situation, commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. The agency said it doesn't anticipate any immediate significant supply disruptions.\n\nPfizer limited hoarding\nThe company was able to curtail hoarding fairly quickly, University of Utah's Fox says. Pfizer worked with wholesalers to limit what hospitals could buy to no more than 100% of their usual orders.\n\nPfizer also sent a letter to health care providers on Friday, explaining that its initial assessment of the damage found that production areas of the Rocky Mount facility were mostly unscathed. The warehouse sustained most of the damage.\n\nThe company's letter listed 65 products made at the site that Pfizer thinks might have disruptions based on existing inventory and market share.\n\nA lot of the products were already in shortage, which is good news and bad news, says Fox, who is also a national expert on drug shortages. The bad news is those shortages will continue for things like certain formulations of lidocaine, a local anesthetic. But the good news is hospitals already know how to cope.\n\n\"If there had to be this tornado, it seems like this is probably one of the best-case scenarios where, you know, manufacturing lines aren't impacted, and it was an area of the facility that can be fairly quickly rebuilt,\" Fox says. \"And so it's not a time to panic.\"\n\nShe expects the ripple effects of this to last a few months rather than a few years.\n\nClimate change puts drug factories at risk\nConti, of Boston University, says the tornado is a good reminder about the vulnerabilities in the U.S. drug supply. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the damage caused shortages of IV saline bags.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the United States requires access to water and has traditionally been located in places such as Puerto Rico, the Gulf states and other locations that are now vulnerable to climate change,\" Conti says.\n\nThe weather events could serve as a warning.\n\nRedundancy is also important in the drug supply chain so that when something halts production at one factory \u2014 whether it's a tornado or a bad inspection \u2014 it's not the end of the world.\n\n\"There are approximately 230 drugs in short supply currently in the United States,\" Conti says. \"The Pfizer plant will definitely take down another couple of dozen drugs, and a handful of those will likely go into shortage, or the shortages will become more persistent because of what happened. However, there are somewhere on the order of 6,000 drugs sold into the U.S. market every single day.\"\n\nShe says it's important to remember that despite all the challenges, the U.S. drug supply is resilient and \"remarkably high quality.\"\n\n\"Our system remains the gold standard for the world,\" she says.","labels":["natural_disasters"]}

In this context, the Tucano Group commenced a private competitive process to seek market investors that would be willing and able to fund and take over the operations of the Mina Tucano. The Tucano Group engaged in negotiations with several potential investors, which led to the execution of fourteen confidentiality agreements and the receipt of three binding offers.\n\nPilar Gold Inc.

This offer was by far the best offer received by the Tucano Group from the technical and financial aspects combined, notably due to Pilar's ability to propose the best payment conditions to creditors of the Tucano Group in comparison to the other competitors, as well as to demonstrate the necessary financial conditions to swiftly resume operations in Mina Tucano and honor the offer in its entirety. Based on such offer, the Tucano Group and Tucano Gold Inc. (\"Buyer\"), a vehicle specifically constituted for the Transaction, entered into a Quota Purchase and Sale Agreement.\n\nThe Transaction comprises inter alia (i) the acquisition of the shares issued by Mina Tucano and Tucano Resources; (ii) the capitalization of Mina Tucano so that it can resume its operations at the mine site; and (iii) certain terms and conditions for the repayment of creditors of Mina Tucano. The completion of the Transaction, with the transfer of the shares of Mina Tucano and Tucano Resources to the Buyer, is subject to certain conditions precedent that are usual in transactions of this nature, including the approval of the Plan by the Judicial Reorganization creditors of the Tucano Group.\n\nMina Tucano and its Shareholders are confident that the Transaction is the best and most comprehensive solution to the challenges that led to the filing of the Judicial Reorganization, allowing an expedited continuation of the operations of Mina Tucano and therefore generation of value to creditors, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Tucano Group and the Buyer continue to hold productive discussions with the creditors of the Tucano Group, which we expect to lead to a Plan approval in the next general meeting of creditors scheduled for September 15, 2023.\n\nThe Company will continue keeping its creditors informed about the development of the matters addressed under this notice and is available for any clarification the creditors deem necessary.","labels":["financial_distress"]}

The Journal said that in 2019, chief financial officer Tiffany Kice, made the discoveries and left the company. Three board members and other c-suite executives left the company within months.\n\nGWG Holdings, a company that invested in Beneficient, defaulted on $2 billion in debt last year and filed bankruptcy, leaving individual investors with as much as $1.3 billion in potential losses, the article reported.\n\nThe Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. and Murdoch is chairman of Fox Corp., which settled a two-year lawsuit in April by paying Dominion $787 million, believed to be a record settlement in a media case, to end the legal battle over the network spreading lies about the 2020 election.\n\nBeneficient said in its complaint that \u201cGladstone has purposefully disregarded critical facts, distorted critical timelines and cherry-picked the information he has received to promote an overarching, pre-ordained conclusion: Brad Heppner, through his control of Beneficient and other companies, engineered self-serving transaction to enrich himself \u2013 and maintain a so-called \u2018lavish lifestyle\u2019 \u2013 at the expense of vulnerable and elderly \u2018retail\u2019 investors.\u201d\n\nThe complaint went on to say that Heppner can prove the statement is false and that Gladstone published his stories with \u201cmalice.\u201d\n\nGladstone hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment and The Journal declined to comment. Beneficient declined to comment.\n\nA tweet from Gladstone a year ago called out Heppner\u2019s ranch in Anderson County saying its debt was funded by transfers from Beneficient and its former parent company, GWG Holdings, which is in the process of a bankruptcy court-led reorganization.\n\nOther prominent Twitter accounts piled on with likes and replies, according to Beneficient\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cGladstone\u2019s Twitter audience \u2014 and others in the community \u2014 have taken Gladstone\u2019s allegations at face value and now believe that Heppner and Beneficient acted improperly,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nHeppner purchased the Bradley Oaks Ranch in 2003, according to the lawsuit, which noted that was 16 years before GWG started investing what ended up being a total of $230 million in Beneficient.\n\nBeneficient disclosed in its annual filing that on June 29 the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the company and Heppner that the agency\u2019s staff had made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file a civil enforcement action against the company, alleging SEC violations relating to Beneficient\u2019s association with GWG.\n\nBeneficient had a partnership with GWG before separating into an independent company in November 2021, the lawsuit said. Heppner joined the GWG board in April 2019 as chairman, but the lawsuit says that he was not a member of the special committees that decided to invest in Beneficient.\n\nGWG, which issued high-yield bonds that financed the purchase of life insurance policies on the secondary market, filed for bankruptcy in April 2022 after it missed interest payments to bondholders. GWG had previously disclosed that the SEC was investigating its accounting practices, according to regulatory filings.\n\nCurrent and former Beneficient and GWG board members are high-profile individuals including two former Federal Reserve Bank district presidents. Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach who built a large commercial real estate company is no longer a board member.\n\nFormer Dallas Fed Bank president Richard Fisher, former Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and leverage buyout financier Tom Hicks are current Beneficient directors.\n\n\nFriday\u2019s article in The Journal said Fisher, Lockhart and others have been accused in court filings \u201cof facilitating a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Heppner.\u201d\n\nBeneficient went public in June after it was acquired last year by Avalon Acquisition with the intention of taking it public through its SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company structure. Beneficient ended up raising about $8 million from the IPO, according to The Journal.","labels":["investments"]}

{"text":"August 31, 2023 - In July 2023, two federal district court judges in the Southern District of New York issued rulings that touched on a crucial question for the digital asset space \u2014 whether secondary market digital asset sales through trading platforms constitute securities transactions subject to the federal securities laws.\n\nOn July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment decision in SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc., No. 20 Civ. 10832, ECF No. 874 (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2023), holding in part that Ripple's sales of XRP through trading platforms did not constitute securities transactions while its direct sales to institutional investors did. In contrast, on July 31, 2023, Judge Jed Rakoff rejected Judge Torres' distinction based on how the digital assets were sold in SEC v. Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd., No. 23 Civ. 01346, ECF No. 51 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2023), denying defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission's claims that they violated federal securities laws in part by selling various digital assets through trading platforms.\n\nAlthough Judge Torres and Judge Rakoff disagreed on whether sales through trading platforms may constitute securities transactions, the facts and procedural postures of the two cases differ in meaningful ways that may explain the outcomes and shed light on how future courts may view this legal issue.\n\nBackground\nRipple develops and manages a digital asset exchange network that operates on the XRP Ledger blockchain. When the XRP Ledger launched, a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP tokens were generated to facilitate international currency transactions. Ripple received 80 billion XRP, some of which it sold and transferred in three ways: (i) directly to counterparties \u2014 primarily institutional buyers \u2014 pursuant to written contracts (\"Institutional Sales\"); (ii) on trading platforms through the use of trading algorithms (\"Programmatic Sales\"); and (iii) to employees and third parties as a form of payment for services (\"Other Distributions\").\n\nTerraform develops and manages an ecosystem of digital assets and launched the Terra blockchain to record transactions in two of its digital assets, TerraUSD (\"UST\") and a companion cryptocurrency called \"LUNA.\" UST was developed as an algorithmic stablecoin, which in this case meant its price was algorithmically pegged to another asset, the U.S. dollar.\n\nFor a while, one UST could be traded for $1 of LUNA, and $1 of LUNA could be traded for one UST. Owners of UST could also deposit their tokens into a smart contract associated with the \"Anchor Protocol\" to earn returns Terraform allegedly advertised as 19-20%, to be derived through lending UST deposits to borrowers. Terraform allegedly sold UST, LUNA and three other digital assets \u2014 \"wLUNA,\" \"mAssets,\" and \"MIR\" \u2014 directly to institutional investors and through trading platforms to U.S. retail investors.\n\nThe SEC brought enforcement actions against Ripple and Terraform (and certain of their executives) in 2018 and 2023, respectively, alleging that the defendants' sales and distributions constituted unregistered sales of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nDecisions\nUnder the federal securities laws, investment contracts are a type of security and, therefore, their sale must comply with registration requirements. In Ripple and Terraform, the parties disputed whether the digital asset sales and distributions were investment contracts.\n\nBoth courts relied on the same body of law dealing with investment contracts stemming from and including SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946). To determine whether a transaction is an investment contract, courts assess whether a person (i) invests his money (ii) in a common enterprise and (iii) has a reasonable expectation of profit based on the entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of the promoter. Howey, 328 U.S. at 299.\n\nSEC v. Ripple\nIn an order deciding competing summary judgment motions, Judge Torres analyzed the three categories of transactions in which Ripple engaged and found that only the Institutional Sales were offered and sold as investment contracts.\n\nIn assessing the third prong of the Howey test for the Institutional Sales, the court found that the institutional investors had a reasonable expectation of profits derived from Ripple's efforts, noting that, \"[f]rom Ripple's communications, marketing campaign, and the nature of the Institutional Sales, reasonable investors would understand that Ripple would use the capital received from its Institutional Sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP Ledger, thereby increasing the value of XRP.\" Ripple Labs, ECF No. 874 at 19.\n\nImportantly, the court determined the Programmatic Sales \u2014 Ripple's sales on digital asset trading platforms \u2014 did not constitute investment contracts because the \"expectation of profits\" prong of Howey was not met. The court noted these sales occurred on secondary trading platforms that match buyers and sellers without disclosing the identity of either.\n\nBecause the buyers in Programmatic Sales did not know they were buying XRP from Ripple, the court found they did not reasonably expect that Ripple would use their funds to increase the value of XRP. Contrasting these buyers to the purchasers in Institutional Sales, the court also concluded that, due to their lack of sophistication, there was no evidence the buyers in Programmatic Sales had their expectations informed by Ripple's public statements and, therefore, the court did not consider Ripple's statements in its analysis.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 2023, the SEC filed a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal of the court's ruling on Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions.\n\nSEC v. Terraform\nIn deciding the motion to dismiss in Terraform, Judge Rakoff was required to accept as true the allegations in the SEC's complaint. At that juncture, the court held that the SEC adequately pled that Terraform's sales of its various digital assets were investment contracts.\n\nWhen considering the SEC's allegations regarding secondary market sales to retail investors, the Terraform court stated that it \"reject[ed] the approach recently adopted\" by Judge Torres in Ripple and declined to distinguish between the assets sold directly to institutional investors and the assets sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors. Terraform Labs, ECF No. 51 at 40.\n\nThe court explained, \"[t]hat a purchaser bought the tokens directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary re-sale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants' actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.\"\n\nIn contrast to Ripple, the Terraform court considered defendants' public statements, accepted as true, including that Terraform and its founder promised all purchasers \"rates of returns of 19-20%\" and that \"sales from purchases of all crypto-assets \u2014 no matter where the tokens were purchased \u2014 would be fed back into the Terraform blockchain and would generate additional profits for all crypto-asset holders.\" The court concluded that these alleged statements gave secondary-market purchasers good reason to believe that Terraform would use their capital contributions to generate profits on their behalf.\n\nAnalysis and implications\nThe question of whether digital asset sales on trading platforms constitute securities transactions is of central importance to the SEC's broader enforcement initiatives, as the SEC recognized in its Aug. 18, 2023, motion seeking an interlocutory appeal in Ripple. While we await further potential guidance from the 2d U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a closer look at the facts in Ripple and Terraform may provide insights into why the district courts reached seemingly different conclusions.\n\nAlthough Judge Rakoff stated that he rejected Judge Torres's ruling on Programmatic Sales, that rejection does not appear to have been a total one. Both decisions sought to answer the same two questions. First, can an unsophisticated purchaser have an expectation of profit informed by the promoter's marketing campaign and public statements? And, second, could secondary-market purchasers who buy from unknown sellers reasonably expect profits based on the promoters' use of the money paid by the buyer?\n\nAs to the first question, Judge Rakoff, in deciding a motion to dismiss, answered \"yes.\" Judge Torres, in deciding competing motions for summary judgment, ruled that the record demonstrated that Ripple's statements were made across various platforms and were sometimes inconsistent, and thus there was no evidence that an unsophisticated purchaser would have had a reasonable expectation of profit based on this varied collection of statements.\n\nOn the second question, both judges appear to have aligned on the answer. Given this consistency, the differing results of the two decisions appear to be more driven by important factual distinctions and procedural posture than differing legal analysis.\n\nIn answering the second question, Judge Torres ruled that the evidentiary record failed to show that secondary-market purchasers had a reason to believe their sales proceeds would be used by the promoters to generate profits for purchasers because sales on secondary markets are not typically made by the issuer or promoter but rather by unknown third parties. Unlike in Ripple, the SEC in Terraform alleged that the defendants told all purchasers that funds from all digital asset sales \u2014 including those on secondary markets \u2014 would be fed back into the Terraform ecosystem to generate profits for purchasers.\n\nGiven this allegation (assumed as true at the pleading stage), Judge Rakoff ruled that \"secondary-market purchasers had every bit as good a reason to believe that the defendants would take their capital contributions and use it to generate profits on their behalf.\" Terraform Labs, ECF No. 51 at 42.\n\nIn Ripple, however, even if Judge Torres agreed with Judge Rakoff on the answer to the first question, there was no evidence of a comparable statement being made by the defendants. And, conversely, given Judge Rakoff's heavy reliance on this uncommon allegation, it is not clear he would have reached the same result if that allegation was not made.\n\nAlthough it was not directly addressed by either decision, it is possible that these factual distinctions would also impact how a court might analyze the \"common enterprise\" prong of Howey when evaluating secondary market sales not made by the issuer. In those circumstances, purchasers' funds would not be pooled and used by the promoters to generate profits, but would go to myriad unknown third parties who would not use the funds to generate profits for the purchasers.\n\nNotably, Ripple and Terraform are both SEC enforcement actions against digital asset issuers rather than secondary trading platforms. Because those who act as a broker-dealer or an exchange for securities may be required to register with the SEC, the treatment of secondary market sales under the Howey test will likely have profound implications for many digital asset trading platforms. Because many (if not most) digital asset issuers do not claim, as was alleged in Terraform, that secondary market sales proceeds will be used to generate profits, it is possible that the Terraform decision may be limited in future decisions to its unique alleged facts.","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"Minneapolis\nCNN\n \u2014 \nThe pandemic dislodged the global supply chain, hurling once smoothly running businesses, industries and economies into a state of disarray.\n\nAfter almost three years of enduring wild swings and extremes, the system is slowly getting up to speed and into better sync: Ocean freight timelines are on a steady decline, ports are less congested, labor strikes have been narrowly averted, product and worker shortages have eased, prices have fallen, warehouses are full (maybe too full), friendshoring, nearshoring and reshoring efforts have accelerated and China has lifted its \u201czero Covid\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a fundamental shift that started about six months ago,\u201d said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management. \u201cThere are certain components, like integrated circuits [and] microcontrollers, that still are impacting manufacturers\u2019 ability to flow material. But, by and large, the pressure has come off.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, plenty of potential roadblocks still loom large.\n\nGlobally, developments in China and Ukraine remain ongoing question marks, especially if the manufacturing megapower suffers another setback or lockdown, or if conditions worsen with Russia\u2019s war in Europe.\n\nDomestically, exports have weakened and the state of consumer demand remains a wild card, said Phil Levy, chief economist with freight forwarder and consultancy firm Flexport.\n\n\u201cI would not describe this as a machine that\u2019s humming along at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more getting its bearings and trying to figure out what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nAmong the potential bottlenecks: Warehousing capacity in certain locales, notably Southern California, is pretty near full, he said. Additionally, the inland distribution network \u2014 especially rail and areas where transfers are made from one mode to another \u2014 has experienced some challenges, he said.\n\nThe system isn\u2019t yet at a steady state where businesses have a good sense of how long it will take for production, shipping and, ultimately, selling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have that,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about how long it takes to move stuff. When we see the warehouses piled full, is this because demand is too low? Is it because people moved stuff too early? So there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s still sorting out.\u201d\n\nReturning to normal\nSupply chain activity has yet to normalize, but it\u2019s returning to pre-pandemic trajectories, said Zac Rogers, assistant professor of operations and supply chain management at Colorado State University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of reaction-overreaction pattern that always tends to happen anytime there\u2019s a major disruption,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cAnd Covid is the major-est disruption we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nEarly in the pandemic, businesses canceled orders, believing consumer spending would be crushed. However, trillions of dollars were injected into the economy to try to keep consumers and businesses afloat. Americans, stuck at home with fewer outlets for discretionary spending, turned to e-commerce for their shopping.\n\nThe surge in demand for finished goods at a time when supply was severely limited in part due to pandemic-related labor shortages and shutdowns \u2014notably of cities, factories and manufacturing hubs in China \u2014 knocked the global logistics system out of whack.\n\nPorts grew congested, lead times got lengthy, and costs climbed considerably higher as shortages spiked throughout the supply chain.\n\n\u201cEveryone way over-ordered, and around February and March of [last] year, everything got here \u2014 pretty much right in time for the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nVCG\/VCG\/Getty Images\nGas prices and inflation soared, putting a huge dent in consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the last 10 months in supply chains has been to try to thread the needle between bringing inventories down to a reasonable level, while also not overreacting, yet again, and [landing] back into a shortage situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting back toward the trend line in a way that we haven\u2019t in the last few years.\u201d\n\nReshoring and smoother flows\nHelping that along is that supply chains are far more resilient now than they were at the end of 2019, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we had basically all of our chips in on one hand, which was, things are built in East Asia, come on a boat through the ports in Southern California, they get on trains that go to Chicago and then on other trains or trucks to distribute to the East Coast,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s nearly impossible to divorce from China, companies are embracing different paths for the supply chain, whether it be in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Central America or domestically, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cBecause of that, supply chains are not as brittle as they were three years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so if there is another shock \u2014 particularly if there\u2019s a China-centric shock \u2014 I think we\u2019ll be able to absorb it a little better than we had. \u2026 But you can\u2019t price in something like the invasion of Ukraine or a viral outbreak that shuts down the world \u2014 no systems are built to handle that smoothly.\u201d\n\nRogers is also a researcher and co-author of the Logistics Managers\u2019 Index, a monthly survey of supply chain executives conducted by a team of university researchers and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals.\n\nThe index\u2019s December reading \u2014 which measures inventory levels and costs; warehousing capacity; utilization and prices; and transportation capacity, utilization and prices \u2014 came in at 54.6, a 1-point increase following eight months of declines.\n\nThe majority of the LMI metrics were in the range of 40s, 50s and 60s, Rogers said, noting it\u2019s the first time since the onset of the pandemic that the indices haven\u2019t been in the 70s or 80s.\n\nThe container ship Ever Libra (TW) is moored at the Port of Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 21, 2022. The supply backlogs of the past two years -- and the delays, shortages and outrageous prices they brought with them -- have improved dramatically since summer. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in 40, that\u2019s contraction, but 50s are normal, healthy rates of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be another huge black swan event in a month that throws everything upside down; but for right now, it seems like respondents are predicting steadiness in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nIf anything, the pandemic\u2019s shock to the supply chain should be a wake-up call, said Jack Buffington, director of supply chain and sustainability at First Key Consulting and assistant professor of supply chain management at the University of Denver.\n\n\u201cI would categorize it as \u2018efficiently broken,\u2019\u201d said Buffington, whose own book about supply chains, \u201cReinventing the Supply Chain: A 21st Century Covenant with America,\u201d had its release delayed due to supply chain issues.\n\n\u201cAll supply chains really are is supply and demand, and there\u2019s been so much disruption in materials and consumer demand related to labor and inflation and geopolitics,\u201d he said. \u201cInherently, the foundation of the model is broken in comparison to what the demands are for today. The complexities related to a globalized supply chain, human systems aren\u2019t capable of handling it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCovid wasn\u2019t the cause of the problems with the supply chain, it was a trigger to show how bad it was,\u201d he said.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"The international air freight industry, also known as the air cargo industry, experienced record high rates in the spring of 2020. Typically, about 45 percent to 50 percent of air freight is transported in the bellies of passenger planes, but in April 2020, 75 percent of this air freight capacity was removed from the market due to a severe reduction in air travel.1 At the same time, personal protective equipment (PPE) was in enormous demand all over the world.2 Drastically reduced shipping capacity and urgent demand for PPE pushed prices up for air freight transportation services for goods being shipped from foreign countries into the United States, also known as U.S. inbound air freight, to unprecedented heights.\n\nThis Beyond the Numbers article looks back at pre-pandemic inbound air freight price trends in the United States and around the world and uses U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) price index measures to describe the COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in the market since early 2020.\n\nU.S. and worldwide trends\nIn 2019, 6.7 million air freight tons were shipped to the United States from foreign countries according to the Department of Transportation.3 Asia is the top source of U.S. inbound merchandise goods shipped via air. As seen in table 1, China contributed the most, with over 842,000 freight tons, followed by Hong Kong, which shipped just under 700,000 freight tons in 2019. Inbound air freight is carried by both domestic and foreign carriers. The value of air freight transportation services provided solely by foreign carriers destined for U.S. markets was $8.5 billion in 2019.4 The dollar value for the delivery services to the United States on foreign carriers was highest from South Korea at $1.1 billion, followed by China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan. When combined, these five countries accounted for 43.9 percent of the inbound freight ton total and 50.9 percent of the total dollar value of import air freight transportation services.\n\nTable 1. Top five U.S. import air freight transportation services trade partners by import dollar value and their inbound freight tons for 2019 \nCountry\tImport dollar value (in millions)\tInbound freight ton totals (in thousands)\nSouth Korea\n\nThe international air cargo market is a smaller share of cross-border trade than ocean cargo transported on freighters. Some international cargo is transported by air on cargo and passenger planes when shippers are willing to pay the high cost to quickly deliver the goods. Air cargo services are typically used for high-value and perishable items. Air cargo demand is cyclical and depends on various factors such as global economic activity, the business restocking cycle, and export orders.5 Worldwide, the international air freight industry experienced strong growth in 2017, with demand, measured in cargo ton kilometers, increasing almost 10 percent and total cargo revenue ton-miles increasing 12.9 percent.6 Starting in 2018, demand slowed to an increase of 3.6 percent, with a corresponding total cargo revenue ton-miles increasing 5.6 percent. The industry experienced some setbacks in 2019 because of economic decline related to international trade disputes. Demand fell 3.9 percent that year in response, the first decrease since 2012. Total revenue ton-miles declined 7.0 percent in 2019. International air freight capacity, measured in available cargo ton-kilometers, increased 3.9 percent in 2017, 5.3 percent in 2018, and 1.6 percent in 2019. Air freight rates typically increase in the fourth quarter each year due to the holiday demand and then taper off after the New Year.7 U.S. trends mirrored world trends; over the 2016\u201319 period, the December 12-month percent change of the Inbound Air Freight Price Index was 7.7 percent in 2017, 5.2 percent in 2018, and -6.6 percent in 2019.\n\nInbound prices ascended then descended\nInternational air freight price indexes published by BLS measure monthly price changes for transporting consolidated shipments and individual packages on flights arriving and departing the United States on both foreign carriers and U.S. carriers. Prices are collected for all areas of the world and account for both the direction of transport and residency of the companies providing and buying air freight services. Inbound air freight price indexes measure the monthly price changes of air freight flown from foreign countries into the United States on both U.S. and foreign carriers. Price indexes are available for all-world inbound air freight and for Asia and Europe, the two major trading regions beyond North America. Further details regarding the methodology of international air freight price indexes published by BLS can be found in the Air Freight Fact Sheet.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, inbound air freight price trends for the United States followed world trends. Looking at the regional impact (chart 1), we can see how a 39.8-percent increase in inbound Asian air freight prices drove the overall price index\u2019s advance from June 2016 to November 2018. Prices then declined over the subsequent 10-month period. Both Asian and European inbound air freight prices contributed to the fall, decreasing 14.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, from November 2018 to September 2019.\n\nChart 1. Inbound air freight price indexes, December 2015 to December 2020\nLine chart with 3 lines.\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories.\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Index (Dec 2015 = 100). Data ranges from 88.2 to 190.9.\nEnd of interactive chart.\nView Chart Data\nInbound air freight prices began to increase in October 2019. They rose throughout the remainder of the year and into earlier 2020, capping off with record-breaking price advances in April and May. Before April, increases in the Inbound Air Freight Price Index for Asia offset relatively minor declines in the Inbound Air Freight Price Index for Europe. Inbound air freight prices then recorded increases of 23.6 percent from March to April and 18.7 percent from April to May, led by record-breaking advances in air freight prices from Asia. The rise in April was the largest 1-month advance since the price index was published on a monthly basis, and the increase in May was the second largest. The magnitude of the changes was caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPlanes grounded while demand takes off\nBeginning in March 2020, the international economy experienced widespread lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This affected the airline industry because airlines stopped flying passenger planes, especially those designated for international travel. Considering that almost half of air cargo is flown in the bellies of passenger planes, the airline industry decided to ground these planes, severely restricting the overall capacity of air freight. According to Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service, the number of commercial flights (including cargo flights) dropped from 81,309 on March 18, 2020, to 23,926 on April 12, 2020, an astounding 70.6 percent.8\n\nFrom March through May 2020, drastic changes in the air freight market affected both capacity and prices worldwide. Global capacity drastically reduced starting in March 2020. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that international capacity declined almost 25 percent year-over-year in March 2020 and continued to decline on a 12-month basis, decreasing 40.9 percent in April, 32.2 percent in May, 33.9 percent in June, and 32.9 percent in July.9 Global air freight demand declined drastically as well while manufacturing capabilities stalled around the world. In addition, the IATA reported that total capacity in April, including domestic and international, contracted 27.7 percent over the past year, the largest drop since the series was first published in 1990. When capacity declined, this sharp reduction caused cargo load factors, the capacity that is actually utilized, to rise; shippers used more of the available space\u2014planes were fuller. For example, the international Asia Pacific cargo load factor reached 72.1 percent for the year ended in April 2020, an increase of 14.4 percent from April 2019. A 42.5-percent decline in capacity over the same period more than offset a 28.1-percent drop in demand. The Europe region experienced similar capacity restraints and a demand decline. The advance in the Asia Pacific and Europe cargo load factors showcased not only the fall in capacity, but also the enormous need for cargo space to quickly transport PPE to the United States. In addition, daily freighter utilization, defined as average travel time per plane, was close to 11 hours a day, the highest level since IATA started publishing the data in 2012.  \n\nRestricted capacity and U.S. demand for PPE, which primarily came from Asia, contributed to U.S. inbound air freight prices spiking in April and May of 2020. As seen in table 2, the Inbound Air Freight Price Index increased 23.6 percent from March to April and 18.7 percent from April to May. Before April 2020, the largest 1-month advance was a 6.3-percent rise in July 2017. Both European and Asian inbound air freight prices contributed to the increase from March to April 2020, rising 25.2 percent and 27.8 percent, respectively. These advances were the largest 1-month increases since the price indexes were first published on a monthly basis in December 2005. Inbound air freight prices from Asia drove the rise in May, advancing 31.4 percent and setting a new monthly record, while inbound air freight prices from Europe fell 1.0 percent.\n\nTo cope with the sudden supply and demand changes, airlines around the world converted their passenger planes into cargo-only, either by securing shipments and packages onto their planes\u2019 seats or by removing the seats in order to make space for freight.10 By the end of April 2020, roughly 900 passenger planes were exclusively used for cargo transportation around the globe.11 On May 22, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an exemption allowing various U.S. airlines to secure freight on top of and under their planes\u2019 seats when no passengers were being transported.12 By mid-June, the total number of passenger planes used solely for cargo transportation increased to over 2,300.13 On July 10, another exemption was issued allowing airlines to remove seats and secure cargo using the now unused seat tracks.14 As of late August, nearly 2,500 passenger planes were used solely for freight-only flights.15\n\nThe new normal?\nInbound air freight prices fell after the April 2020 and May 2020 increases, declining 2.5 percent from May to June and 9.9 percent from June to July. Despite the monthly decreases, the effects of the price shocks continued to linger. Before April 2020, the largest 12-month advance was a 21.8-percent increase from July 2007 to July 2008. The over-the-year increases recorded from March 2020 to March 2021 all exceeded the July 2008 12-month advance, including a 47.2-percent rise from May 2019 to May 2020, the new high-water mark. While prices remained elevated, strong pre-holiday demand for the months leading into December contributed to 1-month advances in the Inbound Air Freight Price Index which rose 3.0 percent in October 2020 and 6.3 percent in November 2020. Coinciding with the end of the seasonal demand was the beginning of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, further straining available air cargo capacity.16 Inbound air freight prices had a 1-month advance of 6.5 percent in December 2020.\n\nVaccine distribution continues to be a demand factor for air freight transporters to consider throughout 2021. Also, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and improving conditions for the global economy are all affecting air freight prices.17 Although inbound air freight prices declined between December 2020 and March 2021, the price index remains high. Until passenger planes are flying internationally again, the current situation is likely to be the new normal.18\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"Small-batch customs seizures barely scratch the surface of how deeply cotton from Xinjiang is embedded in the global supply chain\n\nAt the onset of the decade, the widespread repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur community in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang prompted action. Much of the world decided to stop doing business with the region guilty of a plethora of human rights violations. In December 2021, US president Joe Biden even signed legislation barring goods made with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China from entering the US market.\n\nThe on-paper ban hasn\u2019t been so straightforward to implement on the ground, though. Finding partners that can provide equally abundant and similarly cheap cotton has been a task, and keeping the supply chain clean is onerous.\n\nIn Germany, researchers found traces of Xinjiang cotton in Adidas, Puma, and Hugo Boss in mid-2022. French prosecutors went after Zara, Uniqlo, and Sketchers. Basically, staying has its costs\u2014reputational damage, legal repercussions, and boycotts in China\u2014but leaving isn\u2019t easy either.\n\nNow, US authorities have more evidence that Xinjiang cotton is perhaps too deeply embedded in the global supply chain, and continues to make its way into the US. Roughly 27% of tests\u201410 out of 37\u2014performed on apparel and shoes collected by US Customs and Border Protection in May showed links to cotton from China\u2019s Xinjiang region, Reuters reported for the first time on Sept. 1, citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nThis testing in double-digits barely scratches the surface, considering the US imports millions of dollars worth of apparel and shoes each day. And Chinese cotton doesn\u2019t only come from China. Cotton and yarn produced in China is used extensively in other countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Bangladesh\u2014the world\u2019s largest producers of cotton clothing and consumer goods.\n\nQuotable: Hardly any apparel shipments are stopped and tested\n\u201cThe numbers are completely underwhelming. It\u2019s a few dozen shipments stopped. We\u2019re talking about thousands and millions of packages coming in that contain apparel items.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kim Glas, National Council of Textile Organizations, to Wall Street Journal in August 2023\n\nXinjiang cotton by Uyghur laborers, by the digits\n15%: Tests deemed to be consistent with Xinjiang, including seizures in May, April, and December of last year\n\n87%: Share of China\u2019s production that Xinjiang cotton accounts for\n\n23%: Xinjiang cotton in the global supply in 2020 and 2021\n\n100,000: Uyghurs and other ethnic minority ex-detainees that may be working in forced labor conditions in China, according to Department of Labor estimates \n\n53: Intermediary manufacturers\u2014from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Ethiopia, China, and Mexico\u2014that purchase unfinished cotton goods from five leading Chinese manufacturers (Huafu Fashion, Lianfa Textiles, Luthai Textiles, Texhong Textiles, and Weiqiao Textiles) that have sourced Xinjiang cotton, as per an October 2022 study by Britain\u2019s Sheffield Hallam University analyzing state and corporate records\n\n103: Well-known international brands that are supplied by those 53 intermediaries and are therefore at high risk of having Xinjiang cotton in their supply chains\n\nCompany of interest: Oritain\nCustoms officials and companies identify specific geographic origins of cotton using isotope analysis\u2014a sort of DNA test for cotton. Verification companies measure stable carbon, nitrogen, and other elements found in tested samples, and then compare those figures against a library of geographically distinct \u201cfingerprints\u201d to determine the origin of a particular sample.\n\nNew Zealand-headquartered Oritain is one of the prominent players in this industry.\n\nThe US Customs and Border Protection has made payments worth $1.3 million to Oritain since 2020 for cotton goods analysis, according to records from the agency obtained by Reuters under FOIA. (It\u2019s not clear if Oritain conducted the December 2022 or April and May 2023 tests.)\n\nCompanies also work with Oritain directly to keep their production practices traceable and transparent. For instance, lingerie brand Victoria\u2019s Secret, which requires that suppliers \u201cretain all documentation for the origin of raw material, processing and manufacturing,\u201d says Oritain testing may be conducted on the cotton used at any stage of the garment-making process\u2014on fiber, yarn, fabric, or finished goods.\n\nOf course, good intentions don\u2019t always translate to fair practices. Shein, the Chinese fast fashion into which the US launched a probe for sourcing cotton from the controversial Xinjiang region in May, contracts with Oritain, an isotopic testing company headquartered in New Zealand, to verify the origin of cotton in their supply chains. Ralph Lauren, which has been working with Oritain for years, is being investigated by Canada\u2019s corporate watchdog for allegedly benefiting from forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China as of this month.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

This year, extreme heat has ravaged many parts of the country even earlier than last year.\n\nPigs, rabbits and fish have been dying from the searing temperatures, and wheat fields in central China have been flooded by the heaviest rainfall in a decade. Meanwhile, officials are worried that drought could hit the Yangtze River basin, China\u2019s main rice-growing region, in the coming months.\n\nSince March, temperatures in dozens of Chinese cities have hit record seasonal highs. The heat wave has escalated in recent days, with a number of cities in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces suffering record-breaking temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nBy Wednesday, 578 national weather stations located in different cities across the country recorded their highest ever temperatures for this time of year, according to the China Meteorological Administration.\n\n\u201cExtreme weather such as drought and floods may disrupt the food production order and bring more uncertainties to the supply of food and oil,\u201d Sheng Xia, chief agricultural analyst for Citic Securities, wrote in a research report on Wednesday.\n\nHe warned of increasing threats to food security this year because of the looming El Ni\u00f1o, a natural phenomenon in the tropical Pacific Ocean that brings warmer-than-average temperatures. El Ni\u00f1o could, for the first time, push the world past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above the pre-industrial levels of the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\n\u201cFor China, the El Ni\u00f1o event will easily lead to increased climate uncertainty in the Yangtze River Basin, causing flooding in the south and drought in the north, and cold summer in the northeast,\u201d said Sheng.\n\nTourists holding umbrellas visit Shanghai during a heat wave on May 29, 2023.

In March, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said agriculture was the foundation of national security.\n\n\u201cOnce something\u2019s wrong with agriculture, our bowls will be held in someone else\u2019s hands and we\u2019ll have to depend on others for food. How can we achieve modernization in that case?\u201d he said in an article published in March by Qiushi, the Communist Party\u2019s main theoretical journal.\n\nAnimals killed\nIn recent days, reports of farm animals killed by extreme heat have dominated the news.\n\nAt a farm in eastern Jiangsu province, hundreds of pigs died this week after a sudden power outage caused fans to stop working at night, according to several state media reports.\n\nThe pigs suffocated to death amid extreme heat and poor air circulation, Jimu News, a government-owned news website, cited an unnamed employee at the farm as saying.\n\nThe heat wave was blamed for killing large numbers of farmed carp living in rice fields in the southwestern region of Guangxi. Villagers told the South of China Today newspaper on Wednesday that their fish were \u201cburned to death\u201d as water temperatures soared due to hot weather.\n\nThe prices of rabbit heads, a signature dish in Sichuan, have surged in recent days as high temperatures caused rabbit deaths on farms, resulting in tighter supply. Spicy rabbit heads are a popular street food in the southwestern province, where residents consume more than 200 million of the heads a year, according to industry association figures.\n\nCrops damaged\nExtreme weather conditions have also affected the country\u2019s largest wheat-growing region.\n\nHeavy rainfall flooded the wheat fields of Henan, a central province which accounts for a quarter of China\u2019s production, in the last week of May, just days before harvest time. The rains caused some grain crops to sprout or go moldy.

{"text":"OpenAI is trying to dismiss various claims in two legal actions launched by authors and comedians, who sued the machine-learning super-lab for scraping their books to train ChatGPT without explicit permission. \n\nIn June, novelists Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in the US over its harvesting of prose. Days later, comedian Sarah Silverman and novelists Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey also sued the biz. Both parties accused the ChatGPT maker of copyright infringement for ingesting their work to train the chatbot.\n\nOpenAI's lawyers have hit back, asking a federal court in San Francisco to dismiss five out six claims brought by Tremblay and Awad, those being: vicarious infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unfair competition, negligence, and unjust enrichment. It is, however, prepared to fight the first claim of direct copyright infringement in hope of winning it to make a point to any other creative person considering pursuing it.\n\nOpenAI made the same argument against Silverman et al's federal lawsuit, too, for what it's worth.\n\n\n\n\"This motion does not seek dismissal of Count I, for direct copyright infringement, which OpenAI will seek to resolve as a matter of law at a later stage of the case,\" the lab's legal eagles argued in court filings [PDF]. The lawyers believe most of the plaintiffs' accusations do not describe any actual law-breaking by OpenAI, and rest allegedly involve the biz directly infringing on the writers' intellectual property \u2013 allegations the organization denies. \n\nLawyers for the AI biz argued OpenAI has not violated copyright laws at all and that ChatGPT is protected under fair use. US copyright law states that \"transformative uses\" of work \u2013 where the original source is repurposed \u2013 is considered fair use. Although the large language model ingested the authors and comedian's books, it transformed their text for different applications. That's the argument, anyway. \n\n\"According to the complaints, every single ChatGPT output \u2013 from a simple response to a question (e.g., 'Yes'), to the name of the president of the United States, to a paragraph describing the plot, themes, and significance of Homer's The Iliad \u2013 is necessarily an infringing 'derivative work' of plaintiffs' books,\" they wrote in the court docs.\n\n\"Worse still, each of those outputs would simultaneously be an infringing derivative of each of the millions of other individual works contained in the training corpus \u2013 regardless of whether there are any similarities between the output and the training works. That is not how copyright law works,\" they concluded.\n\nAI and copyright is a contentious legal gray area. Similar lawsuits have been filed by visual artists, who claim companies like Stability AI have trained text-to-image models on their artwork. Although the US Copyright Office has declared that works which are \"not the product of human authorship\" cannot be protected, officials are unsure about other issues.\n\nThe office issued a request for public comment [PDF] this week on copyright law and policy issues raised by AI.\n\nThe Register has asked the plaintiffs' lawyers for comment.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"Incidents of cargo theft using fraud have been surging in the United States and Canada over the last few months, Verisk\u2019s CargoNet has warned.\n\nShipment misdirection schemes and fictitious pickups have risen almost 700% in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the same period last year.\n\nKeith Lewis (pictured), vice president of operations at CargoNet, told Insurance Business there has been \u201cunprecedented amounts\u201d of such incidents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emerging trend that we caught during the last couple months of 2022,\u201d he said.\n\n\nAt the same time, traditional cargo theft incidents in the US and Canada rose 57% to 582 incidents in Q2 2023, according to CargoNet\u2019s second-quarter report released in July. In total, more than $44 million in shipments were stolen during this period.\n\nThe average shipment value per event also increased nearly $100,000 to $260,703 per theft as cargo thieves focused on high-value shipments, CargoNet reported.\n\nShipping misdirection schemes on the rise\nSpeaking to Insurance Business, Lewis revealed that fraud schemes have become a global problem since the pandemic.\n\n\u201cDuring COVID, we learned we could work from anywhere in the world. So, what used to be a US- and Canada-based crime has become a global crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see a lot of folks committing high-level organized fraud in the United States as well as in other countries.\u201d\n\nShipping misdirection tactics use legitimate processes such as load boards to fraudulently acquire cargo. Attackers may pose as a motor carrier or logistics brokers to obtain their targeted shipment, then redirect it using a legitimate driver, Lewis explained.\n\n\u201cFreight moves almost like online dating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou match your type of equipment up with the type of load looking for a destination, and in one click the load is awarded to you if you meet the broker\u2019s criteria.\n\n\u201cThe frauds are committed when they pick up the load. It\u2019s not the distribution centers that are vulnerable; it\u2019s the way the loads are moving.\u201d\n\nCargoNet acknowledged significant growth in extortion and theft by conversion schemes, particularly among organized groups in Illinois and California.\n\nThese groups target shipments from logistics brokers, tacking on exorbitant fees for various manufactured reasons like overweight tickets or previous rate penalties charged to non-affiliated motor carriers. Criminal enforcement for these cases remains complex and rare, emboldening criminals.\n\nWhat do energy drinks, solar panels, and vehicle parts have in common?\nAccording to CargoNet, fictitious pickup groups stole shipments from 39 different product categories in the second quarter of 2023, but primarily focused their efforts on smaller groupings of freight.\n\nFood and beverage products, including alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic beverages such as soda and energy drinks, emerged as the top targets for thieves hijacking the supply chain.\n\nSolar power generation equipment and vehicle parts and supplies including fluids, oils, and tires are also popular stolen commodities.\n\nCargo and vehicle thefts \u2013 what\u2019s the link?\nThe car shortage during the pandemic has made vehicle parts more attractive targets for organized crime groups, according to Lewis, and has also contributed to the alarming rates of vehicle theft in Canada.\n\n\u201cSince COVID, there\u2019s been a shortage of cars, as well as parts, rebuilt engines, and even motor oil. That causes those products to be targeted more,\u201d he said.\n\nWorse, stolen freight often gets past customs checks at ports due to a lack of enforcement. The Equite Association, a Canadian not-for-profit organization against insurance crime, said that cargo losses in the country rose by nearly 30% in 2022 compared to the previous year.\n\n\u201cA police officer in Canada told me that they ship out about 15,000 containers a day from one port, but they just don\u2019t have enough people to inspect the containers,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere is a high number of vehicles being stolen in Canada right now, and it\u2019s because of the shortage of vehicles and vehicle parts.\u201d\n\nMitigating cargo theft risk\nLogistics brokers and shippers can help prevent fictitious cargo pickups by meticulously verifying shipping bids, particularly the name of the motor carrier and driver matches the shipment was tendered to.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems is the speed that we move freight. We move goods at a high velocity because when you slow down the flow of goods, you increase the cost and slow down the movement to the end-consumer,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cBetter vetting and slowing down the pace on the front end are important.\u201d\n\nCargoNet also advised motor carriers to be wary of new customers that want a blind shipment delivered to an unfamiliar address.\n\nFinally, Lewis advised freight companies to be vigilant about cargo theft threats and use industry intelligence to protect their shipments.\n\n\u201cThe bad actors are always going to get away with the first one or two loads,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then somebody is going to report it to us, and we\u2019re going to send out an alert or notice to the industry to be on the lookout for suspicious activity by that carrier. It\u2019s about using the data we provide to prevent thefts.\u201d\n\nShare your thoughts on cargo theft risks in the comments below.","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"When Russian forces marched on Kyiv in February 2022, few thought Ukraine could survive. Russia had more than twice as many soldiers as Ukraine. Its military budget was more than ten times as large. The U.S. intelligence community estimated that Kyiv would fall within one to two weeks at most.\n\nOutgunned and outmanned, Ukraine turned to one area in which it held an advantage over the enemy: technology. Shortly after the invasion, the Ukrainian government uploaded all its critical data to the cloud, so that it could safeguard information and keep functioning even if Russian missiles turned its ministerial offices into rubble. The country\u2019s Ministry of Digital Transformation, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had established just two years earlier, repurposed its e-government mobile app, Diia, for open-source intelligence collection, so that citizens could upload photos and videos of enemy military units. With their communications infrastructure in jeopardy, the Ukrainians turned to Starlink satellites and ground stations provided by SpaceX to stay connected. When Russia sent Iranian-made drones across the border, Ukraine acquired its own drones specially designed to intercept their attacks\u2014while its military learned how to use unfamiliar weapons supplied by Western allies. In the cat-and-mouse game of innovation, Ukraine simply proved nimbler. And so what Russia had imagined would be a quick and easy invasion has turned out to be anything but.\n\nUkraine\u2019s success can be credited in part to the resolve of the Ukrainian people, the weakness of the Russian military, and the strength of Western support. But it also owes to the defining new force of international politics: innovation power. Innovation power is the ability to invent, adopt, and adapt new technologies. It contributes to both hard and soft power. High-tech weapons systems increase military might, new platforms and the standards that govern them provide economic leverage, and cutting-edge research and technologies enhance global appeal. There is a long tradition of states harnessing innovation to project power abroad, but what has changed is the self-perpetuating nature of scientific advances. Developments in artificial intelligence in particular not only unlock new areas of scientific discovery; they also speed up that very process. Artificial intelligence supercharges the ability of scientists and engineers to discover ever more powerful technologies, fostering advances in artificial intelligence itself as well as in other fields\u2014and reshaping the world in the process.\n\nThe ability to innovate faster and better\u2014the foundation on which military, economic, and cultural power now rest\u2014will determine the outcome of the great-power competition between the United States and China. For now, the United States remains in the lead. But China is catching up in many areas and has already surged ahead in others. To emerge victorious from this century-defining contest, business as usual will not do. Instead, the U.S. government will have to overcome its stultified bureaucratic impulses, create favorable conditions for innovation, and invest in the tools and talent needed to kick-start the virtuous cycle of technological advancement. It needs to commit itself to promoting innovation in the service of the country and in the service of democracy. At stake is nothing less than the future of free societies, open markets, democratic government, and the broader world order.\n\nKNOWLEDGE IS POWER\nThe nexus between technological innovation and global domination dates back centuries, from the muskets the conquistador Francisco Pizarro wielded to defeat the Inca Empire to the steamboats Commodore Matthew Perry commanded to force the opening of Japan. But the sheer speed at which innovation is happening has no precedent. Nowhere is this change clearer than in one of the foundational technologies of our time: artificial intelligence.\n\nToday\u2019s AI systems can already provide key advantages in the military domain, where they are able to parse millions of inputs, identify patterns, and alert commanders to enemy activity. The Ukrainian military, for example, has used AI to efficiently scan intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data from a variety of sources. Increasingly, however, AI systems will move beyond merely assisting human decision-making and start making decisions themselves. John Boyd, a military strategist and U.S. Air Force colonel, coined the term \u201cOODA loop\u201d\u2014observe, orient, decide, act\u2014to describe the decision-making process in combat. Crucially, AI will be able to execute each part of the OODA loop much faster. Conflict can happen at the speed of computers, not the speed of people. As a result, command-and-control systems that rely on human decision-makers\u2014or, worse, complex military hierarchies\u2014will lose out to faster, more efficient systems that team machines with humans.\n\nIn previous eras, the technologies that shaped geopolitics\u2014from bronze to steel, steam power to nuclear fission\u2014were largely singular. There was a clear threshold of technological mastery, and once a country reached it, the playing field was leveled. Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is generative in nature. By presenting a platform for continuous scientific and technological innovation, it can lead to yet more innovation. That phenomenon makes the AI age fundamentally different from the Bronze Age or the steel age. Rather than natural resource wealth or mastery of a given technology, the source of a country\u2019s power now lies in its ability to continuously innovate.\n\nThis virtuous cycle will only get faster and faster. Once quantum computing comes of age, superfast computers will allow for the processing of ever-larger amounts of data, producing ever-smarter AI systems. These AI systems, in turn, will be able to produce breakthrough innovations in other emerging fields, from synthetic biology to semiconductor manufacturing. Artificial intelligence will change the very nature of scientific research. Instead of making progress one study at a time, scientists will discover the answers to age-old questions by analyzing massive data sets, freeing the world\u2019s smartest minds to devote more time to developing new ideas. As a foundational technology, AI will be critical in the race for innovation power, lying behind countless future developments in drug discovery, gene therapy, material science, and clean energy\u2014and in AI itself. Faster airplanes did not help build faster airplanes, but faster computers will help build faster computers. \n\nEven more powerful than today\u2019s artificial intelligence is a more comprehensive technology\u2014for now, given current computing power, still hypothetical\u2014called \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d or AGI. Whereas traditional AI is designed to solve a discrete problem, AGI should be able to perform any mental task a human can and more. Imagine an AI system that could answer seemingly intractable questions, such as the best way to teach a million children English or to treat a case of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The advent of AGI remains years, perhaps even decades, away, but whichever country develops the technology first will have a massive advantage, since it could then use AGI to develop ever more advanced versions of AGI, gaining an edge in all other domains of science and technology in the process. A breakthrough in this field could usher in an era of predominance not unlike the short period of nuclear superiority the United States enjoyed in the late 1940s.\n\n\n\nTesting a homemade drone in Kyiv, November 2022\nWhereas many of AI\u2019s most transformative effects are still far off, innovation in drones is already upending the battlefield. In 2020, Azerbaijan employed Turkish- and Israeli-made drones to gain a decisive advantage in its war against Armenia in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, racking up battlefield victories after more than two decades of military stalemate. Similarly, Ukraine\u2019s fleet of drones\u2014many of which are low-cost commercial models repurposed for reconnaissance behind enemy lines\u2014have played a critical role in its successes.\n\nDrones offer distinct advantages over traditional weapons: they are smaller and cheaper, offer unmatched surveillance capabilities, and reduce soldiers\u2019 risk exposure. Marines in urban warfare, for example, could be accompanied by microdrones that serve as their eyes and ears. Over time, countries will improve the hardware and software powering drones to outinnovate their rivals. Eventually, autonomous weaponized drones\u2014not just unmanned aerial vehicles but also ground-based ones\u2014will replace soldiers and manned artillery altogether. Imagine an autonomous submarine that could quickly move supplies into contested waters or an autonomous truck that could find the optimal route to carry small missile launchers across rough terrain. Swarms of drones, networked and coordinated by AI, could overwhelm tank and infantry formations in the field. In the Black Sea, Ukraine has used drones to attack Russian ships and supply vessels, helping a country with a minuscule navy constrain Russia\u2019s mighty Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine offers a preview of future conflicts: wars that will be waged and won by humans and machines working together.\n\nAs developments in drones make clear, innovation power underlies military power. First and foremost, technological dominance in crucial domains bolsters a country\u2019s ability to wage war and thus strengthens its deterrent capabilities. But innovation also shapes economic power by giving states leverage over supply chains and the ability to make the rules for others. Countries reliant on natural resources or trade, especially those that must import rare or foundational goods, face vulnerabilities others do not.\n\nConsider the power China can wield over the countries it supplies with communications hardware. It is no surprise that countries dependent on Chinese-supplied infrastructure\u2014such as many countries in Africa, where components produced by Huawei make up about 70 percent of 4G networks\u2014have been loath to criticize Chinese human rights violations. Taiwan\u2019s primacy in semiconductor manufacturing, likewise, provides a powerful deterrent against invasion, since China has little interest in destroying its largest source of microchips. Leverage also accrues to countries pioneering new technologies. The United States, thanks to its role in the foundation of the Internet, has for decades enjoyed a seat at the table defining Internet regulations. During the Arab Spring, for example, the fact that the United States was home to technology companies that provided the backbone of the Internet enabled those companies to refuse Arab governments\u2019 censorship requests.\n\nLess obvious but also crucial, technological innovation buoys a country\u2019s soft power. Hollywood and tech companies such as Netflix and YouTube have built up a trove of content for an increasingly global consumer base\u2014all the while, helping spread American values. Such streaming services project the American way of life into living rooms around the world. Similarly, the prestige associated with U.S. universities and the opportunities for wealth creation created by U.S. companies attract strivers from across the globe. In short, a country\u2019s ability to project power in the international sphere\u2014militarily, economically, and culturally\u2014depends on its ability to innovate faster and better than its competitors.\n\nRACE TO THE TOP\nThe main reason innovation now lends such a massive advantage is that it begets more innovation. In part, it does so because of the path dependency that arises from clusters of scientists attracting, teaching, and training other great scientists at research universities and large technology companies. But it also does so because innovation builds on itself. Innovation relies on a loop of invention, adoption, and adaptation\u2014a feedback cycle that fuels yet more innovation. If any link in the chain breaks, so, too, does a country\u2019s ability to innovate effectively.\n\nA lead in invention is typically built on years of prior research. Consider the way the United States led the world into the 4G era of telecommunications. The rollout of 4G networks across the country facilitated the early development of mobile applications such as Uber that required faster cellular data connections. With that lead, Uber was able to refine its product in the United States so it could roll it out in developing countries. This led to many more customers\u2014and much more feedback to incorporate\u2014as the company adapted its product for new markets and new releases.\n\nBut the moat around countries that enjoy structural advantages in technology is shrinking. Thanks in part to more accessible academic research and the rise of open-source software, technologies now diffuse more quickly around the world. The availability of new advances has helped competitors catch up at record speed, as China eventually did in 4G. Although some of China\u2019s recent technological success stems from economic espionage and a disregard for patents, much of it traces back to innovative, rather than derivative, efforts to adapt and implement new technology.\n\nIndeed, Chinese companies have enjoyed resounding success in adopting and commercializing foreign technological breakthroughs. In 2015, the Chinese Communist Party laid out its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy to achieve self-sufficiency in high-tech industries such as telecommunications and AI. As part of this bid, it announced an economic plan of \u201cdual circulation,\u201d whereby China intends to boost both domestic and foreign demand for its goods. Through public-private partnerships, direct subsidies to private companies, and support for state-backed companies, Beijing has poured billions of dollars into ensuring it comes out ahead in the race for technological supremacy. So far, the record is mixed. China is ahead of the United States in some technologies yet lags in others.\n\n\n\nAt a semiconductor factory in Huai'an, China, September 2022\nIt is hard to say whether China will seize the lead in AI, but top officials in Beijing certainly think it will. In 2017, Beijing announced plans to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, and it may achieve that goal even earlier than expected. China has already accomplished its goal of becoming the world\u2019s leader in AI-based surveillance technology, which it not only uses to control dissidents at home but also sells to authoritarian governments abroad. China still ranks behind the United States in attracting the best minds in AI, with almost 60 percent of top-tier researchers working in U.S. universities. But China\u2019s loose privacy laws, mandatory data collection, and targeted government funding give the country a key advantage. Indeed, it already leads in the production of autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor now, the United States still retains an edge in quantum computing. Yet over the past decade, China has invested at least $10 billion in quantum technology, roughly ten times as much as the U.S. government. China is working to build quantum computers so powerful that they will easily crack today\u2019s encryption. The country is also investing heavily in quantum networks\u2014a way of transmitting information in the form of quantum bits\u2014presumably in the hope that such networks would be impervious to monitoring by other intelligence agencies. Even more alarming, the Chinese government may already be storing stolen and intercepted communications with an eye to decrypting them once it possesses the computing power to do so, a strategy known as \u201cstore now, decrypt later.\u201d When quantum computers become fast enough, all communications encrypted through non-quantum methods will be at risk for interception, raising the stakes of achieving this breakthrough first.\n\nChina is also actively trying to catch up with the United States in synthetic biology. Scientists in this field are working on a range of new biological developments, including microbe-made cement that absorbs carbon dioxide, crops with an increased ability to sequester carbon, and plant-based meat substitutes. Such technology holds enormous promise to fight climate change and create jobs, but since 2019, Chinese private investment in synthetic biology has outpaced U.S. investment.\n\nWhen it comes to semiconductors, China has ambitious plans, too. The Chinese government is funding unprecedented efforts to become a leader in semiconductor manufacturing by 2030. Chinese companies are currently creating what are known in the industry as \u201cseven nanometer\u201d chips, but Beijing has set its sights further, announcing plans to domestically produce the new generation of \u201cfive nanometer\u201d chips. For now, the United States continues to outperform China in semiconductor design, as do U.S.-aligned Taiwan and South Korea. In October 2022, the Biden administration took the important step of blocking leading U.S. companies producing AI computer chips from selling to China as part of a package of restrictions released by the Department of Commerce. Yet Chinese companies control 85 percent of the processing of the rare-earth minerals that go into these chips and other critical electronics, offering an important point of leverage over their competitors. \n\nA BATTLE OF SYSTEMS\nThe competition between the United States and China is as much a competition between systems as it is between states. In the Chinese model of civil-military fusion, the government promotes domestic competition and funds emerging winners as \u201cnational champions.\u201d These companies play a dual role, maximizing commercial success and advancing Chinese national security interests. The American model, on the other hand, relies on a more disparate set of private actors. The federal government provides funding to basic science but largely leaves innovation and commercialization to the market. \n\nFor a long time, the trifecta of government, industry, and academia was the primary source of American innovation. This collaboration drove many technological breakthroughs, from the moon landing to the Internet. But with the end of the Cold War, the U.S. government grew averse to allocating funding for applied research, and it even lowered the amount devoted to fundamental research. Although private spending has taken off, public investments have plateaued over the past half century. In 2015, the share of government funding for basic research dropped below 50 percent for the first time since the end of World War II, having hovered around 70 percent in the 1960s. Meanwhile, the geometry of innovation\u2014the respective role of public and private players in driving technological progress\u2014has changed since the Cold War, in ways that have not always yielded what the country needs. The rise of venture capital helped accelerate adoption and commercialization, but it did little to address higher-order scientific problems.\n\nThe reasons for Washington\u2019s reluctance to fund the science that serves as the foundation of innovation power are structural. Innovation requires risk and, at times, failure\u2014something politicians are loath to accept. Innovation can demand long-term investments, but the U.S. government operates on a single-year budget cycle and, at most, a two-year political cycle. Despite these obstacles, Silicon Valley (along with other hot spots in the United States) has still managed to encourage innovation. The American success story relies on a potent mix of inspiring ambition, startup-friendly legal and tax regimes, and a culture of openness that allows entrepreneurs and researchers to iterate and improve on new ideas.\n\n\nThe United States\u2019 outdated immigration system prevents too many talented people from coming.\nThat may not be enough, however. Government support has long played a critical role in jump-starting innovation in the United States, and research in technologies that seem outlandish now may prove critical in the not-too-distant future. In 2013, for example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency invested in messenger RNA vaccines, working with the biotech company Moderna, which would later develop and deliver a COVID-19 vaccine in record time. But such examples are rarer than they should be.\n\nCompetition with China demands a reenergizing of the interplay among the government, the private sector, and academia. Just as the Cold War led to the creation of the National Security Council, today\u2019s tech-fueled competition should spur a rethinking of existing policymaking structures. As the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (which I chaired) recommended, a new \u201ctechnology competitiveness council,\u201d inspired by the NSC, could help coordinate action among private actors and develop a national plan to advance crucial emerging technologies. In a promising sign, Congress appears to have recognized the need for decisive support. In 2022, in a bipartisan vote, it passed the CHIPS and Science Act, which directs $200 billion in funding for scientific R & D over the next ten years.\n\nINVESTING IN THE FUTURE\nAs part of its effort to ensure that it remains an innovation superpower, the United States will need to invest billions of dollars in key areas of technological competition. In semiconductors, perhaps the most vital technology today, the U.S. government should redouble its efforts to onshore and \u201cfriend shore\u201d supply chains, relocating them to the United States or friendly countries. In renewable energy, it should fund R & D for microelectronics, stockpile the rare-earth minerals (such as lithium and cobalt) needed for batteries and electric vehicles, and invest in new technologies that can replace lithium-ion batteries and offset China\u2019s resource dominance. Meanwhile, the rollout of 5G in the United States has been slow, in part because government agencies\u2014most notably, the Department of Defense\u2014control most of the high-frequency radio spectrum that 5G uses. To catch up with China, the Pentagon should open up more of the spectrum to private actors.\n\nThe United States will need to invest in all parts of the innovation cycle, funding not just basic research but also commercialization. Meaningful innovation requires both invention and implementation, the ability to execute and commercialize new inventions at scale. This is often the main stumbling block. Research in electric cars, for example, helped General Motors bring its first model onto the market in 1996, but it took two more decades before Tesla mass-produced a commercially viable model. Every new technology, from AI to quantum computing to synthetic biology, must be pursued with the clear goal of commercialization.\n\nIn addition to directly investing in the technologies that fuel innovation power, the United States must invest in the input that lies at the core of innovation: talent. The United States boasts the world\u2019s top startups, incumbent companies, and universities, all of which attract the best and the brightest from around the world. Yet too many talented people are prevented from coming to the United States by its outdated immigration system. Instead of creating an easy path to a green card for foreigners who earn STEM degrees from American schools, the current system makes it needlessly difficult for top graduates to contribute to the U.S. economy.\n\nThe United States has an asymmetric advantage when it comes to employing highly skilled immigrants, and its enviable living standards and abundant opportunities explain why the country has attracted most of the world\u2019s brightest AI minds. More than half of all AI researchers working in the United States hail from abroad, and the demand for AI talent still far exceeds supply. If the United States closes its doors to talented immigrants, it risks losing its innovative edge. Just as the Manhattan Project was led in large part by refugees and \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Europe, the next American technological breakthrough will almost certainly rely on immigrants. \n\nTHE BEST DEFENSE\nAs part of its efforts to translate innovation into hard power, the United States must fundamentally rethink some of its defense policies. During the Cold War, the country designed various \u201coffset\u201d strategies to counterbalance Soviet numerical superiority through military strategy and technological innovations. Today, Washington needs what the Special Competitive Studies Project has called an \u201cOffset-X\u201d strategy, a competitive approach through which the United States can maintain technological and military superiority.\n\nGiven how much modern militaries and economies rely on digital infrastructure, any future great-power war is likely to start with a cyberstrike. The United States\u2019 cyberdefenses, therefore, need a response time faster than humans\u2019 reaction time. Having faced constant cyberattacks even in peacetime, the United States should armor itself with redundancy, creating backup systems and alternative paths for data flows.\n\nWhat starts in cyberspace could easily escalate into the physical realm, and there, too, the United States will need to meet new challenges. To counter possible swarm drone attacks, it must invest in defensive artillery and missile systems. To improve battlefield awareness, the U.S. military should focus on deploying a network of inexpensive sensors powered by AI to monitor contested areas, an approach that is often more effective than a single, exquisitely crafted system. As human intelligence becomes harder to obtain, the United States must increasingly rely on the largest constellation of sensors of any country, ranging from undersea to outer space. It will also need to focus more on open-source intelligence, given that most of the world\u2019s data today is publicly available. Without this capability, the United States risks being surprised by its intelligence failures.\n\n\nIn the contest of the century\u2014the U.S. rivalry with China\u2014the deciding factor will be innovation power.\nWhen it comes to actual fighting, military units should be networked and decentralized to better outmaneuver opponents. Facing adversaries with rigid military hierarchies, the United States could gain an advantage by using smaller, more connected units whose members are adept at network-based decision-making, employing the tools of artificial intelligence to their advantage. For example, a single unit could bring together capabilities in intelligence collection, long-range missile attacks, and electronic warfare. The Pentagon needs to provide battlefield commanders with all the best information and allow them to make the best choices on the ground.\n\nThe U.S. military must also learn to integrate new technologies into its procurement process, battle plans, and warfighting. In the four years that I chaired the Defense Innovation Board, I was astounded by how difficult this was to do. A major bottleneck is the Pentagon\u2019s burdensome procurement process: major weapons systems take more than ten years to design, develop, and deploy. The Department of Defense should look for inspiration in the way the tech industry designs products. It should build missiles the way companies now build electric cars, using a design studio to develop and simulate software, looking for innovations ten times as fast and as cost-effective as current processes. The current procurement system is especially ill suited for a future in which software primacy proves decisive on the battlefield.\n\nThe United States spends four times as much as any other country to procure military systems, but price is a poor metric for judging innovation power. In April 2022, Ukrainian forces fired two Neptune missiles at the Moskva, a 600-foot Russian warship, sinking the vessel. The ship cost $750 million; the missiles, $500,000 apiece. Likewise, China\u2019s state-of-the-art hypersonic antiship missile, the YJ-21, could someday sink a $10 billion U.S. aircraft carrier. The U.S. government should think twice before committing another $10 billion and ten years to such a vessel. It often makes more sense to buy many low-cost items instead of investing in a few high-ticket prestige projects.\n\nPLAYING TO WIN\nIn the contest of the century\u2014the U.S. rivalry with China\u2014the deciding factor will be innovation power. Technological advances in the next five to ten years will determine which country gains the upper hand in this world-shaping competition. The challenge for the United States, however, is that government officials are incentivized to avoid risk and focus on the short term, leaving the country to chronically underinvest in the technologies of the future.\n\nIf necessity is the mother of invention, war is the midwife of innovation. Speaking to Ukrainians on a visit to Kyiv in the fall of 2022, I heard from many that the first months of the war were the most productive of their lives. The United States\u2019 last truly global war\u2014World War II\u2014led to the widespread adoption of penicillin, a revolution in nuclear technology, and a breakthrough in computer science. Now, the United States must innovate in peacetime, faster than ever before. By failing to do so, it is eroding its ability to deter\u2014and, if necessary, to fight and win\u2014the next war.\n\nThe alternative could be disastrous. Hypersonic missiles could leave the United States defenseless, and cyberattacks could cripple the country\u2019s electric grid. Perhaps even more important, the warfare of the future will target individuals in completely new ways: authoritarian states such as China and Russia may be able to collect individual data on Americans\u2019 shopping habits, location, and even DNA profiles, allowing for tailor-made disinformation campaigns and even targeted biological attacks and assassinations. To avert these horrors, the United States needs to make sure it remains ahead of its technological competitors.\n\nThe principles that have defined life in the United States\u2014freedom, capitalism, individual effort\u2014were the right ones for the past and remain so for the future. These basic values lie at the foundation of an innovation ecosystem that is still the envy of the world. They have enabled breakthroughs that have transformed everyday life around the world. The United States started the innovation race in pole position, but it cannot rest assured it will remain there.

{"text":"GE, GM, Boeing and Ford among companies listing China risk\nGeopolitical risk is a top concern for supply chains, study says\nCompanies including General Electric Co., Boeing Co., and Nike Inc. are wading through a mounting pile of concerns about their China-linked supply chains as geopolitical troubles brew and pressure to cut ties ramps up from the US government and investors.\n\nGeopolitical risk is rising as recent tensions between China and Taiwan add to companies\u2019 long lists of supply chain worries. There\u2019s a hangover from the Covid pandemic and shutdowns in China, tariffs on Chinese imports, sanctions on Chinese businesses, and a new US human rights law targeting forced labor in China, lawyers and supply chain experts say. And it\u2019s all happening as the Biden administration and Congress\u2014continually hawkish on China as an economic and national security threat\u2014hope to incentivize manufacturing closer to home.\n\nGE, Boeing, and automakers General Motors Co, and Ford Motor Co. are among the companies disclosing in financial filings how US-China frictions pose business risks. There\u2019s also pressure from investors. Walt Disney Co., Apple Inc, Starbucks Corp. and Boeing faced China-related shareholder proposals in recent weeks, asking the companies to weigh the reputational risk of doing business in the country.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mountain of risk that continues to get larger,\u201d said Lisa Anderson, a supply chain expert at LMA Consulting.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the newly-formed Select Committee on China sent warning shots to companies including Nike and Adidas AG earlier in May, pressing them on how they avoid using goods made with forced labor in China. The new bipartisan committee has promised to \u201crestore supply chains and end critical economic dependencies on China.\u201d\n\nSome companies are shifting where they make their products or source their materials. Apple, for example, is planning to move more of its iPhone production from China to India. But the process of revamping supply chains that took years or even decades to build can be both time consuming and costly, lawyers and consultants say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very challenging because, first of all, supply chains are created over many years,\u201d said Carl Valenstein, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. \u201cPeople think you can easily change your supply chain\u2014you can\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\n\u2018Unique Risks\u2019\nCompanies with significant business tied to China are putting investors on notice about the continued or increasing risks.\n\nGE\u2019s April quarterly 10-Q filing noted the risks imposed by \u201can escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions between the US and China or other countries, and related impacts on our businesses\u2019 global supply chains and strategies.\u201d Boeing, in an April 10-Q filing, said that \u201cthe current state of US-China relations remains an ongoing watch item,\u201d noting the dueling US and China import tariffs on airplane parts and components.\n\nThe automotive industry, especially, is on alert. Ford said in a February filing that \u201cChina presents unique risks to US automakers due to the strain in US-China relations, China\u2019s unique regulatory landscape, and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain.\u201d And GM pointed out in its January annual report that \u201ccontinued US-China trade tensions\u201d among other factors could impact its business.\n\nBoeing declined to comment. GM and GE didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment. A Ford spokesperson downplayed the unique risk posed by the company\u2019s China operations\u2014at least in comparison to other risks that investors need to know about.\n\n\u201cFederal law requires us to disclose material factors\u2014including everything from pandemic conditions to geopolitical factors\u2014that could introduce risk to our business operations,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt is common\u2014and expected\u2014for multinational companies to do this, including other global automakers.\u201d\n\nA number of companies frequently reference the hit their supply chain\u2019s production took from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns in China.\n\n\u201cCovid made it quite brutally visible that having an undiversified supply chain meant losing market share at lightning speed,\u201d said Gregor St\u00fchler, CEO of supply chain AI platform Scoutbee.\n\nIntelligence Warning\nThen there\u2019s the specter of China potentially invading Taiwan, and the US sanctions that would surely follow.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big fear,\u201d Valenstein said, noting that an invasion of Taiwan would be far more disruptive on US supply chains than Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has been, because of how intertwined the US and Chinese economies are.\n\nThe US intelligence community has voiced its supply chain fears. The most recent annual threat assessment, published in February, laid out the US worries that China\u2019s dominance in the tech, semiconductor, battery, solar panel and pharmaceutical sectors \u201ccould pose a significant risk to US and Western manufacturing and consumer sectors if the government of China was able to adeptly leverage its dominance for political or economic gain.\u201d\n\nThe data back up just how many companies are mulling such concerns. A KPMG survey of 132 companies on Asian Pacific sourcing moves said 23% of supply chain shifts were prompted by geopolitical risk. The March report lists Vietnam, Taiwan, the US, Mexico and India among some of the top destinations for such shifts from China between 2018 and 2023.\n\n\u201cThe costs have become so significant that it\u2019s not a surprise to see efforts, slow though they may be, to shift away from China,\u201d said Ryan Fayhee, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed who previously worked at the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division.\n\nSupply chain experts say there\u2019s been an increase in clients mulling potential manufacturing or sourcing shifts, but much depends on the industry. The solar panel market has made a \u201cremarkable shift\u201d out of China, Valenstein said, but the life sciences industry \u201cis not going to abandon\u201d the Chinese market.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to boost US manufacturing, for example through incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act to encourage domestic sourcing of components and critical minerals for EV batteries. While China dominates the EV battery supply chain, Ford and Tesla have plans to build new battery plants in the US.\n\nFor many other companies, though, \u201ccutting China out of their supply chain is not realistic\u2014at least in the short or medium term,\u201d said Richard Mojica, a partner at Miller & Chevalier.\n\nNike, Adidas Pressed\nThere are also human rights concerns about sourcing materials in China. A new US human rights law targeting Chinese goods made with forced labor, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, assumes that any product made with goods even partially sourced from the Xinjiang region of China has been made with forced labor\u2014unless a company can prove otherwise.\n\n\u201cOne of the key concerns and challenges among numerous industries right now is the need to trace their supply chains and map them way back to the Nth degree,\u201d Mojica said, explaining that the broad swathe of government scrutiny is driving a lot of these assessments. \u201cThat is a humongous challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new law, which took effect in June, has caught some companies off guard. US Customs says on its website that it has denied 490 shipments into the country to date under the law; 291 of those were from apparel, footwear and textiles companies.\n\nLawmakers this month pressed Nike, Adidas, and Chinese-based shopping platforms Shein and Temu, questioning them in public letters about how they avoid using goods made with forced labor. The letter to Nike, for example, asks the retailer for a \u201cdetailed description\u201d of the steps it\u2019s taken since the UFLPA took effect\u2014to examine its supply chain, if its contractually obligated its garment suppliers to ensure that no materials from Xinjiang are used in clothes to be sold in the US, and what audit methods it uses to verify that suppliers in China are not exploiting Uyghurs.\n\nThe companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The lawmakers are warning businesses to make changes now: Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, encouraged companies at an April hearing to \u201cscour their supply chains.\u201d\n\n\nProxy Action\nShareholders have also pointed to forced labor concerns and the worsening US-China relationship during annual meetings.\n\nRecent resolutions at Apple, Disney, Starbucks, and Boeing were brought by the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative shareholder proponent. The group asked the companies to look into potential risks to their reputations and other areas of operating in China. While the proposals typically received less than 10% of support, Paul Chesser, who has presented the proposals for the group, said in an interview that he believes \u201cthis is an issue for which those on the left and right can come together.\u201d\n\nA March report on the 2023 proxy season from environmental, social and governance proponents strikes a similar bipartisan sentiment. The report from shareholder advocate As You Sow, partnered with the Sustainable Investments Institute and Proxy Impact, said concern about corporate ties to the Chinese Communist Party is \u201ca shared concern with progressive groups.\u201d\n\nCompanies have mainly argued that they already report on such risks. Boeing said in the proxy statement for its April annual meeting that \u201csingling out particular countries or groups of customers for scrutiny would be misleading to shareholders and potentially damage our relationships with customers, suppliers, and regulators.\u201d\n\nWhile at least some corporate boards are finding their China operations a growing area of concern and alerting investors, most companies still aren\u2019t completely ready to pull the plug, supply chain experts say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly movement but it\u2019s strategic and it can be piecemeal,\u201d Mojica said. \u201cThere\u2019s not this rush to get out of China.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Clara Hudson in Washington at chudson@bloombergindustry.com\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeff Harrington at jharrington@bloombergindustry.com; Michael Ferullo at mferullo@bloomberglaw.com\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Aug 30 (Reuters) - French telecom provider Iliad reported a more than 4% rise in half-year core profit on Wednesday, supported by gains across markets and the expansion of its activities in Italy.\n\nThe unlisted company, which operates in France, Italy and Poland, posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and after leases (EBITDAal) of 1.64 billion euros ($1.78 billion) for the first half of 2023, up from 1.58 billion a year earlier.\nIliad's performance makes it an outlier among industry peers, after French rivals Orange (ORAN.PA) and SFR, part of the Altice group (ATUS.N), recorded weaker earnings growth for the half-year period.\n\nIn an economic context \"full of uncertainties, caution is called for, but Iliad's development model is proving its robustness\", Chief Executive Thomas Raynaud said in a statement.\n\nTelecommunications companies across Europe have been hit by rising energy prices, infrastructure costs to deploy fibre and 5G coverage, and a slowdown in subscriber growth. This has led all Iliad's competitors on the French market to increase their rates.\n\nFree Mobile, Iliad's French service provider and largest branch in terms of revenue, earlier this year set a five-year price cap on its plans, an anti-inflation measure that was criticised as the price of add-ons was nonetheless increased.\n\nAsked about the cost of this measure during a press call, Raynaud described the price cap as an \"opportunity to lead the race in terms of market share gains\". He did not comment on the cost.\n\nRegarding Italy's recent decision to join U.S. fund KKR's bid for Telecom Italia's (TLIT.MI) grid, Raynaud said the move underlined a \"strong political will\" to deploy fibre across the country, to which Iliad contributes, adding the group was waiting for more details.\n\nThe group remains on the lookout for potential acquisitions in Italy after its 2022 Vodafone bid was rejected, he said.\n\n","labels":["financial_success"]}
{"text":"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Grocery delivery service Instacart on Friday said its core business turned profitable after making public its filing for a long-awaited stock market launch, while also disclosing an investment from PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O).\n\nSan Francisco-based Instacart, which filed confidentially for its initial public offering (IPO) in May 2022, said in the filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that PepsiCo had agreed to buy $175 million in preferred convertible stock.\n\nNorges Bank Investment Management, a division of Norges Bank, and entities affiliated with venture capital firms TCV, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and Valiant Capital Management have agreed to participate in the IPO as cornerstone investors, Instacart said.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, Instacart's revenue came in at $1.48 billion, up 31% from the same period last year. Advertising and other revenue surged 24% to $406 million. It reported net income of $242 million during the six-month period, compared to a $74 million loss a year earlier.\n\nInstacart's push to go public comes days after SoftBank Group-backed (9984.T) chip designer Arm Holdings disclosed the paperwork for its IPO filing.\n\nLike Arm and marketing automation firm Klaviyo, Instacart is expected to list its shares in September - part of a wave of high-profile names testing investor appetite for new stocks. The market for new listings has been subdued for most of the last two years due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the spike in interest rates.\n\n\nIf successful, the listings could revitalise the U.S. IPO market, which has already seen some green shoots this year on bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate policy could guide the economy to a \"soft landing.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to see more companies kick off their (IPO) process in 2024, which is when a healthy IPO market will return,\" said Mike Bellin, IPO services leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers U.S.\n\nThe fact that Instacart is generating a profit could also help it find favour among wary IPO investors, who since last year have stayed away from listings of loss-making startups, analysts said.\n\nLONG ROAD TO IPO\nInstacart's move to go public comes years after it first started making preparations for a stock market debut. Reuters reported in November 2020 that it hired Goldman Sachs to help lay the groundwork.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen, and Brandon Leonardo, Instacart brought in former Facebook executive Fidji Simo as its Chief Executive Officer and former Goldman Sachs technology banker Nick Giovanni as its Chief Financial Officer in 2021 as part of its preparations to go public.\n\nIn March 2021, Instacart added Snowflake (SNOW.N) CEO Frank Slootman, a software industry veteran behind some big IPOs, to its board.\n\nCustomers can order through the Instacart app, and an Instacart \"shopper\" delivers the product in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe company has also expanded its delivery business to non-grocery goods such as those from beauty product retailer Sephora, convenience store 7-Eleven and pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS.N).\n\nAccording to data by Euromonitor, the online grocery sector was set to be the largest source of growth for the U.S. food and beverage industry, adding nearly $100 billion in sales by 2027.\n\nThe company also sells software-as-a-service offerings targeted at retailers and charges fees for such offerings.\n\nIts core delivery business received a boost in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a surge in online orders. But as lockdown restrictions started easing from 2021, growth slowed down and market volatility forced the company to revise its valuation.\n\nIn December 2022, Instacart slashed its internal valuation to as low as $10 billion, 74% less than the $39 billion price tag in its funding round in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not expect our pandemic-accelerated growth rates to recur in future periods, our growth during this period helped establish a business with much greater scale and much higher gross profit,\u201d Instacart said in the filing, known as an S-1.\n\nInstacart had earlier planned to list in the fourth quarter of last year, but deferred those plans as a sell-off in technology stocks and the Fed's rate hikes caused a rout in equities.\n\nThe company filed for the IPO as \"Maplebear,\" the name under which it was incorporated.\n\nGoldman Sachs and J.P.Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering, Instacart said, adding that its shares would be listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"CART.\"","labels":["financial_success"]}
{"text":"THREATS\nNorth Korean hackers used polished LinkedIn profiles to target security researchers\nAs part of the shift in tactics, the hackers have deployed a range of new tools and social engineering tactics to lure their victims.\nBY\nAJ VICENS\nMARCH 10, 2023\n\nA North Korean flag flies above their embassy in Beijing on February 12, 2013. (Ed JONES \/ AFP)\nHackers believed to be working on behalf of North Korea have in recent years posed as recruiters and targeted workers in a variety of industries with offers of extravagant jobs at big-name firms with massive salaries. In the past, that campaign has mostly been carried out over email, but now researchers are seeing North Korean hackers shift their phishing attempts to LinkedIn and WhatsApp.\n\nBy first constructing convincing profiles on the career-focused social media platform LinkedIn, reaching out to their victims with phony job offers and convincing them to move the conversation over to WhatsApp, where they would be targeted with malware, North Korean hackers have crafted a sophisticated method for targeting computer security researchers, according to a two-part report released by Google\u2019s Mandiant on Thursday.\n\nMichael Barnhart, a principal analyst at Mandiant, describes this North Korean threat actor as \u201cone of the more skilled groups coming out of this closed off nation,\u201d and in targeting security researchers, the group deployed a range of new tools.\n\nThe group\u2019s activity \u2014 tracked as UNC2970 or TEMP.Hermit by Mandiant and included under the broader Lazarus umbrella by others \u2014 includes \u201can array of specially crafted LinkedIn accounts based on legitimate users\u201d that are \u201cwell designed and professionally curated to mimic the identities of the legitimate users in order to build rapport and increase the likelihood of conversation and interaction,\u201d Mandiant\u2019s researchers said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the attackers were successful in shifting the conversation from LinkedIn to WhatsApp, they would continue interacting with the target before sending a phishing payload disguised as a job description, the researchers said, primarily in the form of customized Microsoft Word documents embedded with macros that would pull malware a remote server. In at least one case, researchers said, the hackers \u201ccontinued interacting with a victim even after the phishing payload was executed and detected, asking for screenshots of the detection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe activity outlined here lends itself to a more espionage-oriented goal, whereas other elements within this group are strictly after crypto and revenue generation,\u201d Barnhart said in an email to CyberScoop. \u201cThis speaks to the size and priorities of this actor, which publicly aligns with the DPRK\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is widespread overlap of tooling and tactics across North Korean-aligned hacking groups, Mandiant considers TEMP.Hermit to be a distinct subset of activity under the control of the country\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau and focused on intelligence collection.\n\nMandiant\u2019s report notes that although previous campaigns focused largely on the defense, media and technology industries, this more recent effort targeted security researchers, possibly suggesting \u201ca shift in strategy or an expansion of its operations.\u201d\n\nEarlier reporting by cybersecurity firms \u2014 such as a campaign dubbed \u201cDream Job\u201d by ClearSky in 2022 \u2014 have documented how North Korean hacking groups have typically approached targets via email, allowing for a more direct delivery of customized phishing malware. But the evolution documented by Mandiant over the second half of 2022 suggests that email-based attacks are getting harder to pull off, a shift Barnhart suggest might be caused by the growing adoption of cloud infrastructure and endpoint detection and response software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nExample of one of the lure documents sent by North Korean-linked hackers (Mandiant)","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

It is vital for Diamond to continue carrying local games on its networks. Since its filing, it has already seen some teams leave its Bally Sports channels due to a breakdown in rights fees discussions.\n\nThe prospect of local game rights being up for grabs has attracted broadcast station owners \u2013 including Nexstar Media Group\n, Gray Television\n and E.W. Scripps Co\n. \u2013 looking to carry the games, CNBC previously reported. The Phoenix Suns recently exited a Bally Sports network for such a deal.\n\nBesides shedding its hefty debt load, Diamond is looking to reset some of its rights deals with teams to reflect so-called market rates.\n\nLast week, a lawyer on behalf of the NHL said the league was in constructive discussions with Diamond, but that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d ahead of the upcoming season.\n\nSinclair tension\nDuring the bankruptcy process so far, Diamond has faced numerous conflicts \u2013 including an ongoing battle with MLB over teams\u2019 streaming rights and rights fees that has led to Diamond dropping some teams from its Bally Sports channels and its recent lawsuit against parent company, Sinclair\n.\n\nOn Wednesday, Diamond unveiled the details behind the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2019, Sinclair acquired the portfolio of networks \u2013 previously known as Fox Sports \u2013 from Disney for $10.6 billion, a required divestiture that was part of Disney\u2019s buyout of Fox Corp.\u2019s 21st Century assets.\n\nDiamond\u2019s more than $8 billion debt load stems from the deal, which also imposed between $400 million to $650 million in debt payments, the company said in court papers.\n\nIn the few years since, Diamond\u2019s business, pay-TV providers and other cable channels have experienced accelerating deterioration in their business.\n\nDiamond is now alleging that the ownership of Sinclair only exacerbated its problems.\n\nIn court papers, the company said Sinclair has been \u201cmilking\u201d Diamond for more than $100 million annually in management fees since the acquisition, despite knowing the dire state of the business. On top of this, Diamond alleges Sinclair, in a \u201cnefarious strategy ... wrongfully caused Diamond to transfer more than $1.5 billion in cash and other consideration for the benefit of Sinclair.\u201d\n\nThis occurred as Diamond alleges Sinclair knew the RSN business was \u201ccareering toward bankruptcy, and it continued after Diamond was unquestionably insolvent.\u201d\n\n\u201cSinclair has been informed of a lawsuit filed by Diamond Sports Group in connection with their ongoing bankruptcy proceeding.

{"text":"RABAT, June 20 (Reuters) - Morocco's OCP plans to invest $7 billion in an ammonia plant using green hydrogen, produced from renewable fuel, it told Reuters, as one of the world's biggest phosphates and fertiliser companies seeks to increase output and meet low carbon goals.\n\nState-owned OCP is one of the biggest importers of ammonia, spending $2 billion on the raw material last year as the war in Ukraine pushed up global prices.\n\nThe war's impact on supplies also increased OCP's global significance and its renewables push is an important part of a Moroccan industrial strategy to reduce energy imports.\n\nTo offset supply problems, OCP has struck a deal to buy ammonia from North America this year, it said.\n\nLonger term, it plans to reinforce its domestic supply chain, including by building a plant in Tarfaya in southern Morocco.\n\nBy 2026, the plant would produce 200,000 tonnes of ammonia a year, increasing to 1 million tonnes by 2027 and 3 million tonnes by 2032, it said in an emailed answer to Reuters questions.\n\nIts plan to use hydrogen produced from solar-and-wind-powered electrolysis as a raw material to make ammonia is part of a $13 billion strategy the company announced in December to shift to renewable energy.\n\nMorocco has invested heavily in renewables, partly because it has lots of empty land, sun and wind and a long coastline, but also because it lacks oil or gas and has a difficult relationship with neighbouring hydrocarbons producer Algeria.\n\nThe government wants to raise renewable energy to 52% of installed power capacity from 38% by 2030 and is also pushing for an increase in desalination to help cities and agriculture cope with the impact of years of drought.\n\nState-owned OCP has said it plans to rely entirely on desalinated water for industrial operations by 2027 and it told Reuters it will launch tenders early next year to expand desalination capacity at Safi and Jorf Lasfar on the Atlantic.\n\nIts Tarfaya project involves a renewable-energy powered desalination plant with capacity of 60 million cubic meters a year to supply the industrial facilities.\n\nAFRICA EXPANSION\nLast year, higher prices allowed OCP to record revenues of $11.29 bln, up 40% from 2021, and net profit was $4.9 billion, up 38%. Profits have fallen this year because of lower prices, but OCP expects them to recover in the second half.\n\n\"We will ramp up our production to meet the incremental demand,\" said OCP, which has the world's biggest phosphate reserves and plans to increase fertiliser output capacity to 15 million tonnes this year and 20 million tonnes in 2027.\n\nThe company has promised to allocate 4 million tonnes of fertiliser production to the African market, where it has set up blending units and mapped soil composition across 30 million hectares to help produce customised fertilisers.\n\nOCP's investments in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, where fertiliser supply is crucial to economic development, mirror expansion by other Moroccan companies on the continent that has served to underpin increased diplomatic engagement.\n\nOCP told Reuters it would start production at its Nigeria fertilisers plant in late 2026 and in the same year launch a pre-production stage at its Ethiopia plant.","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a challenge by President Joe Biden's administration to the legality of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, putting on hold a deal that would shield its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits over their role in the country's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe justices paused bankruptcy proceedings concerning Purdue and its affiliates and said they would hold oral arguments in December in the administration's appeal of a lower court's ruling upholding the settlement. The Supreme Court's new term begins in October.\n\nPurdue's owners under the settlement would receive immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed by states, hospitals, people who had become addicted and others who have sued the Stamford, Connecticut-based company over its misleading marketing of the powerful pain medication OxyContin.\n\nIn a statement, Purdue said it was disappointed that the U.S. Trustee, the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog that filed the challenge at the Supreme Court, has been able to \"single-handedly delay billions of dollars in value that should be put to use for victim compensation, opioid crisis abatement for communities across the country and overdose rescue medicines.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the legality of our nearly universally supported plan of reorganization, and optimistic that the Supreme Court will agree,\" the company added.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nAt issue is whether U.S. bankruptcy law allows Purdue's restructuring to include legal protections for the members of the Sackler family, who have not filed for personal bankruptcy.\n\nPurdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 to address its debts, nearly all of which stemmed from thousands of lawsuits alleging that OxyContin helped kickstart an opioid epidemic that has caused more than 500,000 U.S. overdose deaths over two decades.\n\nPurdue estimates that its bankruptcy settlement, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in 2021, would provide $10 billion in value to its creditors, including state and local governments, individual victims of addiction, hospitals, and others who have sued the company.\n\nThe Biden administration and eight states challenged the settlement, but all of the states dropped their opposition after the Sacklers agreed to contribute more to the settlement fund.\n\nIn May, the 2nd Circuit upheld the settlement, concluding that federal bankruptcy law allows legal protections for non-bankrupt parties like the Sacklers in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit ruled that the legal claims against Purdue were inextricably linked to claims against its owners, and that allowing lawsuits to continue targeting the Sacklers would undermine Purdue's efforts to reach a bankruptcy settlement.\n\nMembers of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing but expressed regret that OxyContin \"unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.\" They said in May that the bankruptcy settlement would provide \"substantial resources for people and communities in need.\"\n\nIn a court filing, the administration told the Supreme Court that Purdue's settlement is an abuse of bankruptcy protections meant for debtors in \"financial distress,\" not people like the Sacklers. According to the administration, Sackler family members withdrew $11 billion from Purdue before agreeing to contribute $6 billion to its opioid settlement.\n\nMany other stakeholders have responded in opposition to the administration's request to halt the settlement.\n\nA group comprising more than 60,000 people who have filed personal injury claims stemming from their exposure to Purdue opioid products told the Supreme Court they support the settlement, including legal immunity for members of the Sackler family.\n\n\"Regardless of how one feels about the role of the Sackler family in the creation and escalation of the opioid crisis,\" the group told the justices, \"the fact remains that the billions of dollars in abatement and victim compensation funds hinge on confirmation and consummation of the existing plan.\"","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Labor shortages are plaguing high-stakes sectors like law enforcement, health care and aviation.\n\nWhy it matters: Understaffing in some industries can have dire consequences for public health and safety \u2014 for example, a shortage of air traffic controllers has led to increase in near-miss airplane collisions, the New York Times recently reported.\n\nAt the same time, a lack of available workers in AI and manufacturing threatens to slow productivity and growth in areas where the U.S. is otherwise poised for huge leaps forward.\nThat's a problem not just for companies in those sectors, but for the broader economy.\n\nSchools across the country are understaffed, without enough teachers, bus drivers, or social workers.\nThe child care industry is also dealing with a shortage of available workers. Parents often either can't find care or can't afford it, which can cause them to stay on the sidelines of the labor force \u2014 making the worker shortage that much worse.\nPolice departments are also struggling to hire.\n\nSo are prisons \u2014 21% of correctional officer positions were unstaffed in federal prisons, according to a March report. A staffing shortage throughout the Bureau of Prisons is increasing incidents of violence and leading to more health issues for prisoners.\nHow it works: Americans are getting older, and there are fewer younger people of working age. Add to that a tight labor market \u2014 unemployment in the U.S. is very low \u2014 and there simply aren't enough workers in the U.S. to meet demand.\n\nSome of these high-stakes shortages are about wages. Government jobs, like teaching and law enforcement, typically can't raise pay high enough to compete with better-paying private sector jobs.\nSome of them are about working conditions: Employers trying to fill in-person, high-stress roles are competing with jobs that offer more flexibility, including remote options.\nAnd some of them are about skills: There are only so many people with a ton of expertise creating AI programs, for example. That's the problem in nursing, too.\n\nWhat we're watching: For workers, this isn't a crisis. A tight labor market means higher pay, better benefits and more congenial employers.\n\nUPS likely wouldn't have given such a generous contract to its unionized workforce \u2014 with some drivers earning $170,000 a year \u2014 if not for the tight labor market.\nPlenty of employers have figured out ways to adjust to this new normal \u2014 particularly in industries like retail and restaurants.\n\nThey've raised pay significantly, are relying more on automation (think self-checkouts gaining popularity), or cut their hours, or have made it work with some combination of those tactics.\nBut not every sector can take these steps. A lot of employers can raise wages and attract what workers are available, but the sectors facing these high-stakes shortages don't necessarily have that option.\nThe bottom line: Absent a surge in immigration, a surprise flood of sidelined women into the workforce, or a recession that drives down demand for employees, demographic changes mean that labor shortages will likely stick around.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"Aside from the record death toll from the Ebola outbreak in Africa, businesses around the globe will be affected by the pandemic, with the mining, agricultural and energy sectors most at risk of having their businesses disrupted.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even companies that don\u2019t have operations in the affected areas might have suppliers there who have to shut down, making disruption of transportation and supply networks a potential problem for many other organizations.\n\nThe outbreak that began in Guinea and spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria had claimed more than 1,100 lives by the end of last week, prompting quarantines, flight cancellations and business disruptions.\n\n\u201cFrom a corporate risk management perspective, the issue is usually how to reduce illness and avoid business disruption,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, London-based head of population risk and data analytics research and development at Swiss Re Ltd.\n\nJohn Rose, Annapolis, Maryland-based chief operating officer of risk management information and consulting firm iJET International Inc., said travel and logistical networks are particularly sensitive to disruption by a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn area impacted by Ebola, you are seeing a serious reduction in air traffic,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cNo airline is going to fly a wide body jet to Africa if only nine passengers are aboard, so you have to have a plan B to move your assets around.\u201d\n\nQuarantines and border closings also affect employees and supply chains, said Kimberly Hale, a senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Chicago.\n\n\n\u201cCompanies need to keep in mind that if they are sending people to affected regions, borders can close at the drop of a hat,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nMining, agricultural and energy companies tend to have large operations in the African nations, so they now are bearing the brunt of the Ebola pandemic.\n\nFor example, Luxembourg-based steelmaker and mining firm ArcelorMittal S.A. last week said contractors working on expanding an iron ore mining site in Liberia had declared force majeure and were moving workers out of the country, shutting the project down.\n\nIn a statement, ArcelorMittal said it had taken steps to protect employees and operations, including providing thermoflash scanners to test employees and visitors for fevers at all its Liberia locations, personal protective equipment to hospitals and clinics, and training to health care workers and employees.\n\nJason Jarrett, Vancouver, British Columbia-based chief adviser for global business resilience, global security with Rio Tinto Group, said the London-based mining company, which has extensive operations in Guinea, put in place appropriate steps to minimize the risks when the Ebola outbreak was first detected in March.\n\nThe company enhanced medical support for its people, Mr. Jarrett said, noting that all Rio Tinto staff in Guinea receive regular briefings with the latest medical advice and those visiting are fully briefed on arrival. Rio Tinto is also providing sanitation supplies such as soap and chlorine to the communities in which its people live and work.\n\n\u201cTo support the work of the Government of Guinea and Doctors Without Borders in fighting the disease, we are distributing prevention kits, organizing public awareness campaigns and providing sanitation equipment such as shovels, rakes and refuse bins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also constructed some latrines in one of the main towns to help improve hygiene.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Jarrett said that while Rio Tinto has not stopped the movement of its people in, out or around Guinea, it is ensuring that travel is only for essential purposes.\n\nChris Baudouin, Chicago-based CEO of the Aon Global Client Network, said an aggressive employee safety approach is warranted.\n\n\u201cA lot of our clients are mining operations, which tend to have assets in remote areas and limited access to health care and transportation,\u201d Mr. Baudouin said. \u201cSo they tend to err on the side on caution, especially if airlines are shutting down flights.\u201d\n\nTo remain abreast of the situation, Susan Morton, senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Boston, said it\u2019s important for businesses to have pandemic, crisis response and business continuity plans in place, and closely follow guidance from organizations such as the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere also are also dedicated, real-time third-party risk monitoring services available.\n\nMichael Kiewski, Chicago-based director of Aon\u2019s Crisis Operations Center, said his staff provides risk managers with real-time information from the company\u2019s crisis centers in Chicago and South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are taking open information from media and social media, analyzing it and sending it out to our risk manager clients,\u201d Mr. Kiewski said. \u201cWe are watching which airlines cancel flights and which countries are shutting down borders.\u201d\n\nCompanies with workers within the affected areas also face pressure from workers\u2019 families and adverse media attention that can tarnish their corporate reputation.\n\n\u201cStranding employees exposes you to lawsuits,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real risk.\u201d\n\nCompanies that do extract employees from affected areas of Africa still need to bear in mend Ebola\u2019s lengthy incubation period and plan accordingly. \u201cYou can leave Sierra Leone or Guinea and be perfectly fine and three weeks later come down with it,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nIndeed, to reduce the risk of transmission, Mr. Jarrett said Rio Tinto has asked workers who have visited the highest-risk areas to stay at home up to 21 days before returning to work.\n\nGeoff Taylor, London-based executive director at Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. said the pandemic highlights the need for companies to focus on supply chain resiliency.\n\n\u201cYou might be able to withstand the loss of one factory, but what if you lose a key port or have an entire country subject quarantines or sanctions?\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have single-source suppliers or several concentrated in a certain region, it is good to contemplate what your options are.\u201d","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"The country's top two cosmetics firms \u2015 AmorePacific and LG Household & Health Care (LG H&H) \u2015 are struggling to reduce their reliance on China as their sales in other regions including North America are not enough to offset falling sales in the world's second-largest economy, according to company officials Wednesday.\n\nThe two companies have been striving to spread out their global sales, which had been concentrated mainly in the Chinese market until 2021.\n\nAmorePacific's sales in China had accounted for nearly 70 percent of its total revenue until 2021. The cosmetics giant's sales skyrocketed when the two countries had better relations. However, due to geopolitical issues and the COVID-19 pandemic, AmorePacific's sales in China plunged, leading it to start expanding its business in the U.S. so as to cut its reliance on China as of last year.\n\n\"AmorePacific is not choosing the U.S. market over China. The Chinese market is still important for us and all other cosmetics firms in the world,\" an AmorePacific official said. \"China is the second-largest cosmetics market in the world after the U.S. and it has narrowed the gap very much recently. We are targeting both as well as other markets such as Japan and ASEAN.\"\n\nAmorePacific's sales in the first quarter of this year reached 913.6 billion won ($693.1 million), down 21.6 percent year-on-year. Its operating profit also plunged 59.3 percent from 157.9 billion won to 64.3 billion won in the same period.\n\nAs the company's business deteriorated in China, its sales in Asia also fell 24.7 percent year-on-year to 275.2 billion won in the first quarter of this year. Its skyrocketing sales in North America, which soared 80.4 percent in the same period to 62.8 billion from 34.8 billion won, was not enough help.\n\nThe situation is no different for LG H&H.\n\nLG H&H's sales between January and March increased year-on-year by 0.3 percent to 701.5 billion won from 699.6 billion won, but its operating profit decreased 11.6 percent to 61.2 billion won from 69 billion won.\n\nThe company's sales and operating profit in China declined by 17.4 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively.\n\n\"The answer is to focus on making cosmetics brands that global consumers patronize, regardless of political issues or economic slumps. We will strengthen our business competitiveness in the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia while continuing to improve our performance in China,\" an LG H&H official said.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
