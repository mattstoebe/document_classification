{"text":"Amidst a decline in foreign funding, China's banking and corporate elite have increasingly turned to domestic capital sources.\nAn intriguing approach to accessing these funds has surfaced, aptly dubbed \"throwing eggs,\" a term that refers to Guandan, a card game reminiscent of poker.\nThis interest was piqued by the game's popularity among affluent local government officials in the eastern provinces.\nChina's bankers and business executives have become increasingly reliant on domestic capital in recent years as foreign funding has dried up, but a popular way to unlock that cash may very well involve \"throwing eggs\".\n\nThe term refers to Guandan, a poker-like card game that has been around for decades, but has gained fresh life among venture capitalists a few years ago as they awoke to its popularity among wealthy local government officials in eastern regions.\n\n\"Officials like this game, so we play along,\" said Yang Yiming, an investment banker whose job involves canvassing government funding for projects linked to semiconductors and defence.\n\n\nThe growing interest in business circles has spawned a craze for the game nationwide, driven partly by financial constraints stemming from souring ties with China's biggest trade partner, the United States.\n\nThis month U.S. President Joe Biden barred some investment in semiconductors and set controls on other sensitive sectors, aiming to curb trade and funding that could give rival Beijing an edge in technology.\n\nTotal U.S.-based venture-capital investment in China plummeted to $9.7 billion last year from $32.9 billion in 2021, PitchBook data shows.\n\nDomestic private capital has also dwindled as President Xi Jinping signalled his preference for a bigger state presence in the economy by launching crackdowns over the last few years in areas from technology to real estate and private tutoring.\n\nAs investment prospects darken, financiers increasingly view the game as a way to build 'guanxi' or connections with officials who hold the purse strings on local projects, especially those overseas investors might consider too risky.\n\n\"In finance, information is currency,\" said Yang, for whom a game of guandan has become a standard gambit before wining and dining local officials.\n\n\n\"During a game which can stretch for hours, we are bound to chit-chat, and sometimes useful information gets passed around after people feel comfortable and trust you.\"\n\nYu Longze, a broker based in Beijing, said his boss this month ordered all staff to learn the game.\n\nLike bridge, the classic staple, the game is played among four players paired up in teams. Using two decks, players must throw down poker and other special card combinations to clear their hands before opponents.\n\n\"From observing someone's playing style, you can tell if he is smart, aggressive or a team player. This can help you decide if you want him as a business partner,\" said a businessman surnamed Huang, who runs a private clubhouse where the game has become a favourite pastime of officials and company executives.\n\nBut not everyone treats guandan as a business tool.\n\nMany players say they simply enjoy the mental stimulation from a game that is cheap, convenient to play and allows them to socialise - aspects that, taken together, explain its appeal to all walks of life.\n\nCustomers ranged from retired people to young professionals seeking to build new social ties, said Hua Min, who this year opened the first bar dedicated to hosting guandan games in Beijing, the capital.\n\nLi Keshu, a lawyer, said playing with his friends in a park helped get through the social isolation and economic frustration of the COVID-19 years, when China threw up strict barriers against infection.\n\n\"It's cost-free. Unlike 'Texas Hold'em' or mahjong, this game doesn't need to be played with money to be fun. On the contrary, money spoils the friendship and the game.\"\n\nWhile the players Reuters spoke to said they do not gamble, Chinese officials have been censured in the past for receiving bribes through the playing of card games or the traditional tile pastime of mahjong.\n\nIn April, the ruling Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog censured one of its officials in the eastern province of Anhui for playing guandan during a training course, among other misdeeds.\n\nIn a sign that Beijing is not perturbed by the growing interest in the game, however, China's national sports authority has organised the first nationwide guandan competition this year.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","investments"]}

In some cases, corporations have drawn the ire of conservative customers for marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or criticizing laws targeting them \u2014 only to face backlash from more liberal shoppers for attempts to appease those who spurned a brand.\n\nBoycotts usually have little effect on a company\u2019s bottom line, according to experts who have tracked them. The backlash against Bud Light has hit particularly hard because there are similar substitutes for the light lager, constant media coverage has emboldened the boycotters, and the company has not put forth a unified strategy, said Anson Frericks, who spent more than a decade as president of sales and distribution at Anheuser-Busch.\n\nFor companies such as Target and Disney, it is unclear if boycotts will hit sales. Even if companies take no financial damage from the backlash, the increasingly aggressive resistance to LGBTQ+ marketing has jeopardized corporate-inclusion efforts that have become commonplace in recent years.\n\nThe backlash wave across the country, which has disproportionately targeted transgender people, has even weighed on large companies with more liberal reputations.

{"text":"Key takeaways\nApple stock prices fell some 27% in 2022.\nProduction problems in Chinese factories are putting downward pressure on stock prices.\nApple hit a $3 trillion valuation in January 2022. Since then, its valuation has fallen to less than $2 trillion.\nIn the last year, Apple stock has taken a tumble. Among the main problems causing the fall in stock prices are production issues that have plagued the company in recent months.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the production problems facing Apple.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening?\nIn 2022, Apple stock prices fell by around 27%. The significant drop took a big bite out of Apple\u2019s valuation. The company briefly hit a $3 trillion valuation early in 2022. But since then, Apple\u2019s value fell to just under $2 trillion before edging back up to the $2 trillion mark a day later.\n\nPROMOTED\n\n\nOf course, that still makes Apple a major company. In fact, it\u2019s currently the largest publicly-traded company in the world. However, falling stock prices at this large company are obviously still cause for concern among investors.\n\nThe tumultuous economic climate isn\u2019t doing Apple any favors. After all, most companies are seeing their stock prices take a hit as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and high inflation detracts from consumers\u2019 purchasing power. But many are pointing to Apple\u2019s production problems as the root cause of falling stock prices.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\nByAmy DaniseEditor\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\nByAmy DaniseEditor\nProduction problems\nWithout a product to sell, Apple cannot continue putting up impressive revenue numbers.

In the midst of country-wide protests, the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou has been unable to meet its production goals, in part due to worker unrest over issues of payment. Since this factory is where Apple produces the most iPhones, there has been a shortfall of the product.\n\nAccording to some reports, Apple might have a shortfall of six million iPhone Pro units on its hands. With a shortage of iPhones, some investors expect the company to report less revenue for the year. Fear of lower revenue is one common reason for a drop in stock price.\n\nRerouting the supply chain\nWith Foxconn producing around 70% of iPhones, Apple is relatively reliant on the Zhengzhou factory to meet its sales goals. After all, Apple can\u2019t earn money without selling its products to consumers.\n\nProtests across China have pushed back the timeline of iPhone production. And, of course, the company isn\u2019t thrilled about the situation. After months of protests, Apple is reportedly accelerating plans to move its production to other countries.\n\nReports that the company was looking to move its manufacturing outside of China surfaced in May 2022. But since then, the significant production delays and continued protests across China seem to have pushed Apple into action.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Apple is looking to shift production into countries like India and Vietnam. The move will distance Apple from the fallout of the Foxconn protests. Although details are sparse, some sources have reported that Apple may move up to 45% of iPhone production to factories in India.\n\nBut the reality of the situation is that Apple cannot wave a magic wand and seamlessly move production to another country. It may take years and billions of dollars to move iPhone production out of China.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest companies, Apple certainly has the resources to make the move. But the cost of moving might be too painful for some investors, which could lead to further drops in the stock price.\n\nImpressive revenue\nDespite the production problems and bumpy economic times, Apple is still putting up very impressive numbers. On October 27, Apple announced revenue of $90.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a record number.\n\nWith revenue up 8% from the same time last year, Apple\u2019s impressive numbers are a saving grace in the face of their production issues. The high revenue indicates that demand for Apple products is still incredibly strong.\n\nAs the company works to recalibrate its supply chain, strong customer demand will make the changes less painful. After all, demand for products outpacing supply isn\u2019t the worst problem for a company to have. Apple now faces the challenge of finding a way to keep up with the intense demand for its products.\n\nHow to invest in tech\nThe tech industry has faced many problems this past year. In addition to a wave of white-collar layoffs across the industry, many big tech companies have seen their stock prices go on a rollercoaster ride.\n\nAs an investor, it\u2019s challenging to optimize your portfolio in times of rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears. Even the largest company, Apple, is not immune to our current economic and geopolitical issues. And constantly monitoring the markets for changes isn\u2019t something every investor has the time or desire to do.\n\nOne way to streamline your portfolio management is to work with Q.ai\u2019s Investment Kits.

It is the latest entrant in the race to develop the first zero-emission vessels with a focus on the offshore sector and the potential of using power at the wind farms to charge the ships.\n\nIn their application for the UK\u2019s Zero Emission Vessel Infrastructure (ZEVI) competition, the coalition points to the strong opportunities in the segment to support offshore wind operations. With the UK calling for 40 GW offshore wind energy in additional offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 expanding on the more than 10 GW already in operation, the group estimated that between 62 and 149 vessels will be required. They highlighted that all the UK-operating SOVs have so far been built aboard.\n\nThey are proposing a 295-foot vessel that would be primarily powered by electricity and batteries and have dual-fuel methanol-powered engines as backup. The ship will be ready for offshore charging and can recharge its batteries at night. \n\nThey expect that it will be possible to operate a two-week cycle onsite at an offshore wind farm emissions-free. Near shore the vessel will operate solely on battery power and also while onsite. For the long transits between the shore homeports and the farms, the vessel will use its engines and with methanol fuel, it would be possible to still reduce emissions by 90 percent versus fossil fuel operations. They noted in the application if offshore charging is not available, the vessel would use its methanol engines to recharge its batteries and would still achieve a 50 percent reduction in emissions compared to a conventional SOV.\n\nDNV, which is one of the members of the coalition notes, \u201cThe number of fully electric and hybrid vessels will surge over the next few years, and continuing development on these technologies will be a key part of the maritime industry\u2019s transition to a zero-carbon future.\u201d\n\nBibby, which is leading the effort notes the vessel will be a natural progression in its decarbonization effort and the first new vessel for Bibby Marine in five years. \n\nIt was one of five projects that was announced today at London International Shipping Week as a winner in the UK Government\u2019s competition designed to support the development of new zero-emission maritime technologies. Under the rules of the competition, the vessel needs to be in service by 2025.  \n\nThey are estimating a cost of $37.5 million for the project with the UK government awarding them $25 million in funding. The project participants include Bibby Marine, Port of Aberdeen, Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, Kongsberg, DNV, Shell, and Liverpool John Moores University.\n\nIn the previous rounds of the funding competition, the UK has also awarded support to projects seeking to develop the technology required to provide offshore recharging capabilities. It has been highlighted that one of the challenges is the increasing distance from shore for the location of the wind farms, making onsite recharging critical. The UK projects are one of several looking at offshore recharging and creating vessels that are fully electric or use other technologies to be zero-emission ships.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Go Airlines (India) Ltd was granted bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, bolstering the country's fourth largest carrier's chances of getting back on its feet, but lessors have started mounting legal challenges to repossess planes.\n\nThe low-cost carrier, recently rebranded as Go First, was plunged into financial crisis this year, sparked by what it called \"faulty\" Pratt & Whitney engines that grounded about half its 54 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neos.\n\n\nThe U.S. engine maker, part of Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N), in a statement said Go First's allegations were \"without merit\".\n\nIn granting bankruptcy protection, the National Company Law Tribunal in New Delhi ordered a moratorium on Go First's assets and leases and appointed Abhilash Lal of Alvarez & Marsal as the interim resolution professional to take over management with immediate effect.\n\nThe resolution professional \"shall ensure that retrenchment of employees is not resorted to as a matter of course\", the tribunal's 41-page order said. Go First has a staff of around 7,000.\n\nThe bankruptcy move adds to headaches for lessors, which have filed requests with India's aviation regulator for the return of about 40 Go First planes after rental payments were missed.\n\nIndia made it easier for lessors to take back planes if airlines default on payments after joining an international treaty known as the Cape Town Convention in 2008. But bankruptcy protection supersedes lessors' repossession requests.\n\n\"The next step for lessors is to approach the appellate tribunal... It will be a prolonged legal battle,\" said Ajay Kumar, managing partner at India's KLA Legal, which represents Go First lessors including Jackson Square Aviation and Bank of China Aviation.\n\nHe added that Go First's woes will lead to higher lease premiums for Indian airlines.\n\nThat could prove to be a pain point for the sector at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is touting the country's emergence as an aviation powerhouse, with bigger rivals IndiGo (INGL.NS) and Tata Group's Air India expanding aggressively.\n\nGo First's lessors also include SMBC Aviation Capital and CDB Aviation's GY Aviation Leasing.\n\nThey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, according to a filing seen by Reuters, SBMC Aviation Capital has already approached India's appeals tribunal seeking to quash the bankruptcy order.\n\n'HISTORIC' DECISION\nGo First's voluntary pursuit of bankruptcy protection to renegotiate contracts and debt marks a first for an Indian airline. CEO Kaushik Khona, who was present as the order was read, hailed the tribunal's decision as \"historic\".\n\nThe airline, which had a 7% share of the world's third largest aviation market in March, has currently suspended all flights due to \"operational reasons\" and is not taking new bookings.\n\nReviving the carrier - one of the hardest hit worldwide by problems with Pratt & Whitney engines - will not be easy, said Abhirup Dasgupta, a partner at HAS Advocates who specialises in insolvency law but is not involved in Go First's proceedings.\n\nIt will require fresh funds, and lenders could be wary of investing, he said.\n\nGo First's bankruptcy filing lists Central Bank of India Ltd (CBI.NS), Bank of Baroda Ltd (BOB.NS), IDBI Bank Ltd (IDBI.NS), and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) among financial creditors which are owed 65.21 billion rupees ($798 million).\n\nThe airline's total liabilities stand at 114.63 billion Indian rupees, including dues to banks, financial institutions, vendors and aircraft lessors.\n\nIt's also not clear when the dispute with Pratt & Whitney will be resolved. Go First won an arbitration case in Singapore that ordered the U.S. firm to dispatch spare engines to the airline, and has since approached a Delaware Court to request that it be enforced.\n\nPratt & Whitney plans to oppose the move, a Delaware court filing showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Indian tribunal said the new resolution professional will take \"all necessary steps including the execution of the arbitral award\".\n\nIn its statement, Pratt & Whitney said it will vigorously defend itself against Go's claims, and was pursuing its own legal recourse.","labels":["financial_distress","supplychain"]}

{"text":"After years of battling supply chain issues, the automotive industry began to turn the corner in the first half of 2023, as many expected. However, Ford continues to battle various problems and shortages, along with a tight labor market, which is precisely why CEO Jim Farley previously stated that he believes supply chain problems are more of a permanent thing rather than a temporary storm that will pass at some point. While speaking at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference recently, Ford CFO John Lawler shed some more light on this topic by revealing that while supply chain issues are easing, they\u2019re still posing problems for The Blue Oval.\n\n\u201cYes. So, we are seeing disruptions due to supply availability, but it\u2019s much less than it was in the past,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cThere\u2019s still hiccups in chips, high demand chips that\u2019s happening. And the other thing that we\u2019re seeing is that as the water level overall is rising and production is coming back, we\u2019re seeing some of the suppliers that are not chip related having issues keeping up, ramping up to average per week volumes, max per week volumes. And so, we\u2019re working through some of those issues. And I think that\u2019s still part of the overhang from COVID and the fact that factories weren\u2019t running at that rate, maintenance wasn\u2019t necessarily where it should be, labor shortages, etc. But we\u2019re working through that, and it\u2019s getting much better.\u201d\n\nLawler\u2019s comments coincide with what we\u2019ve seen from Blue Oval production thus far this year, with many models seeing a sharp ramp up in that regard over the past few months. That list includes the the Ford Bronco Sport crossover, the Ford Transit van, the Ford Mustang Mach-E EV crossover, the refreshed Ford Escape crossover, and the Ford Maverick compact pickup.\n\nAs Ford Authority reported last week, even the Ford Bronco is facing no new supply constraints, which is big news for the in-demand SUV. However, some other red hot models \u2013 such as the Maverick Hybrid \u2013 remain constrained as demand still outweighs Ford\u2019s production capacity.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more on the state of the automotive supply chain soon, so be sure and subscribe to Ford Authority for 24\/7 Ford news coverage.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}

{"text":"\tIntel has taken an axe to its financial guidance for the first quarter of the year, as the collapse in PC sales and falling market share in its server chips division late last year proved even worse than Wall Street had been expecting.\n\nThe news sent its shares down more than 10 per cent at the start of trading on Friday.\n\nChief executive Pat Gelsinger blamed the latest step-down in Intel\u2019s financial prospects on \u201cpersistent macro headwinds\u201d and a much sharper chip inventory correction than it had been expecting. Intel did not issue financial guidance for the rest of the year but Gelsinger held out hope for a rebound in the second half of 2023 on an economic recovery in China and improving demand from large corporate and government customers.\n\nThe chipmaker said it expected revenue in the current quarter to fall to $10.5bn-$11.5bn, pointing to an accelerating decline in its business after a slump in the second half of 2022. At the midpoint, the company\u2019s revenue forecast was nearly $3bn below analysts\u2019 expectations and implied a 40 per cent tumble from a year before.\n\nThe sombre forecast came as Intel revealed that revenue had fallen 32 per cent in the final months of 2022 to $14bn, compared to expectations of $14.45bn. Adjusted earnings per share in the period were 10 cents, down from $1.15 a year before and below the 20 cents that Wall Street had forecast.\n\nThe latest figures also pointed to a sharper deterioration in Intel\u2019s finances, rekindling worries that it will be forced to slash its dividend payments. The company reported negative adjusted free cash flow for the year of $4.1bn. It had cut its forecast to a decline of $2-$4bn only three months before.\n\nDavid Zinsner, chief financial officer, said the cash flow had been affected by the delay of $3bn of subsidies that had been expected in 2022, and that Intel was \u201ccommitted to maintaining a competitive dividend\u201d.\n\nMost analysts had already cut their expectations for Intel in recent weeks, despite the positive reaction to the launch two weeks ago of a new generation of server chips designed to make up lost ground on arch-rival AMD.\n\nThough an important step in reducing the technology gap that had opened up between the two companies, most analysts predicted it would not be enough to win back market share, and that Intel\u2019s market position would continue to slip until it manages to catch up in advanced manufacturing with TSMC.\n\nIn the latest quarter, revenue from Intel\u2019s client computing group fell 36 per cent to $6.6bn, while sales in the data centre and AI division fell 33 per cent to $4.3bn.\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"As Mexico\u2019s Senate celebrated the passage of a bill designed to curb the power of the National Electoral Institute (INE), the non-partisan and independent agency that oversees elections, the country took another step backward toward its decades-long authoritarian past. Despite corruption, violence, and inequality, Mexico has functioned as an electoral democracy for nearly three decades \u2014 with political competition and a vibrant civil society. Much of that success is due to the INE.\n\nUnder President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a pugnacious and charismatic leader who swept to power in 2018, Mexico\u2019s independent institutions are slowly losing their ability to serve as a counterweight to the executive. The latest attack on the INE may be L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s most brazen of all. Yet, the U.S. government has cautiously maneuvered to avoid losing Mexico\u2019s cooperation on vital domestic issues, particularly immigration along the southern border. However, failing to speak out emphatically against Mexico\u2019s steady march back toward authoritarianism \u2014 despite recent rhetoric about \u201cstanding up for democracy\u201d \u2014 comes with its own risks. An unstable or even autocratic Mexico could exacerbate domestic challenges, including the fight against the opioid epidemic, turbocharged by fentanyl, and relegate President Joe Biden\u2019s seemingly firm commitment to democratic governance to mere rhetorical bluster.\n\nThe INE and the demise of Mexico\u2019s hegemonic-party autocracy\nFor much of the 20th century, Mexico operated as a hegemonic-party autocracy with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) at the helm. In this system, elections were held regularly to deter dissent by party elites, ensure the controlled rotation of power, and publicly signal overwhelming support for the PRI.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the economic and political dynamics of Mexico had changed, making the PRI\u2019s grip on power less secure. The 1988 elections \u2014 the first serious electoral competition in Mexico \u2014 were marred by widespread fraud. Although the PRI claimed the presidency, the government established the precursor to INE in 1990, known as the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), in response to public outcry. In 1994, the IFE invited international observers (euphemistically called \u201cinternational visitors\u201d to assuage concerns that Mexico was being monitored by foreign actors) to be present in the lead-up to and on election day.\n\nInitially, the IFE maintained close ties to the PRI, but after reforms instituted in 1996, the watchdog gained independence from political mediation and was regarded highly throughout Mexico and abroad. It even served as a model for the establishment of similar bodies elsewhere and helped run elections, as was the case after Timor-Leste became an independent nation in 1999. In 2000, the IFE oversaw the transition of presidential power from the PRI to the National Action Party, breaking 71 years of PRI rule.\n\nSince 2000, the IFE (which became the INE in 2014 after reforms) has overseen three additional presidential elections \u2014 all of which have featured L\u00f3pez Obrador as a candidate. In the two elections he lost in 2006 and 2012, L\u00f3pez Obrador leveled allegations of fraud. In one of these elections, he attempted to establish a parallel presidency. In the third election \u2014 held most recently in 2018 \u2014 he won, with a promise to create an \u201cauthentic democracy,\u201d free of corruption and waste. By early 2021, he had zeroed in on a favorite target: the INE.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador vs. the INE\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has two obsessions \u2014 one regarding the past and another regarding the future \u2014 and both pivot around the INE. He long maintains a grudge against the INE for certifying the 2006 presidential election, which he lost by a razor-thin margin, and which despite his assertions of fraud, international observers viewed as reflective of \u201cthe legitimate will of the Mexican citizens.\u201d As to the future, the last thing that he wants to do at the swearing-in ceremony for Mexico\u2019s next president is place the presidential sash over the shoulders of an opposition president-elect and, in doing so, jeopardize the legacy of his so-called \u201cFourth Transformation\u201d and the survival of his pet projects and policies.\n\nMay 4, 2018\n\nMexico\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT & POLITICS\nMexico\nNora Claudia Lustig\n\nAugust 1, 1998\n\nMexico\n\nLATIN AMERICA & THE CARIBBEAN\nMexico\nMonica Serrano\n\nJune 1, 1998\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s aversion toward the INE transformed into action after the agency fined his MORENA party for campaign finance irregularities in 2018 and disqualified two of its gubernatorial candidates from running for office in 2021. Decrying the INE as \u201crotten,\u201d he put forth legislation to curb its ability to perform its most basic functions \u2014 namely, running free and fair elections. His motivation is purportedly to save money, yet elsewhere he has allowed spending and handouts to run rampant.\n\nIn the first iteration of the proposed reforms, L\u00f3pez Obrador sought to dissolve the nonpartisan INE and replace it with an elected body largely chosen by the executive, among other drastic changes. The initial proposal sparked widespread protest across Mexico in November 2022, leading L\u00f3pez Obrador to rail against the measure\u2019s opponents as \u201cmostly racist, classist and big hypocrites\u201d and organize counterprotests days later. Ultimately, these reforms failed to garner enough support in Congress.\n\nImmediately after the first proposal stalled, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s allies put forth a so-called \u201cPlan B,\u201d which would not change the INE\u2019s structure but would instead gut its budget and bandwidth, forcing the agency to cut staff and close offices across Mexico. These budgetary constraints will have downstream effects, hindering election officials\u2019 ability to update voter registration lists, issue voter identification cards, and train workers to staff polling precincts on election day. Plan B also restricts election officials\u2019 power to penalize candidates who violate campaign laws and punishes individuals who \u201cslander\u201d the government while disseminating election-related materials. What is considered slander in this context is unclear and undoubtedly open to manipulation. Moreover, the fact that this reform would be enacted just over a year before Mexico\u2019s next presidential elections is alone a cause for deep concern. The proposal has since passed the Lower House and Senate \u2014 heralding a victory for the president and another warning shot for the durability of Mexico\u2019s democracy.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s authoritarian impulses\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attack on the INE represents the latest action to undermine independent institutional capacity. This objective underpins many of his austerity measures, which have reduced institutional bandwidth and eviscerated governmental agencies, regulators, and independent and autonomous bodies, both in terms of budget and manpower. Promising to fight against \u201cthe mafia of power,\u201d the president regularly schedules \u201cpopular consultations\u201d for major initiatives, including the controversial (and expensive) scrapping of Mexico City\u2019s airport in favor of his proposal. These referendums seek to bypass Congressional approval, typically draw extremely low turnout, and the results are driven by MORENA strongholds. He also holds daily press conferences to speak directly to \u201cthe people,\u201d which often last over two hours. During this time, he harasses independent journalists and opponents of his political agenda as \u201ccorrupt cretins.\u201d\n\nWith allies across Congress who support his agenda, L\u00f3pez Obrador has taken aim at the judiciary and other independent bodies. He has also made a concerted effort to court the military and expand its role in public life and public policies, despite promises to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Mexico. And although he swept to power with a vow to end corruption and build a more equitable Mexico, his own social programs have been marred by allegations of misappropriated funds and \u201cdisguised clientelism.\u201d He has even appointed a controversial political figure to his administration who oversaw some of the PRI\u2019s most brazen acts of corruption in 1988.\n\nThus far, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s authoritarian acts have done little to dent his popularity \u2014 and he has for now met limited resistance from institutions designed to check his power. With a challenge of his INE proposal at the Supreme Court, it will not be long before the full scope of Mexico\u2019s institutional decay becomes clear.\n\nThe transactional approach of the Biden administration\nAlthough members of the U.S. Congress from both parties quickly criticized the attack on Mexico\u2019s election process, the Biden administration has responded too cautiously to L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s latest illiberal act. When the State Department eventually commented that \u201cwell-resourced, independent electoral systems and respect for judicial independence\u201d are signs of a \u201chealthy democracy,\u201d Mexico\u2019s president shot back on cue: \u201cthere is more democracy in Mexico than could exist in the United States.\u201d\n\nWhereas Biden and others quickly condemned democratic threats in Brazil, the administration\u2019s criticism of Mexico has been more muted. Among other reasons, the administration\u2019s reticence can be explained by its need to ensure Mexican collaboration on immigration \u2014 an area that remains a focus of sharp criticism from Republican politicians despite policies that tow closer to Trump-era strategies. By prioritizing other policy areas over institutional threats to Mexican democracy, the Biden administration risks having its own renewed commitments to democratic norms ring hollow and potentially exacerbating migration and transnational organized crime challenges down the road.\n\nRather than violent insurrection, it is often the slow, systematic cooptation of institutional checks on the executive that facilitates democracies\u2019 demise. Thus far, the Biden administration\u2019s public approach to Mexico has failed to push back against these warning signs. Without firm international condemnation, it\u2019s unlikely L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attack on the INE will be his last on Mexico\u2019s independent institutions before the 2024 presidential elections. Particularly as the United States and other countries in the Americas seek to fortify their own democracies, they ignore the threat to Mexico\u2019s independent institutions at their own peril. Authoritarian regimes around the world will reap the geopolitical, strategic, and ideological benefits of a less democratic and more insular Mexico.\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

The acquisition is expected to close early in the fourth quarter 2023.\nCalcalist revealed the advanced negotiations earlier this week.\n\nErmetic raised a $70 million Series B round of financing in December 2021 led by Qumra Capital with support from new investor Forgepoint Capital and participation from existing investors Accel, Glilot Capital Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Target Global. The company has raised $100 million in total funding for its security platform that provides multi-cloud protection for global enterprise customers.\nErmetic has developed a fully integrated cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) and is also a provider of cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM). \n\nThe company was born from a partnership of four experienced cyber entrepreneurs who had all previously sold companies to giant corporations: CEO Shai Morag (founder and CEO of Cyber Secdo Ltd., acquired by Palo Alto Networks), CTO Michael Dolinsky and CPO Sivan Krigsman (co-founders of Aorato, acquired by Microsoft), and CBO Arick Goomanovsky (co-founder of Sygnia, acquired by Temasek).\nThe startup laid off 30 employees in January, accounting for 17% of its workforce. A third of the employees leaving the company were based in Israel, with all of the departing staff belonging to the marketing, sales, and HR departments. None of those laid off were part of the R&D team.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Tenable\u2019s first acquisition in Israel, with the Nasdaq traded company purchasing Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity company Indegy for around $100 million in cash in December 2019.

{"text":"n August, Bloomberg reported what we at the Human Rights Foundation already knew: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was sending in bots to attack our award-winning Uyghur Forced Labor Checker to deter you from downloading it and discovering the truth behind where your clothes are made and, more importantly, who makes them.\n\nThat's what our Google plug-in does\u2014it lets you know when your shopping cart might be filled with items made by one of the 1.5 million Uyghurs the CCP has forced into concentration camps and asks you to think twice about your purchases.\n\nThat dress you're pining over from New York Fashion Week? It was made by a 16-year-old girl whose family doesn't know where she is or if she is even alive. That T-shirt Gigi Hadid wore on the runway? Made by a man in his 50s who has been tortured, raped, and is under constant surveillance. That coat you saw someone wearing to the afterparty? Made by a woman who used to be a teacher but is now being forced to eliminate her identity as a Uyghur Muslim.\n\n\nThe Uyghur people have their own language, their own culture, and their own identity distinct from the Han Chinese. The CCP is trying to erase their identity, and they're doing so by subjecting them to political indoctrination and grave human rights abuses. They are \"reeducated\" and made to learn Mandarin Chinese. They are forced to have abortions, use intrauterine devices, and receive sterilizations. And they are mandated to work non-stop with little to no pay. Most notably, picking cotton and working in clothing factories.\n\nThe CCP doesn't want you to know these things. In fact, they do everything in their power to ensure you don't by silencing activists and persecuting their families. The first and most obvious reason is that they're trying to eliminate the entire Uyghur population and want to do so without any backlash. And the second is that they have ties to major Western fashion brands, and they don't want that to change.\n\nDo you see the connecting thread?\n\nOne in five pieces of cotton clothing worldwide is linked to Uyghur forced labor. Either Uyghurs were forced to pick the raw material, the cotton, or they cut the fabric and made the clothes that you are wearing.\n\nFast fashion brands like Shein, Nike, Zara, and many others, meanwhile, have been in the spotlight due to their use of Uyghur forced labor. Consumers have boycotted these brands. They have been ridiculed on social media and in the news. And mass protests have occurred to raise awareness of their supply chain.\n\nBut you will likely see a Uyghur original on the runway in New York this week. That's because high-end and luxury brands have, for the most part, gone under the radar when it comes to cotton picked by forced labor\u2014until now.\n\nThe luxury fashion industry is no stranger to mishaps, criticism, or scandals. But when it comes to forced labor, they're trying to skirt responsibility\u2014even as brand representatives insist it won't be \"tolerated.\" They simultaneously admit when pressed they don't source their own raw materials. So how could they possibly know where it comes from?\n\nBlissful ignorance is appalling when lives are at risk.\n\nDemocratic governments worldwide have called the CCP's actions a genocide. But their responses and efforts have been lackluster. The U.S. enacted the only legislation in the world that addresses this issue: the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The UFLPA was enacted in 2022 and prohibits goods produced in the Uyghur region from being sold in the U.S. unless there's clear and convincing evidence that they weren't picked by slaves.\n\nYet clothes made by Uyghurs continue to be sold in the U.S. en masse. There's practically a Zara on every block in New York City. Moreover, for an individual shipment to trigger the reporting requirement, the amount has to exceed $800. So that $200 Shein order you just bought won't get flagged.\n\nThis means it's entirely up to you, the consumer, to demand to know where and how your clothes are made.\n\nDon't be fooled by the pretty colors, sparkles, or the newest trend unveiled during New York Fashion Week. It's not enough to live by your values; you must wear them, too. Lives depend on it.\n\n","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Blink Charging locked in multiple EV charging agreements this week, so why is the stock tanking?\nWhat happened\nBlink Charging (BLNK 2.93%) had two big press releases this week, and they both are going to help the business grow. But investors aren't buying. In fact, Blink shares have plunged this week, down about 13.4% as of early Friday afternoon, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSo what\nThe electric vehicle (EV) charging-equipment company announced a new two-year contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) yesterday. Blink will supply EV charging equipment, including Level 2 and DC fast chargers for both public and commercial fleet applications.\n\nEarlier in the week, blink also announced an agreement with Arcos Dorados, a company that operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean. The largest McDonald's franchisee in the world will use Blink's EV charging solutions for five McDonald's restaurants it owns in Puerto Rico. \n\nBut there's another elephant in the room that EV charging-network investors are watching and that likely has contributed to Blink's shares hitting a 3-year low this week. \n\nNow what\nEV leader Tesla has been signing deals with a growing number of EV makers to open up its supercharging network to non-Tesla vehicles. Now stock analysts are starting to put a valuation on that portion of its business, and investors are likely thinking that will be business taken from other EV charging-network companies. \n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives looked at the potential for Tesla's Supercharger network and told clients he believes it will represent as much as $10 billion to $20 billion in revenue by 2030. That would be a lot of potentially lost business especially considering that Blink expects 2023 revenue of between $110 million and $120 million. \n\nBlink Charging is also not yet profitable and doesn't expect to be until at least the end of next year. That has some speculative EV investors moving investments elsewhere this week. \n\nBefore you invest in Blink Charging...\nWhat if we told you that you could be getting more for your money?\n\nThere are plenty of good stocks out there.

{"text":"The social media company went public in 2013. But Elon Musk is taking it private as part of his acquisition of the firm. Here\u2019s what that means\n\nBy Kate Conger\nOct. 28, 2022\nElon Musk closes his purchase of Twitter and fires several top executives. Follow for the latest news updates.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In August 2018, Elon Musk called Michael Dell for advice.\n\nMr. Musk, who was trying to take Tesla, his electric car company, private, quizzed Mr. Dell, who had done that very thing with his eponymous computer company in 2013, about the process and the best lawyers to use for the complicated transaction.\n\n\u201cI was really asking him about \u2014 did he find being private was good?\u201d Mr. Musk recalled in a deposition about the Tesla effort. \u201cDid he regret going private?\u201d\n\nMr. Dell warned Mr. Musk that it was \u201ca very difficult process\u201d but that he was glad to have done it, according to court filings.\n\nNow, Mr. Musk, who did not end up taking Tesla private, is doing so with Twitter. As part of his $44 billion acquisition of the social media service, which closed on Thursday, he is delisting the company\u2019s stock and taking it out of the hands of public shareholders.\n\nMaking Twitter a private company gives Mr. Musk some advantages. Unlike publicly traded companies, privately held firms do not have to make quarterly public disclosures about their performance. They are also subject to less regulatory scrutiny and can be more tightly controlled by an owner. That means Mr. Musk can make over Twitter \u2014 including tweaking the platform\u2019s content rules, its finances and its priorities \u2014 without having to consider the worries of the investing public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to run a public company if you think you should be the one running it and you\u2019re not open to other views from people, like stockholders,\u201d said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. \u201cBy taking it private, you feel like you have a lot more flexibility.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Twitter is set to change as a private company under Mr. Musk.\n\nHow is Mr. Musk taking Twitter private?\nAs part of buying Twitter, Mr. Musk is merging the social media company with X Holdings, a corporate entity that he established in Delaware to handle the deal. X is buying out all of Twitter\u2019s stock and will control the service, and Mr. Musk will control the holding company.\n\nWhat happens to Twitter\u2019s stock?\nTwitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and its shares will no longer trade on public markets as of Nov. 8, according to a securities filing. In September, Twitter\u2019s shareholders approved the company\u2019s sale to Mr. Musk and agreed to sell their stock to him for $54.20 a share. Investors will be able to claim the cash value of their shares.\n\nWhat happens to Twitter\u2019s board of directors?\nWith the deal\u2019s completion, Twitter\u2019s board of directors will dissolve and its nine members will no longer preside over the company\u2019s operations. Mr. Musk will most likely appoint a new board made up of friends and investors who helped fund the acquisition. The new board will be responsible for plotting Twitter\u2019s trajectory as a private company.\n\n\u201cIt will still be required by law to have a board of directors, and that would probably include Elon Musk and some of the other big equity investors in the company,\u201d said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. \u201cI expect Mr. Musk will run it as a somewhat friendly dictatorship.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to Twitter\u2019s top executives?\nMr. Musk has already started cleaning house, with several of Twitter\u2019s top executives getting fired on Thursday.\n\nThe executives who were fired include Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, who has clashed publicly and privately with Mr. Musk. When Mr. Musk complained this year that Twitter had an unchecked spam problem, Mr. Agrawal tweeted to rebut his claims. Mr. Musk responded with a poop emoji.\n\nAt another point, Mr. Agrawal texted Mr. Musk, telling the billionaire that his criticisms were harming Twitter, according to a court filing.\n\n\u201cThis is a waste of time,\u201d Mr. Musk retorted.\n\nOther executives who were fired include Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel.\n\nUnder the merger agreement, Mr. Agrawal was potentially set to receive a golden parachute worth about $60 million, with Mr. Segal to receive $46 million, while Ms. Gadde would receive about $20 million. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Musk intended to make the payments.\n\nParag Agrawal was fired by Mr. Musk as Twitter\u2019s chief executive on Thursday. Credit...Kevin Dietsch\/Getty Images\n\nWhat about Twitter\u2019s employees?\nTwitter has about 7,500 employees. Some of them have been jittery for months about the company\u2019s sale to Mr. Musk. Many could face layoffs or job changes as their new owner takes over.\n\nTheir compensation is also set to change. Employees typically receive stock options in the company. But, with the delisting of Twitter\u2019s stock, employees are set to be cashed out for shares they already have and to be paid with cash bonuses going forward, instead of the stock options they were scheduled to receive, according to the merger agreement. Some employees have worried that Mr. Musk may not honor the agreement.\n\n\u201cMost of these employees have been in a public company and are used to public option grants, which are liquid,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cThey will have to come up with some other Silicon Valley-friendly method of keeping people around.\u201d\n\nWhat financial pressures will Twitter face as a private company?\nBy going private, Twitter will avoid some public scrutiny since it will no longer be required to make quarterly disclosures about the health of its business. This will give Mr. Musk some flexibility as he changes Twitter.\n\nBut he will face pressure from the banks that lent him $12.5 billion for the deal to begin repaying his debt. The cost of repaying those loans could run as high as $1 billion a year, financial analysts said.\n\n\u201cHe has less public pressure, but he has a lot of private pressure from the banks to make the payments,\u201d Mr. Quinn said of Mr. Musk. \u201cLike almost every other private-equity take-private, he\u2019s going to need a manager who is very focused on operations, being lean and being able to pay the bills on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\nMr. Musk also took about $7.1 billion from equity investors to push the deal through. He may also face pressure from those investors, who might expect him to take Twitter public again at some point so that they can recoup their investment.\n\nIn some take-private deals, owners have opted to sell branches of their companies to pay their debts. Mr. Musk could choose to do the same at Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that some aspects of Twitter could potentially be carved off, sold off or spun off to raise money that could go toward paying the debt,\u201d Mr. Talley said. \u201cTwitter kind of is pared down to its core mission right now. They would have to get a little creative.\u201d\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"Starfield has taken around eight years for development, but the game has finally gone gold. With reviews and early access right around the corner, the anticipation from Xbox users is at an all-time high.\n\nThis anticipation has carried over to the sales of the Xbox Series X, with the console receiving a 100% boost in sales due to Starfield.\n\nWhy it matters: Starfield is arguably Bethesda\u2019s biggest IP to date, and Microsoft is heavily investing in the game as it is also an important first-party release.\n\n\nIn April 2023, the sales of Xbox Series X were down by 30% from the previous year, which caused some concerns. However, after the Xbox Showcase and Starfield Direct, fans have much to look forward to, leading to more interest in the console than before.\n\nAmazon is currently selling 10 times as many Xbox Series X consoles as normal. This sales boost is a result of Microsoft\u2019s recent marketing and publicity efforts for the highly-anticipated RPG release.\n\nMicrosoft has high hopes for Starfield as the gaming giant expects record-breaking revenue in Q1 FY24 after its launch. If the Xbox Series X sales on Amazon are anything to go by, this is not too far-fetched.\n\nWhile Starfield is the biggest contributor to the anticipation, Microsoft also has a strong first-party lineup ahead. The gaming giant recently claimed that Starfield is just the starting gun for this lineup.\n\nForza Motorsport is already scheduled for 2023, and games like Hellblade 2 will continue to ensure quality single-player offerings from the gaming giant in 2024. Phil Spencer has also suggested Microsoft may need multiple showcases each year for this lineup.\n","labels":["financial_success"]}

The virus in China caused two confirmed human infections in 2022, followed by a fatal case reported this year.\n\nVirus can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome\nUsing lab mice and ferrets as models for human infection, the study found that the virus has undergone several adaptive changes, causing severe animal infections and making it transmissible by air between animals.\n\n A dark-eyed junco bird. (credit: Wikimedia Commons)\nPeople, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically na\u00efve to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 AIVs, and could be highly vulnerable to infection, said Prof. Jinhua Liu of the China Agricultural University in Beijing.\n\nIn humans, the avian H3N8 virus infection has been found to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and can even be fatal. The virus is widespread in chicken flocks, but until now, the features of how it might be transmitted from animals to humans have been poorly understood.\n\n\u201cWe show that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated efficiently in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells, was extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts, and could be passed on through respiratory droplets,\u201d said Prof. Kin-Chow Chang of the University of Nottingham.\n\n\u201cImportantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission.

(\u201cEscrow Issuer\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, has launched an offering of $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior secured notes due 2028 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and that the company is seeking to enter into an incremental term loan facility, in each case in connection with the financing of its pending acquisition (\u201cAcquisition\u201d) of XIIDRA (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) 5%, a non-steroid eye drop specifically approved to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease focusing on inflammation associated with dry eye, and certain other ophthalmology assets.\n\nThe definitive documentation for the incremental term loan facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) may be in the form of either an incremental amendment to the company\u2019s existing credit agreement or a separate credit agreement. Bausch + Lomb is expected to borrow $500 million of new term B loans (\u201cNew Term B Loans\u201d) under the Term Loan Facility.\n\nThe net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, along with the expected proceeds from the New Term B Loans, are expected to fund the Acquisition, to pay fees and expenses related to the closing of the Acquisition, the offering of the Notes and the borrowings of the New Term B Loans and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt.\n\nIf the issuance of the Notes occurs prior to the closing of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be issued by the Escrow Issuer, and the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be deposited into a segregated escrow account. Upon closing of the Acquisition, Bausch + Lomb will assume the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the indenture that will govern the Notes and any other obligations of the Escrow Issuer and receive all of the assets of the Escrow Issuer, and the net proceeds will be released from the escrow account and applied as set forth above. However, if the issuance of the Notes occurs substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, Bausch + Lomb will be the issuer of the Notes and the escrow provision described above will not apply.\n\nFrom and after the closing of the Acquisition, the Notes will be guaranteed by each of the company\u2019s subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Term Loan Facility and the existing term loan facility and will be secured on a first-priority basis by liens on the assets that secure the Term Loan Facility and the existing term loan facility.\n\nClosing of the Term Loan Facility will be conditioned upon completion of the Acquisition and is anticipated to occur concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition at or around the end of September 2023. Closing of the Notes offering will not be conditioned upon completion of the Acquisition, but if the Acquisition does not occur on or prior to Sept. 30, 2024, or other specified events do not occur, the Escrow Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes at such time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nThe foregoing transactions are subject to market and other conditions. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully complete the transactions, on the terms described above, or at all.\n\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or any state securities law and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered in the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.

{"text":"Change is afoot in the semiconductor industry. The Biden administration has provided new funding amid concerns that the U.S. has become too dependent on microchips made abroad. Tensions are also rising between China and Taiwan, where most chips are made. Will this lead to supply chain problems?\n\nIntel is hoping to even the playing field by building new factories in Arizona, Ohio, and Germany. Specifically, the company is planning to invest at least $20 billion in two new factories in Ohio.\n\nDavid Zinsner, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel, said that the stakes are high: Intel has a global presence and is not immune from intense geopolitical challenges.\n\n\u201cWhere Intel is complex is in these kind of more geopolitical challenges. There are a lot of things that are very single-threaded and can just completely bankrupt a company if decisions aren\u2019t made correctly,\u201d Zinsner said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s where the pressure, I think, is a little bit higher [for us].\u201d\n\nAt the most recent MIT Sloan CFO Summit, finance professorMatthew Rhodes-Kropfspoke with Zinsner about these tough geopolitical challenges as well as intellectual property and creative financing. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\nNavigating geopolitical challenges\nThe U.S. currently accounts for only about 12% of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Many worry that in the event of an escalated conflict between Taiwan and China, semiconductor supply chains may be disrupted, which is why U.S. chipmakers are ramping up their operations stateside.\n\nZinsner said that if Intel emerges as a robust supplier, it could help reduce the tension between China and Taiwan.\n\n\u201cBecause we are creating this U.S.-European supply for semiconductors, in a way I feel like we are lowering the geopolitical tensions that are out there,\u201d Zinsner said. \u201cBecause Taiwan is so important to the world, it becomes this lightning rod for China and the U.S., but if there is a more balanced supply chain, it becomes less \u2026 volatile.\u201d\n\nGetting creative with financing\n\nIn addition building plants in Arizona, Ohio, and Germany, Intel is expanding in Israel and Ireland. The Arizona project \u2014 which is projected to cost $30 billion \u2014 is \u201cnot something that even Intel can do on its own, so we\u2019ve had to lean on government support,\u201d Zinsner said.\n\nThe CHIPS Act should help. Passed by Congress last year to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing, design, and research, the act provides around $52 billion in new funding for U.S. manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\nAdditionally, Intel has partnered with infrastructure investment firm Brookfield on some \u201ccreative financing,\u201d Zinsner said: Brookfield will jointly invest in the fabrication plant in Arizona such that \u201cas the fab starts to generate cash flow, which doesn\u2019t happen for four or five years, then we share in the cash flow.\u201d\n\nIntel \u201cgives up a little bit of the upside in the outer years,\u201d Zinsner said, \u201cbut it gives us $15 billion to work with, which is obviously pretty helpful in terms of financing.\u201d\n\nProtecting intellectual property\nAmid concerns that China is infringing on U.S. intellectual property, the U.S. government has issued regulations that will prohibit China from advancing in the semiconductor race. The rules aim to stop U.S. and non-U.S. companies from supplying Chinese entities with hardware or software comprising American technology in its supply chain.\n\nZinsner acknowledged this friction and said that while China is a \u201cmeaningful\u201d market for Intel, it\u2019s still important to protect U.S. intellectual property, calling this trade-off \u201ca balancing act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key is to make sure that we are supporting [Chinese] customers, but also staying true to the rules that the U.S. puts in place to protect very advanced technology from getting into those markets,\u201d Zinsner said.\n\n\u201cI do think that semiconductor companies generate a lot of income from selling globally, and all that global cash flow comes back into R&D investments that end up helping the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it has to be a very careful approach \u2014 how to protect IP in a way that makes sure that all companies remain healthy in the process.\u201d","labels":["investments"]}

{"text":"WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a challenge by President Joe Biden's administration to the legality of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, putting on hold a deal that would shield its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits over their role in the country's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe justices paused bankruptcy proceedings concerning Purdue and its affiliates and said they would hold oral arguments in December in the administration's appeal of a lower court's ruling upholding the settlement. The Supreme Court's new term begins in October.\n\nPurdue's owners under the settlement would receive immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed by states, hospitals, people who had become addicted and others who have sued the Stamford, Connecticut-based company over its misleading marketing of the powerful pain medication OxyContin.\n\nIn a statement, Purdue said it was disappointed that the U.S. Trustee, the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog that filed the challenge at the Supreme Court, has been able to \"single-handedly delay billions of dollars in value that should be put to use for victim compensation, opioid crisis abatement for communities across the country and overdose rescue medicines.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the legality of our nearly universally supported plan of reorganization, and optimistic that the Supreme Court will agree,\" the company added.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nAt issue is whether U.S. bankruptcy law allows Purdue's restructuring to include legal protections for the members of the Sackler family, who have not filed for personal bankruptcy.\n\nPurdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 to address its debts, nearly all of which stemmed from thousands of lawsuits alleging that OxyContin helped kickstart an opioid epidemic that has caused more than 500,000 U.S. overdose deaths over two decades.\n\nPurdue estimates that its bankruptcy settlement, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in 2021, would provide $10 billion in value to its creditors, including state and local governments, individual victims of addiction, hospitals, and others who have sued the company.\n\nThe Biden administration and eight states challenged the settlement, but all of the states dropped their opposition after the Sacklers agreed to contribute more to the settlement fund.\n\nIn May, the 2nd Circuit upheld the settlement, concluding that federal bankruptcy law allows legal protections for non-bankrupt parties like the Sacklers in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit ruled that the legal claims against Purdue were inextricably linked to claims against its owners, and that allowing lawsuits to continue targeting the Sacklers would undermine Purdue's efforts to reach a bankruptcy settlement.\n\nMembers of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing but expressed regret that OxyContin \"unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.\" They said in May that the bankruptcy settlement would provide \"substantial resources for people and communities in need.\"\n\nIn a court filing, the administration told the Supreme Court that Purdue's settlement is an abuse of bankruptcy protections meant for debtors in \"financial distress,\" not people like the Sacklers. According to the administration, Sackler family members withdrew $11 billion from Purdue before agreeing to contribute $6 billion to its opioid settlement.\n\nMany other stakeholders have responded in opposition to the administration's request to halt the settlement.\n\nA group comprising more than 60,000 people who have filed personal injury claims stemming from their exposure to Purdue opioid products told the Supreme Court they support the settlement, including legal immunity for members of the Sackler family.\n\n\"Regardless of how one feels about the role of the Sackler family in the creation and escalation of the opioid crisis,\" the group told the justices, \"the fact remains that the billions of dollars in abatement and victim compensation funds hinge on confirmation and consummation of the existing plan.\"","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"One of the more frustrating roadblocks in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic was the difficulty in getting quick, accurate test results. Sometimes, results for PCR tests took up to two weeks, rendering their diagnosis useless for planning isolation scenarios. Meanwhile, rapid tests still oftentimes provide a false negative if taken too soon after infection. When I had COVID, I was four days into symptoms before I got a positive at-home test\u2014I've heard many people recount similar stories.\n\nThe testing we have is certainly better than nothing, but it leaves a lot to be desired. If only there were a better way, say, using something with remarkable innate sensitivity. Like, dogs. Far-fetched? Not at all.\n\nA review of recent research concluded that scent dogs may represent a cheaper, faster, and more effective way to detect COVID-19 and could be a key tool in future pandemics. This could be a game-changer for sustainability as well, eliminating the enormous amount of waste that comes with billions of testing kits.\n\nThe review, published in De Gruyter's Journal of Osteopathic Medicine, found that scent dogs are as effective, or even more effective, than conventional COVID-19 tests such as PCR tests.\n\nMost of us know that dogs have a remarkable sense of smell; they sniff out drugs and explosives and have even successfully identified patients with certain cancers, Parkinson\u2019s, and diabetes. They have up to 300 million olfactory cells, compared to 5 or 6 million in humans. And they use one-third of their brains to process scent information\u2014humans just use 5%.\n\n 6 Medical Conditions That Dogs Can Sniff Out\nProfessor Tommy Dickey of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Heather Junqueira of BioScent Detection Dogs analyzed 29 different studies in which dogs detected COVID-19. \"The studies were performed using over 31,000 samples by over 400 scientists from more than 30 countries using 19 different dog breeds. In some studies, the scent dogs sniffed people directly, sometimes in public places as a health screening. In others, the dogs sniffed patient samples such as sweat, saliva, or urine samples,\" explains a press statement from De Gruyter.\n\nDogs' Incredible Accuracy\nThe dogs ranged from Labrador retrievers and Belgian malinois to beagles and English springer spaniels. In most of the studies, the dogs demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and specificity than the current gold-standard PCR tests or antigen tests.\n\n\"In one study, four of the dogs could detect the equivalent of less than 2.6 x 10\u221212 copies of viral RNA per milliliter. This is equivalent to detecting one drop of any odorous substance dissolved in ten and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools and is three orders of magnitude better than modern scientific instruments,\" notes De Gruyter.\n\nRemarkably, they not only detected COVID-19 in symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients, but they could also sniff out COVID variants and even long COVID.\n\nConsidering the Safety of the Dogs\nOne thing we certainly don't want is for dogs to become collateral damage in the pursuit of better testing. The study authors acknowledge this, writing that the \"safety of scent dogs, their handlers, and those who are inspected by the dogs is critical for the acceptance and implementation of the scent dog screening and testing approach.\"\n\n\"This is consistent with the One Health paradigm,\" they add, \"which defines health as more than the absence of disease and recognizes the interrelationships among humans, animals, and environmental welfare.\"\n\nThe authors evaluated whether medical detection dogs could contract and become ill with the COVID-19 virus and if dogs pass on the COVID-19 virus to humans. From a number of studies, they concluded that dogs are in the low-risk category. \"To our knowledge, there have been no deaths of dogs that can be unequivocally attributed to COVID-19,\" the authors explain. \"Importantly, the studies described above suggest that it is safe for healthy individual handlers to utilize scent dogs to directly screen and test individuals who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.\"\nSpeedy Test Results\nA major benefit of using the dogs is their speed. In one study, researchers were able to do a lineup with 40 samples, including sample collection, lineup loading, and unloading, within just 3\u202f minutes.\n\n\"The time between RT-PCR sampling and the return of results can be up to days, whereas the RAG test results are obtained within about 15\u202fmin.,\" write the study authors. \"Again, if scent dogs directly sniff individuals, results are learned in seconds, or a few minutes if samples are taken and sniffed soon after by the dogs.\"\n\n\"The criticality of the speed of the return of test results cannot be overemphasized,\" the authors add.\n\nElimination of Plastic Waste\nThat dogs could provide a result in seconds to minutes is crucial. But additionally, and importantly, scent tests by dogs don't require expensive lab equipment or create mountains of plastic waste, unlike conventional diagnostic approaches.\n\nAs of December 22, 2022, the United States alone had performed around 1.15 billion tests for COVID-19. Thinking of all the material for the testing kits and all the resources used for testing labs and sending samples around, etc., the reduction in ecological footprint is potentially tremendous.\n\nNot to mention the cost. Some of the research in the review was, in fact, motivated by the need for inexpensive testing in developing nations, the authors note.\n\n\u201cAlthough many people have heard about the exceptional abilities of dogs to help humans, their value to the medical field has been considered fascinating, but not ready for real-world medical use,\u201d says Dickey. \u201cHaving conducted this review, we believe that scent dogs deserve their place as a serious diagnostic methodology that could be particularly useful during pandemics, potentially as part of rapid health screenings in public spaces. We are confident that scent dogs will be useful in detecting a wide variety of diseases in the future.\"","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

The hacker ordered a new cell phone after seizing control of his cellular network account, and then ported Stephen\u2019s private cell number to a SIM in the new device, according to a lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16.\n\nThis exploit is known as a SIM-swap attack, which the Federal Bureau of Investigations warned in 2022 were increasingly common and targeted at victims who were likely to own large amounts of cryptocurrency. The FBI estimates that $72 million was stolen in SIM-swap attacks last year, up from $68 million in 2021.\n\nStephens founded Blockchain Capital in 2013 with his brother Brad Stephens. The San Francisco-based fund has since gone on to back crypto startups like Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and NFT exchange Opensea. Blockchain Capital\u2019s Twitter account was hacked earlier this month to promote a crypto token, according to Cointelegraph.\n\nStephens\u2019 lawsuit claims that the hacker used his cell phone number to reset passwords, and pass two factor authentication tests, at several unnamed digital wallets and then \u201cbegan to systematically steal plaintiff's digital assets.\u201d\n\nA day before the hacker moved $6.3 million to their private crypto wallets, they wrote to Stephens to brag that they could \u201cremotely hack anyone\u2019s phone number in the mainland U.S.\u201d in a message sent from one of his own hacked accounts to his work email.\n\nThe hacker also tried to steal bitcoin and ethereum worth $14 million from a \u201ccustodial cold wallet\u201d owned by Stephens but were blocked by a Blockchain Capital employee who had been notified of the withdrawal. \u201cThis notification was the first time that Plaintiff learned that Plaintiff\u2019s [redacted] account was under attack,\u201d Stephens\u2019 attorney wrote in the lawsuit.\n\n\nStephens\u2019 cell phone network only confirmed on May 15, a day after the funds were stolen, that he had been the victim of a SIM-swap attack. Around half of the funds were moved to cryptocurrency tumbler exchanges that mix digital assets which can help anonymise transactions, and make tracing stolen bitcoin and other coins harder. Stephens did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSIM-swap attacks typically rely on hackers manipulating or \u201csocial engineering,\u201d tricking cell phone network customer service operators into revealing personal information about a victim. The hacker then uses that information to pass security tests needed to port a victim\u2019s phone number to a new SIM card and phone in their control.\n\nIn one of the largest SIM-swap attacks to date, Florida man Nicholas Truglia was sentenced to 18 months in jail in December 2022 for the theft of over $20 million from crypto investors including Transform Ventures\u2019 Michael Terpin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStephens has long been an outspoken proponent of crypto and a foil to critics like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has repeatedly dismissed bitcoin as a fraud. \u201cI would encourage Jamie Dimon and others to do some homework first. It is not a fraud. It is not a Ponzi scheme. It\u2019s a robust technology that is going to impact multiple industries,\u201d Stephens told CNBC in 2017.\n\nSend me a secure tip. \nIain Martin\n\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}

Behind the scenes, the companies effectively determine what drugs get covered by insurance companies and how much a patient will pay for it.

{"text":"New York\nCNN\n \u2014 \nBoeing reported a $650 million operating loss in the fourth quarter, surprising Wall Street analysts who had expected the aircraft giant to turn a profit.\n\nThe company blamed the unexpected loss on \u201cabnormal production costs\u201d as it tried both to deliver the remaining backlog of 737 Max jets and to step up deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners. The company\u2019s production of the 787 remains below normal rates.\n\n\u201cWe continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines \u2026 as we run into supply chain shortfalls,\u201d CEO Dave Calhoun told investors Wednesday. \u201cSo those stoppages, while they are coming down, are not where they need to be.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Boeing had to shell out an unspecified amount of compensation to 787 customers whose deliveries were delayed by about a year.\n\nThe company also warned Wednesday that it will post a loss in the current quarter, although it did not give a range. That\u2019s a disappointment, as analysts have been forecasting the Boeing would report a narrow profit for the quarter.\n\nShares of Boeing (BA) were down more than 3% in late morning trading after that guidance.\n\nBoeing has reported only two profitable quarters in the nearly four years since the grounding of the 737 Max. After two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, the jet was grounded for 20 months starting in March 2019. Then a year later, the pandemic brought demand for flying and new aircraft to a near halt \u2014 sparking the cancellation of hundreds of jet orders and the pileup of losses for Boeing.\n\nStill, the industry has shown signs of picking up, and analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast that Boeing would earn 26 cents a share. Instead it reported a loss of $1.75 a share. So while that\u2019s an improvement from the loss of $7.69 a share in the fourth quarter of of 2021, it\u2019s also another big disappointment.\n\nA difficult few years\nBoeing\u2019s problems in the fourth quarter are tied to its difficult few years since the 737 Max crisis.\n\nFor one, the company was saddled with excess inventory of hundreds of the jets. Usually Boeing doesn\u2019t hold onto inventory, as planes are delivered to customers soon after completion.\n\nBut even though the 737 Max jets couldn\u2019t be delivered during the grounding, Boeing kept building them \u2014 partly to keep its suppliers in business. Then it was forced to find new buyers for some of those planes due to customers canceling orders during the pandemic.\n\nBeyond the Max, the FAA flagged quality problems with the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliners that stopped it from delivering that model. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still affected the company: Much of Boeing\u2019s abnormal production costs last quarter were a result of having to rework both the Max and Dreamliner jets, CEO Dave Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday.\n\nThe supply chain problems are improving, Calhoun added, but they are not behind the company or the aerospace industry as a whole, He suggested more money-losing quarters may be ahead despite a rebound in demand, saying he expects Boeing to have \u201cbouncy\u201d margins throughout the year as its Max and Dreamliner inventories are cleared.\n\nBoeing delivered 152 commercial jets in the quarter, up 54% from a year ago and better than its own target.\n\nBut digging deeper into the financial results highlights a potential problem: It appears Boeing received lower prices on some of its planes than analysts had expected.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company\u2019s revenue fell short of forecasts, coming in at just below $20 billion. While it was Boeing\u2019s highest revenue figure since the start of the pandemic, it was about $360 million less than analysts\u2019 consensus estimate. The combination of better-than-expected deliveries but worse-than-forecast revenue suggests that weaker pricing.\n\n\u2018Focused on driving stability\u2019\nBoeing tried to put the best spin possible on its disappointing results.\n\nThe company pointed out that this was the first full year of positive operating cash flow since the start of the 737 Max crisis. Boeing finally brought in $3.5 billion more cash than it spent, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 of positive operating cash flow of between $4.5 bililon to $6.5 billion.\n\n\u201cDemand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond,\u201d said Calhoun in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWhile challenges remain, we are well positioned and are on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength.\u201d","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Most readers would already know that General Electric's (NYSE:GE) stock increased by 9.0% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study General Electric's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for General Electric\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:\n\n33% = US$11b \u00f7 US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nGeneral Electric's Earnings Growth And 33% ROE\nFirstly, we acknowledge that General Electric has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 21% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, General Electric's considerable five year net income growth of 57% was to be expected.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between General Electric's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 52% in the same 5-year period.\n\npast-earnings-growth\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GE worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether GE is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs General Electric Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\nGeneral Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.4%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.\n\nMoreover, General Electric is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 6.5% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 16% over the same period.\n\nSummary\nIn total, we are pretty happy with General Electric's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

{"text":"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Bath & Body Works (BBWI.N) on Wednesday warned of a steeper decline in annual sales as Americans deferred purchasing its pricier home fragrances and personal care products amid still-high inflation pinching household budgets.\n\nShares of the Ohio-based company fell about 2% in premarket trading after the retailer forecast current-quarter sales and profit below Street expectations.\n\nA rise in costs of living and credit repayments at higher borrowing costs in the U.S. have prompted consumers to cut down on purchasing non-essential items. This has led to a slowdown in demand for products such as home fragrances and beauty and skincare.\n\nThe company's results come in line with specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL.N) and department store chain Macy's (M.N), which have warned of weak consumer spending through the remainder of the year.\n\nBath & Body Works now expects annual net sales to decline between 1.5% and 3.5%, compared with its previous forecast of flat net sales to a mid-single-digit percentage decline.\n\nTo fend off a hit on margins from surging labor and production costs, the retailer resorted to price hikes on its products that further discouraged demand from inflation-weary Americans.\n\nThe company's second-quarter sales fell 3.6% to $1.56 billion, largely in line with Street expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data.\n\nExcluding items, it earned 40 cents per share in the quarter, topping analysts' expectations of a profit of 33 cents per share.\n\nIt also raised its annual profit forecast to adjusted earnings per share now expected to range between $2.80 and $3.10, compared with $2.68 and $3.08 previously expected.\n\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"Crypto investors got a rude awakening in August. After a period of relatively calm markets, major cryptocurrencies saw a significant selloff. Bitcoin lost more than 10% of its value within the span of a few days. \n\nAmong the factors being blamed for the most recent decline is the decision by Elon Musk's Space X to sell off a big chunk of its Bitcoin holdings \n[1]\n. But given its track record, Bitcoin's volatility will likely continue, and investors should buckle up. \n\nThough the factors driving each crypto crash are different, it can be helpful to remember a few established investing principles, like choosing how much of your overall portfolio should be invested in crypto and remembering why you invested in the first place.\n\nThe latest market shock is another jarring bump in the road for cryptocurrency, which has seen its value plummet since the highs of 2021. Here's a rundown of a few of the factors that have been driving uncertainty and volatility so far this year.\n\nWhat can cause a crypto crash?\nCrypto prices can be dramatically affected by major events, such as exchanges or coins crashing. They can also sink with higher interest rates, rising inflation and other macroeconomic factors that can affect how confident people feel investing their money in risky alternative assets.\n\nRegulatory factors and financial enforcement actions like those carried out by the SEC can also affect the market.\n\nAnd when prices fall rapidly, that can compound the pressure on the market by forcing some investors to free up cash so they can meet other obligations.\n\nIn the case of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 , the impact to the market was enormous. The FTX crash didn't just affect FTX, but also cryptocurrencies FTX heavily invested in (such as Solana) and firms FTX did business with. \n\nThe crypto exchange BlockFi, which received a line of credit from FTX.US and was set to be acquired by the company later in the year, froze withdrawals before filing for bankruptcy itself a few weeks after FTX did.\n\nHas crypto crashed before? \nYes, multiple times. For example, Bitcoin recorded a previous record high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, but by December 2018 was trading below $3,500. It reached an all-time high of about $69,000 in November 2021 and in the year since dropped by more than 75%.\n\nI\u2019m worried about keeping my crypto with an exchange. What should I do?\nConsider moving your digital assets to a separate crypto wallet. Most exchanges allow you to transfer assets to these wallets, which can be online (on a separate platform) or offline (on a thumb drive with added security features).\n\nWhat are the risks of buying crypto?\nWhen crypto is crashing, someone who's been intrigued from the sideline might think this is the time to get in and \"buy low.\" But while prices can recover \u2014 and have done so in the past \u2014 the recovery could take months or years.\n\nConditions might also get worse before they get better. Following a major crash, prices could also continue to go down for some time, especially if the event causes financial troubles for other exchanges or currencies.\n\nUnlike traditional financial exchanges, crypto markets don't have circuit breakers, which automatically pause trading when prices dive too quickly. This means prices could plunge much faster than traditional investments.\n\nAnother distinction between crypto and securities such as stocks is that crypto trades around the clock. If you're worried about swings in value, you might find it hard to sleep. \n\nThere's also a chance any given cryptocurrency could go to zero, or close to zero, following a massive sell-off. Such was the case with Terra and Luna.\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"The US justice department has sued the two petrochemical giants behind a facility in Louisiana\u2019s \u201cCancer Alley\u201d responsible for the highest cancer risk rates caused by air pollution in the US in a major federal lawsuit that seeks to substantially curb the plant\u2019s emissions.\n\nUnveiled on Tuesday, the lawsuit alleges emissions at the Pontchartrain Works facility in Reserve, Louisiana, violate the Clean Air Act and \u201cpresent an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare\u201d.\n\nThe Dupont\/Denka plant as seen from a levee wall on the opposite side of River Road. St. John the Baptist Parish has the highest risk of cancer from air pollution in the United States because of chloroprene, a gas which the Dupont\/Denka neoprene plant has been emitting into the community for 48 years. Credit: William Widmer\/Redux \/ eyevine\nCancer and chemicals in Reserve, Louisiana: the science explained\nRead more\nThe move marks a significant escalation of the Biden administration\u2019s enforcement action in the Cancer Alley region, and was instantly hailed by members of the predominantly Black community around the plant as a major victory in their ongoing campaign for clean air.\n\nSuing on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the justice department is now seeking a federal court order to compel Denka (DPE), the Japanese chemical giant operating the facility, to \u201cimmediately take all necessary measures\u201d to curb emissions of the compound chloroprene, labeled by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen.\n\nThe facility is the only site in the US to emit the compound, which is a primary constituent of the synthetic rubber neoprene. EPA air monitoring around the facility has consistently shown readings well in excess of the recommended lifetime exposure limit of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\n\u201cThis will have a tremendous impact on our struggle here,\u201d said Robert Taylor, a founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish. \u201cOver the six years we have been fighting this fight we haven\u2019t had anything as great as this to happen in terms of getting concrete action on emissions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Taylor added: \u201cThe state government has totally ignored us \u2013 marches on the capitol, rallying \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t even give us an audience. And for the administration to come in and do this, it just validates our efforts.\u201d\n\nEPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that he had promised \u201cstrong action\u201d for community members during a site visit to Reserve in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThis complaint filed against Denka delivers on that promise,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThe company has not moved far enough or fast enough to reduce emissions or ensure the safety of the surrounding community. This action is not the first step we have taken to reduce risks to the people living in St John the Baptist Parish, and it will not be the last.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by Denka on Tuesday said the company \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the legal action and urged the EPA to re-evaluate its findings on chloroprene exposure. The company has been lobbying the federal government for years, claiming the compound\u2019s peer-reviewed classification is based on outdated science.\n\n\u201cDPE is in compliance with its air permits and applicable law. EPA is taking an unprecedented step \u2013 deviating from its permitting and rulemaking authorities \u2013 to allege an \u2018emergency\u2019 based on outdated and erroneous science the agency released over 12 years ago,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe lawsuit also names a subsidiary of the US chemicals giant DuPont, which constructed the Pontchartrain Works facility as a neoprene plant and operated it for over half a century.\n\nDuPont sold the plant to Denka in 2015 in a secretive deal, which the Guardian later revealed was motivated by concerns from DuPont that it would face heavier regulation after the EPA\u2019s decision to classify chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen. The revelations were part of a years-long Guardian series examining air pollution in Reserve and throughout Cancer Alley.\n\nDuPont remains the owner of the land beneath Denka\u2019s facility and acts as a landlord, according to the complaint, meaning DuPont may need to grant permissions in order for emissions to be reduced.\n\nDuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, associate attorney general Vanita Gupta said: \u201cThe justice department\u2019s environmental justice efforts require ensuring that every community, no matter its demographics, can breathe clean air and drink clean water. Our suit aims to stop Denka\u2019s dangerous pollution.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit contains further details of the plant\u2019s recent chloroprene emissions, which fell after Denka constructed emissions offset technology after its purchase of the plant, but still remains dangerously high and in some locations 14 times over the recommended exposure limit.\n\nAccording to EPA calculations in the suit, current chloroprene emissions present a risk \u201cthat is especially grave for infants and children under the age of 16\u201d. The suit claims that emissions remain so high that a child breathing air near certain monitors around the facility\u2019s fence line would exceed their lifetime excess cancer risk within two years.\n\nEither they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPA\nMary Hampton of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish\n\u201cIn the aggregate, the thousands of people breathing this air are incurring a significantly higher cancer risk than would be typically allowed, and they are being exposed to a much greater cancer risk from Denka\u2019s air pollution than the majority of United States residents face,\u201d the suit states.\n\nThe justice department complaint does not directly specify that Denka should reduce its emissions to the 0.2 micrograms lifetime exposure recommendation, but cites the guidance throughout the complaint.\n\nMary Hampton, another founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish, said the lawsuit was the culmination of years of advocacy from community members and represented that \u201cfinally we have a little hope\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis makes me feel like we have something to look forward to, not five or 10 years from now \u2013 we need it to happen now.\u201d\n\nHampton urged both Denka and DuPont to comply with the federal government\u2019s demands set forth in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThey know they can comply,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cAnd either they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPA.\u201d","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Tropical Storm Franklin churned through the Caribbean Sea on Monday as authorities in Haiti and the Dominican Republic warned residents to prepare for landslides and heavy floods.\n\nThe storm was centered on Monday night about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, and had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). It remained temporarily stationary, but was forecast to make a sharp turn north on Tuesday.\n\nFranklin was expected to strengthen before making landfall early Wednesday in Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm is forecast to drop up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain in both countries, with up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) in isolated areas. Heavy rainfall is of great concern to Haiti, where severe erosion in many places often leads to dangerous flooding. More than 40 people died in June following a day of heavy rain from a thunderstorm.\n\n\u201cThe mudslide risk there is just awful,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, noting that a slow-moving storm poses great danger in Haiti given that it's so stripped of trees.\n\nRecent Stories from ABC News\nSeveral Haitians in the capital of Port-au-Prince told The Associated Press that they didn't know a tropical storm was coming, despite authorities posting warnings on social media.\n\nMarie Christine Bonjour, 39, who sells used clothes, said she didn't have any preparations in place.\n\n\u201cGod is the only plan. He'll look over me and my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing I can do.\u201d\n\nThe storm approached as more than 200,000 people in Haiti are displaced, having to stay with family or in makeshift shelters because warring gangs pillaged and set fire to their homes.\n\n\u201cI hope God will direct the storm in another direction,\u201d said street vendor Anne Jean-Pierre, 45. \u201cWe can't take any more.\u201d\n\n\nJean-Pierre, who has moved twice already because of gang violence, said she would put her essential documents in a plastic bag because she lives in an area that floods easily.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire southern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A tropical storm watch was iposted for the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nEarlier Monday, there were three tropical storms swirling through the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean, an unusual occurrence as the region braces for a busier than average hurricane season.\n\n\u201cWe went from nothing to a lot in a day,\u201d Klotzbach said.\n\nOne of those storms, Emily, dissipated late Monday morning, and another storm, Gert, was downgraded to a tropical depression late Monday afternoon.\n\nRecent Stories from ABC News\nFranklin formed Sunday and was dropping heavy rain over parts of Puerto Rico on Monday, Gert formed overnight to become the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It formed some three weeks early compared with the dates of the eighth named storms from 1991 to 2020, said Brian McNoldy, senior research associated at University of Miami.\n\nThere have been 14 years with three named storms simultaneously in the Atlantic since 1886, Klotzbach said. The most storms the Atlantic has ever had at one time is four, a phenomena that has occurred only twice, in 1893 and 1995.\n\nThe Atlantic is smaller than the Pacific and can only accommodate so many storms, Klotzbach said, adding that Franklin was shearing apart Gert.\n\n\u201cOne will basically kill the other one,\u201d he said of storms that are too close to each other.\n\nMeanwhile, a fourth system in the Gulf of Mexico was expected to soon become a tropical storm, as was a system off the coast of western Africa.\n\n\n\u201cWe expected an active season,\u201d said Odalis Mart\u00ednez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Puerto Rico. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that we have several active storms.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 10, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration updated its forecast and warned that this year\u2019s hurricane season would be above normal.\n\nBetween 14 to 21 named storms are forecast. Of those, six to 11 could become hurricanes, with two to five of them possibly becoming major hurricanes, the NOAA said.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"SUNNYSIDE, Wash. \u2014 Jose Martinez has lived and worked in the United States since he was 14 years old. Now 67, he drives around the Yakima Valley in Washington state checking on fellow workers.\n\n\"When it's hot, do you have a place to protect yourself from the sun and heat?\" he calls out to some workers on the side of an apple orchard on a sunny June morning.\n\nMartinez worked in agriculture across the fields of California and, most recently, Washington state. Irrigation, grapes, apples, mushrooms, dairies and now cherries. He's done a little bit of everything.\n\n\"I love the fields because you're in the open air,\" he told NPR in his native Spanish, sitting on the lawn outside his home in Sunnyside, Wash. \"It's beautiful. I am proud to do it, to be a farmworker. Why not?\"\n\nWhen people think of farmworkers, often they think of migrant workers and labor organizers like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Now, they may add another name to those creating major changes in the farming workplace: Jose Martinez.\n\nOver the past decade, Martinez has been central to two flagship lawsuits creating policy changes in the state \u2014 making Washington one of the leaders in providing overtime to farmworkers and settling a civil rights case in favor of workers. And recently, he has taken his fight to Washington, D.C., where he has pushed for an expansion of legal status and protections for farmworkers.\n\nFederally, farmworkers are largely excluded from many federal workplace safety regulations. They don't have a right to overtime pay or to unionize, and children as young as 12 can legally work in the fields. As a result, some states, like Washington, have extended additional rights and regulations.\n\nPresident Biden came into office with the goal of expanding protections to farmworkers, including providing a pathway to legal status, overtime pay, sick leave and protection from heat exposure. But despite being the self-proclaimed most pro-labor president, his administration has faced roadblocks such as stalled nominations and legislation in Congress, and slow rulemaking, to make big changes a reality.\n\nMartinez's route to legal advocacy has not been easy\nThe Washington worker's journey to becoming an activist began nearly 14 years ago. That's when Martinez began working in a dairy.\n\n\"At that dairy is when I started to see workplace violations and abuses from the foremen to the workers,\" Martinez recalled. \"And that's when I began to do something about the rights that we have as workers in the fields.\"\n\nMartinez said that while working, he and his fellow farmworkers didn't get lunch or other breaks.\n\nSo he sought the help of Columbia Legal Services, a law firm in Washington that, in part, focuses on immigration issues.\n\n\"We began to fight and that overtime [for farmworkers] was born within the state of Washington,\" he said.\n\nThe lawsuit he filed argued that a failure to provide overtime pay violates state protections against discrimination.\n\n\"In that dairy, you had to eat with a taco in one hand and work,\" he recalled. \"There were chemicals, rats. You had to eat and run among the cows. They said it was an eight-hour shift, but sometimes it was 12. And we were not paid overtime.\"\n\nDue to a Jim Crow-era exemption in federal law, most farmworkers in the U.S. do not have the right to overtime pay.\n\nMartinez wins overtime for dairy workers in the state\nIn the fall of 2020, the Washington Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that dairy workers should be entitled to overtime pay.\n\n\"Wow, I felt so emotional,\" Martinez said, remembering how he reacted to the court's decision.\n\nThe Washington state legislature then created a law to provide overtime for all farmworkers, a phased-in process that has already begun. By 2024, farmers will have to pay workers overtime after 40 hours.\n\nOther states, including California, Colorado and New York, have passed their own laws in recent years requiring additional pay for people working on farms specifically.\n\nMartinez said not all workers have been happy with the deal. As an unintended consequence, farmers are hiring more workers to avoid paying overtime wages, resulting in lower wages overall for some longtime employees. While some advocates say they expected this to happen in some instances, Martinez told NPR he did not.\n\nThese farmworkers thought a new overtime law would help them. Now, they want it gone\n\"There are a few different points of view,\" he acknowledged, saying that some workers blame him for their now-smaller paychecks. \"But why don't we work the same long hours and get paid better? Why don't they pay us better?\"\n\nJose Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers after a COVID-19 outbreak at the mushroom farm where he was then employed and is now working with the group to form a union at the facility.\nMike Kane for NPR\nSome farmworkers want to get rid of the overtime law. Martinez sees it differently. He's going for bigger change \u2014 higher wages so that farmworkers don't feel they need to work 60 to 70 hours a week in harvest season to make enough to live on.\n\n\"I had faith that when I start something, I will finish it and it will be done,\" he said. \"I've never been afraid.\"\n\nA civil rights lawsuit rises out of a mushroom farm\nMartinez ultimately quit the dairy. He moved on to work for a fruit packing company, which he said had better working conditions. But the company closed to become a winery. In 2020, he began work only a few miles away at Ostrom Mushroom Farms, a mushroom producer later acquired by the Canadian company Windmill Farms.\n\nJust over a year after being at Ostrom, Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers, an organization that he recalled from his years on farms in the San Joaquin Valley in California. He voiced concerns over poor treatment from supervisors and went public about COVID-19 outbreaks. During those conversations Martinez tipped off a lawsuit through the state attorney general's office over gender discrimination.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the mushroom farm would pay $3.4 million to about 170 workers, resolving a lawsuit \"asserting unfair, deceptive and discriminatory actions against female farmworkers and Washington-based workers.\"\n\nFerguson told NPR that while he believes this is a case of a very bad actor, it won't be his office's last case and farmworkers are among the workers in the most difficult position to advocate for themselves.\n\n\"They may not be documented, they may not speak English, there are restrictions that make it difficult,\" Ferguson explained, as to why they may not speak up.\n\nMartinez agrees that getting workers to want to talk is a challenge.\n\n\"It was really hard at first to convince the workers [to speak up],\" Martinez said. \"First thing they said is 'they'll chase me out; I have bills to pay and a family.'\"\n\nMartinez, who has legal status, says workers who are undocumented are even more afraid to voice concerns. It is estimated that over half of all farmworkers in the U.S. are undocumented and those on visas are tied to their employers for housing, transportation and documentation.\n\n\"There is sometimes a misunderstanding about the rights that we have as workers,\" Martinez said. \"But when we are working somewhere, we do have rights to a certain extent.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, he noticed workers were arriving on seasonal H-2A visas, and women were particularly being laid off.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I told them I also have a family, but I want to stop this and what they are doing is not right \u2014 they are violating your rights as a worker and we all have rights,\" Martinez explained.\n\n\nIt's hot. For farmworkers without federal heat protections, it could be life or death\nHe's now leading a unionization effort at the mushroom farm. But should a union ever be recognized, Martinez won't be part of it. His employment was terminated on April 20 for unsatisfactory performance upon evaluation and \"no improvement in the allocated time,\" according to an employment separation form obtained by NPR.\n\nJose Martinez stands in his home in Sunnyside, Wash., on June 13. His lawsuit against an area dairy farm led to the establishment of overtime rules for farmworkers in Washington state.\nMike Kane for NPR\nHanging on the wall of his living room are certificates from Ostrom for having the best attendance just months before being laid off.\n\n\"I am proud of my roots,\" Martinez said. \"And I will keep fighting to make changes to benefit future generations.\"","labels":["None"]}

We are managing our freight procurement more efficiently and our country teams are enabled to operate more strategically,\u201d said Alexander Scheld, Global Head of Logistics at Holcim.\n\nTight margins at scale\nHolcim Group, a Swiss multinational company manufacturing building materials, supplies low-cost-per-tonne materials for construction on a large scale and procures transportation to serve its multilingual customers in over 50 countries.\n\n\nTo handle its high volume of shipments, the company used to contract thousands of trucking providers on a spot or contract basis, executing tenders manually. Each regional market worked with its own supplier base, with the effect that the country-based teams had to manually compile data to get oversight of its logistics procurement.\n\nManual processes in multiple geographies inevitably create high costs. Plus, for the head office, it was difficult to formulate a longer-term strategy across the group without having reliable rate transparency. The answer to Holcim\u2019s situation was a technology that centralized freight operations, bringing logistics suppliers & procurement decision-makers together under one \u201cdigital\u201d roof to drive a cost-effective strategy.\n\nGlobal (and regional) execution power\nThe digital freight tendering platform from SHIPSTA allowed Holcim to easily execute tenders and analyse quotes from all suppliers at a glance, gaining actionable insights and higher supply chain visibility.\n\nDecision-makers at Holcim could choose the best carriers while addressing the specific requirements of each geographical market. \u201cWe wanted everything in one place to enable seamless integration between the supplier\u2019s quote and our ability to evaluate it,\u201d said Alexander Scheld, Global Head of Logistics at Holcim.\n\nHolcim took the wise decision to transform its freight procurement country by country, ensuring the digital procurement solution was rolling out successfully across all markets and business units.\n\nAs the project proceeded, instead of manually gathering quotes from calls, emails, and messages, every freight forwarder simply responded through SHIPSTA. Hundreds of carriers were smoothly onboarded to the platform and could respond automatically to requests-for-quotation (RfQs) when they were willing (and capable) of fulfilling the criteria.\n\nThis simplified the process for Holcim as a single point of oversight visible by decision-makers in each geography. In addition to securing better prices, Holcim\u2019s country teams now save hundreds of hours, moving from days to minutes to create complex RfQs, and gain higher execution power by procuring faster and data-driven.\n\nDespite operating in multiple markets, currencies, and languages, SHIPSTA\u2019s platform integrates Holcim\u2019s full logistics portfolio globally. It provides a central dashboard from which decision-makers can see market trends, execute quickly on the best prices and ensure competitive costs. With near real-time figures at their fingertips, Holcim\u2019s procurement teams can plan more accurately and call decisions with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nSHIPSTA\u2019s investment in UX & UI design makes it user-friendly also for suppliers to sign up quickly. The platform enabled Holcim to easily invite all its suppliers and run tenders in just a few minutes.\n\n\nRead more on SHIPSTA\u2019s website to find out how the digitalization of freight procurement can bring significant advantages to any industry or enterprise and request a demo to find out how it could improve your supply chain logistics today.","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"An ice cream company based in Brooklyn has issued a recall of all flavors of its soft serve ice cream and sorbet brand after two people who ate its vanilla chocolate flavor fell sick and were sent to the hospital, according to the company and health officials. The illnesses were possibly linked to listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause serious sickness in people 65 or older and miscarriages and premature births in pregnant women, health officials said.\n\nThe company, Real Kosher Ice Cream, said in a statement on Wednesday that it would immediately recall all six flavors of its Soft Serve on the Go Cups, packaged retail versions of soft serve ice cream and sorbet. Real Kosher notified all retailers that stock the brand, asking them to remove the products from shelves and freezers and dispose of them.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Thursday about a listeria outbreak that might be linked to Soft Serve on the Go Cups.\n\nIn its own statement updated Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration said that an investigation into the outbreak was \u201congoing.\u201d The recall, the agency said, affects 19 states and the District of Columbia where the products are distributed, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Soft Serve on the Go Cups are also distributed in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Britain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAri Klein, one of the owners of Real Kosher Ice Cream, said the company was cooperating with health officials to look into the cause of the illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with them on a daily basis,\u201d Mr. Klein said, adding that the company had voluntarily recalled the entire line \u201ceven though it was only on one flavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a family-owned business, not a multibillion-dollar corporation,\u201d Mr. Klein added. \u201cAnd we felt this is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nReal Kosher said its other products, which include frozen pizzas and frozen fruit, were manufactured at a different facility and were not affected by the recall.\n\nIn a post on its official Instagram page on Thursday, the C.D.C. warned the public not to eat Soft Serve on the Go Cups, which it said had been served in at least one long-term care home.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nCovid Can Disrupt Your Sleep\n\nWhat\u2019s the Best Way to Treat Body Acne?\n\nHow Often Do Women Think About \u2026 ?\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe recall came after two customers, one in Pennsylvania and another in New York, were hospitalized between May and June after eating Soft Serve on the Go vanilla chocolate ice cream, health officials said.

{"text":"There are signs that the hot labor market is cooling \u2014 a bit. Job creation has been trending down, as have the wages posted by companies making new hires. \n\nBut it\u2019s still pretty hard for employers to find the job candidates they\u2019re looking for and pay them the going rate. National unemployment\u2019s at 3.5%, near a 50-year low. Plus, job openings still outnumber job seekers by about 1\u00bd to 1.\n\nAnother way to put this: Following all the labor disruptions early in the pandemic, we have faced stubborn labor shortages for years during the economic recovery. That\u2019s the case in multiple sectors, from the skilled trades to leisure and hospitality, from health care to high-tech. \n\nAdd demographic shifts, especially an aging workforce, and those labor shortages could be with us for a while. \n\nFrom his office on the outskirts of Chicago, Jim Piper looked down on the shop floor of his manufacturing company, Matot \u2014 where about 40 workers cut, bend and weld sheet metal to make dumbwaiters and lift systems for commercial and industrial clients.  \n\nSep 7, 2023\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to be as busy as we are, given the economic uncertainty that seems to permeate the news every evening,\u201d said Piper. \u201cWe have a strong backlog of dumbwaiter and material-lift work for new retail locations, restaurants, health care and manufacturing \u2014 many of the new semiconductor plants that are being built across the U.S.\u201d\n\nThat business is being juiced by the Joe Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, he said. But finding new skilled workers is a problem he thinks about every day.\n\n\u201cThe crisis we could see coming\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably my No. 1 issue: the so-called silver tsunami,\u201d Piper said. \u201cWe have several employees on our shop floor that have been with us for over 40 years. Which is great \u2014 they\u2019re the backbone of our manufacturing facility \u2014 but we recognize that we\u2019re going to need to replace them soon.\u201d\n\nThe demographic shift Piper\u2019s preparing for in his business has been predicted for decades. \u201cThis was the crisis we could see coming,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a consulting firm focused on small- and medium-sized businesses. \u201cThe conditions that prevailed for almost our entire lives \u2014 excess supply of labor caused by the size of the baby boom \u2014 has now come to an end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe onset of the pandemic, with the acceleration of the retirement of the boomers,\u201d Brusuelas continued, \u201chas created a confluence of events where we have a labor shortage that\u2019s verging on a crisis, that\u2019s going to cause big changes in firms, with respect to wages and flexibility, and public policy.\u201d\n\nWorkers age 25 to 54 have largely returned to the workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that group\u2019s labor force participation rate, or LFPR, was 83.4% in July 2023, up slightly from 83% in February 2020. But participation among older workers, those 55 and up, remains 1.7 percentage points lower than it was before the pandemic (38.6% in July 2023, down from 40.3% in February 2020). The LFPR for those 65 and over has fallen 1.5 percentage points.  \n\nThe COVID retirement surge\n\u201cBecause of their increased vulnerability, we saw older workers during the pandemic leave the labor force,\u201d explained Sharon Block, executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School.\n\nBlock predicted more of the same could be in store. \u201cIf we see an upsurge in the pandemic or something unexpected with COVID, I think you would expect to see that dynamic of older workers leaving the workforce again accelerate.\u201d\n\nBrusuelas pointed out that some older workers who retired early in recent years might be prodded to un-retire and return to work \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 out of economic necessity, perhaps driven by continuing inflation, dwindling savings or other financial setbacks.\n\n\u201cWe know that two-thirds of the public doesn\u2019t have $400 for a financial emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, you\u2019re going to have an ebb and a flow of those 55 and older reentering the workforce. But there\u2019s not enough of them to make a difference.\u201d  \n\nThat\u2019s because as the years go by, the wave of retiring boomers will outnumber those who return to work by a bigger and bigger margin. \n\nA reframing of \u201clabor shortages\u201d\nThat surge in retirements means labor shortages are likely to persist, driving wages up in such industries as leisure and hospitality, health care, construction and manufacturing, said Teresa Carroll, CEO of California-based workforce management firm Magnit.\n\n\u201cIn the skilled trades, the shortage is very significant,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cNursing has gone through its increase in wages because of the post-pandemic, the aging of the population and the need for more health care workers.\u201d\n\nBut are these labor shortages new? And are they really labor shortages?\n\nAfter all, employers have been complaining about not being able to find qualified workers for decades, said Erica Groshen, who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics during the Barack Obama administration and is currently senior economics adviser at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n\n\u201cWith nurses, I don\u2019t know of a time in my professional life that there hasn\u2019t been a quote-unquote \u2018shortage of nurses,\u2019\u201d Groshen said.\n\nWhat some call an economywide labor shortage, Groshen argues, is more properly seen as a failure by employers to offer high enough pay to get workers off the sidelines.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"RABAT, June 20 (Reuters) - Morocco's OCP plans to invest $7 billion in an ammonia plant using green hydrogen, produced from renewable fuel, it told Reuters, as one of the world's biggest phosphates and fertiliser companies seeks to increase output and meet low carbon goals.\n\nState-owned OCP is one of the biggest importers of ammonia, spending $2 billion on the raw material last year as the war in Ukraine pushed up global prices.\n\nThe war's impact on supplies also increased OCP's global significance and its renewables push is an important part of a Moroccan industrial strategy to reduce energy imports.\n\nTo offset supply problems, OCP has struck a deal to buy ammonia from North America this year, it said.\n\nLonger term, it plans to reinforce its domestic supply chain, including by building a plant in Tarfaya in southern Morocco.\n\nBy 2026, the plant would produce 200,000 tonnes of ammonia a year, increasing to 1 million tonnes by 2027 and 3 million tonnes by 2032, it said in an emailed answer to Reuters questions.\n\nIts plan to use hydrogen produced from solar-and-wind-powered electrolysis as a raw material to make ammonia is part of a $13 billion strategy the company announced in December to shift to renewable energy.\n\nMorocco has invested heavily in renewables, partly because it has lots of empty land, sun and wind and a long coastline, but also because it lacks oil or gas and has a difficult relationship with neighbouring hydrocarbons producer Algeria.\n\nThe government wants to raise renewable energy to 52% of installed power capacity from 38% by 2030 and is also pushing for an increase in desalination to help cities and agriculture cope with the impact of years of drought.\n\nState-owned OCP has said it plans to rely entirely on desalinated water for industrial operations by 2027 and it told Reuters it will launch tenders early next year to expand desalination capacity at Safi and Jorf Lasfar on the Atlantic.\n\nIts Tarfaya project involves a renewable-energy powered desalination plant with capacity of 60 million cubic meters a year to supply the industrial facilities.\n\nAFRICA EXPANSION\nLast year, higher prices allowed OCP to record revenues of $11.29 bln, up 40% from 2021, and net profit was $4.9 billion, up 38%. Profits have fallen this year because of lower prices, but OCP expects them to recover in the second half.\n\n\"We will ramp up our production to meet the incremental demand,\" said OCP, which has the world's biggest phosphate reserves and plans to increase fertiliser output capacity to 15 million tonnes this year and 20 million tonnes in 2027.\n\nThe company has promised to allocate 4 million tonnes of fertiliser production to the African market, where it has set up blending units and mapped soil composition across 30 million hectares to help produce customised fertilisers.\n\nOCP's investments in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, where fertiliser supply is crucial to economic development, mirror expansion by other Moroccan companies on the continent that has served to underpin increased diplomatic engagement.\n\nOCP told Reuters it would start production at its Nigeria fertilisers plant in late 2026 and in the same year launch a pre-production stage at its Ethiopia plant.","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"Akira ransomware targets Cisco VPNs to breach organizations\nBy Bill Toulas \nAugust 22, 2023 09:00 AM 0\nHacker\n\nThere's mounting evidence that Akira ransomware targets Cisco VPN (virtual private network) products as an attack vector to breach corporate networks, steal, and eventually encrypt data.\n\nAkira ransomware is a relatively new ransomware operation launched in March 2023, with the group later adding a Linux encryptor to target VMware ESXi virtual machines.\n\n\nCisco VPN solutions are widely adopted across many industries to provide secure, encrypted data transmission between users and corporate networks, typically used by remotely working employees.\n\nReportedly, Akira has been using compromised Cisco VPN accounts to breach corporate networks without needing to drop additional backdoors or set up persistence mechanisms that could give them away.\n\nAkira targets Cisco VPNs\nSophos first noted Akira's abuse of VPN accounts in May, when researchers stated that the ransomware gang breached a network using \"VPN access using Single Factor authentication.\"\n\nHowever, an incident responder, known as 'Aura,' shared further information on Twitter on how they responded to multiple Akira incidents that were conducted using Cisco VPN accounts that weren't protected by multi-factor authentication.\n\nAura tweet\n\nIn a conversation with BleepingComputer, Aura stated that due to the lack of logging in Cisco ASA, it remained unclear if Akira brute-forced the VPN account credentials or if they bought them on dark web markets.\n\nA SentinelOne report shared privately with BleepingComputer and focusing on the same attack method presents the possibility of Akira exploiting an unknown vulnerability in Cisco VPN software that might be able to bypass authentication in the absence of MFA.\n\nSentinelOne found evidence of Akira using Cisco VPN gateways in leaked data posted on the group's extortion page and observed Cisco VPN-related traits in at least eight cases, indicating this is part of an ongoing attack strategy by the ransomware gang.\n\nCisco VPN trait seen in eight Akira attacks\nCisco VPN trait seen in eight Akira attacks\nSource: SentinelOne\nRemote RustDesk access\nAdditionally, SentinelOne's analysts observed Akira using the RustDesk open-source remote access tool to navigate compromised networks, making them the first ransomware group known to abuse the software.\n\n\nBecause RustDesk is a legitimate tool, its presence is unlikely to raise any alarms, so it can offer stealthy remote access to breached computers.\n\nOther benefits that arise from using RustDesk include:\n\nCross-platform operation on Windows, macOS, and Linux, covering Akira's full targeting range.\nP2P connections are encrypted and hence less likely to be flagged by network traffic monitoring tools.\nSupports file transfer which can facilitate data exfiltration, streamlining Akira's toolkit.\nOther TTPs observed by SentinelOne in Akira's latest attacks include SQL database access and manipulation, disabling firewalls and enabling RDP, disabling LSA Protection, and disabling Windows Defender.\n\nThese not-so-subtle changes are performed after the attackers establish their presence in the environment and are ready to proceed to the final phases of their attack.\n\nIn late June 2023, Avast released a free decryptor for Akira ransomware. However, the threat actors have patched their encryptors since then, and Avast's tool will only help victims of older versions.\n","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Key takeaways:\nHome Depot and Walmart reported earnings let down investors\nThe retail giants shared full-year guidance that disappointed investors since a spending slowing down is projected for the year\nOther retail stores are expected to see rough results as earnings continue to be reported\nWell-known retail giants Home Depot and Walmart delivered a grim outlook for the future of retail spending in 2023. Home Depot\u2019s stock fell after the report, while Walmart\u2019s stock essentially flatlined as investors digested what the news meant for the economy.\n\nWalmart and Home Depot sell two different types of goods to consumers, but their reports set a precedent for the upcoming week full of earnings from other retail companies. Here\u2019s what investors might be in for.\n\nIf you want to take the guesswork out of investing, consider downloading Q.ai to diversify your portfolio and minimize risk during these uncertain economic times.\n\nWalmart, the world's largest retailer, beat analyst expectations on earnings and sales estimates in its report released Tuesday morning. However, the company announced a lackluster outlook for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nWalmart's projection predicts adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.05, which came below estimates. Additionally, net sales are predicted to grow between 2.5% and 3%.\n\nOn a call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Rainey said, \"While the supply-chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high, and there is considerable pressure on the consumer.\" He added, \"Our guidance reflects a cautious outlook on the macro environment.\u201d\n\nInvesting Digest: Know what's moving the financial markets and what smart money is buying with Forbes Investing Digest.\n\nWalmart had good news as they reported an increase in customers who make more than $100,000. The company is ready for a shift in inventory if needed since demand may change.\n\nMost consumers who shop at Walmart Supercenters or Sam's Club do so for groceries, a recession-proof good. This will help the bottom line for the company with added foot traffic.\n\nHome Depot reported its earnings for Q4 2022 and missed Wall Street's revenue expectations for the first time since November 2019. Revenue slightly fell to $35.83 billion vs. $35.97 billion expected by analysts.\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company saw increased sales as consumers took on more home projects. Now, the company sees consumers spending their discretionary income on experiences outside the house. Moving forward, the company expects sales to be approximately flat for the new fiscal year.\n\nThe dip in the housing market also contributed to lower-than-expected results. As the company does not sell \"recession-proof goods,\" it will have difficulty increasing foot traffic among regular consumers. Home Depot management will need to watch closely and interpret sales data.\n\nFuture outlook for retail giants\nWalmart and Home Depot are well-known in their respective industries, and both provide unique services to consumers. Consequently, the outlook for the two will vary throughout the year.\n\nOn the one hand, it is possible that both companies are cautious as other businesses are planning for a down market. However, the grim side is consumer spending is slowing down in the country, which may lead to a deeper recession.\n\nReuters polled economists for their opinion about the future of sales, and the data showed they forecasted sales decreasing by 0.8%. This poll was done in January as retail sales plummeted 1.1% in December.\n\nSeveral banks have reported mixed future guidance for consumers, with some seeing no change in spending and others putting away cash for future defaulted loans.\n\nThe reality is that the retail industry is currently up against several obstacles, such as supply chain issues, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, tech job layoffs and low consumer confidence in the economy. Other retailers will likely see the same problems on a bigger scale, especially those involved in apparel goods.\n\nSlowing down of spending\nAccording to the New York Federal Reserve Bank, credit card balances in the U.S. hit a new all-time high of $986 billion. Americans continue to spend, but both Walmart and Home Depot expect spending to stay flat or decline. As prices continue to increase, it is unsurprising that spending would fall among discretionary income.\n\nWalmart is in an excellent position to take advantage of consumers looking for deals to save money as prices climb. At the same time, Home Depot has a strong loyalty following from current customers, whether for home renovations or contractors.\n\nAlthough Home Depot is confident that it will do well in the upcoming environment, it is less likely as consumers will spend less for goods. Chief Financial officer Richard McPhail stated on the earnings call, \u201cDuring COVID, we saw a shift into goods. Over the last really almost two years, we\u2019ve seen a gradual shift back away from goods into services, and we think our market has reflected that, and we think that that dynamic could put some pressure on our market.\u201d\n\nWhat it means for investors\nIt could be wise for investors to move forward with caution and stay liquid in this volatile market. Long-term investors should be able to weather the storm for the retail giants and may one day see a positive return.\n\nTasked with a more difficult job, short-term investors will need to rely on data and look for signs that signal more slowdowns in consumer spending. Focusing on retail trends will also be beneficial.\n\nNumerous obstacles face the retail industry, but demand remains relatively high as consumers want to make up for lost time from the pandemic lockdown. Experiences are receiving more dollars than goods, requiring companies to be more creative to improve their bottom lines.\n\nIf Home Depot and Walmart\u2019s projections have left you uncertain about the best ways to invest, Q.ai can help you by providing artificial intelligence-powered investment strategies. Plus, with the platform's Portfolio Protection, you can rest easy knowing your investments are safeguarded in this volatile market.\n\nThe bottom line\nLast quarter, retail shopping showed signs of a slowdown in spending. As more companies release their earnings reports, further insights will be provided into different types of goods that are being impacted.\n\nWhile this information will help determine the best investment opportunities for 2023, caution should always be used before investing during these uncertain economic times.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"When we started our international coffee company in Colombia in 2017, we raised the initial capital from individual accredited investors. Instead of working with large venture capital or private equity firms, we pitched directly to high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). Back then, a focus on individual investors rather than institutions for early-stage company financing was rarer than it is today. We have found incredible strengths in this alternative funding strategy.\n\nIndividual investors want unique early-stage opportunities. For this breed of investor, a high potential for returns is non-negotiable. These investors usually demand reasonable business valuations. They require transparency and communication and are attracted by new markets and opportunities.\n\nAs U.S. citizens working in Colombia, we have since grown the Green Coffee Company into the largest producer of the country\u2019s national product\u2013coffee. To finance the business, we raised over $60 million from more than 450 individual accredited investors. This June, we raised an additional $25 million in Series-C funding\u2013a bright spot in LatAm funding according to Crunchbase.\n\nThere is an appetite for global alternative direct investments\nMany HNWIs are looking for alternative investments internationally, where they can invest directly in the companies of their choice. At the same time, these same investors often share with us their distrust of traditional private equity and venture capital firms that offer them a \u201cblind fund\u201d investment model.\n\nThe demand is there, without question, for business sponsors who can offer accredited investors the opportunity to make direct investments into businesses with high return potential in international markets. The millions in investment that we have brought to Colombia serve as evidence.\n\nInvestors want early-stage opportunities outside of tech\nWhen people hear about early-stage private company investing they think only of San Francisco and Silicon Valley. The reality is that even though they dominate the news, tech companies only make up a portion of private companies.\n\nFrom what we have seen with our investors, there is a very large pool of HNWIs who want to invest in private businesses outside of the sky-high valuations common to the tech world. Businesses with tangible assets and profits are back in style.\n\nThe sophistication of global high-net-worth investors\nWe\u2019ve seen a great amount of commentary recently arguing that investors should not need to see financial projections for early-stage companies before investing because they can never be accurate, essentially stating that financial modeling is dead.\n\n\nMuch of this mindset towards capital-raising comes from the tech sector where even the world\u2019s largest venture firms are guilty of under-diligencing companies due to their fear of missing out (or of leaving fees on the table). This is the opposite of how our investors tend to behave when deciding where to place their capital\u2013capital they often had to build a successful business themselves to obtain.\n\nHNWIs want to understand valuations and the expected financial performance of early-stage companies. Expect diligence, real diligence. Expect investors to hold company management to their forecasts post-investment, provide input, and share criticism. Investment capital must be earned.\n\nHigh returns are non-negotiable to attract capital to new jurisdictions\nTo stand out in a crowded investment landscape, businesses need to have the ability to provide superior returns. In alternative investments, total returns are by far the most important factor. Investors often penalize alternative investments due to their illiquidity as compared to publicly traded securities.\n\n\nIn the end, investors need to see a liquidity premium on their private market investments. To push outside their comfort zones and invest in individual portfolio companies at an early stage or in an emerging market, our clients want to understand how a business can reasonably achieve significant upside. In our experience, U.S. accredited investors will demand a reasonable path to 30-50% annualized returns.\n\nCapitalism has not changed as a result of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) push. Rather, our investors see ESG best practices as a means to an end. They understand a business has limited upside if ESG practices are not considered and implemented. However, presenting investments solely or predominantly on their ESG characteristics is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nCommunication is almost as important to investors as returns\nInvestors want more transparency and better communication than most traditional VC or private equity fund managers provide.\n\nQuarterly presentations to go over a plethora of portfolio companies with no depth provided (the status quo of current fund reporting) are no longer sufficient. Investors want to be able to ask investment managers questions and receive real-time answers. It sounds like an exaggeration, but we have found that there is no way to over-communicate.\n\nLeverage the opportunities that new markets present\nMany of our investors have never been presented with an investment opportunity from Latin America, a region that is oftentimes overlooked because of headlines about sky-high inflation in Argentina or the complete meltdown of Venezuela. However, these outliers are not representative of the region.\n\n\nDiscounting LATAM as uninvestable is a mistake\u2013and our investors have appreciated our contrarian approach. Investors are eager to hear new ideas from new geographies. We recommend that other founders leverage the opportunities that new markets present.\n\nMany U.S. accredited investors are ready, willing, and able to invest in new markets if the opportunity is unique and big enough to warrant their attention. There is currently a very competitive market for capital. Not all businesses will get funded, nor should they. Investors nowadays want to see real profits and reasonable valuations. We want to see more international businesses get funded. There are, however, some unbreakable rules to follow.\n\nCole Shephard is the founding partner of the alternative asset manager, Legacy Group, and the founder and a board member at the Green Coffee Company.

{"text":"Aside from the record death toll from the Ebola outbreak in Africa, businesses around the globe will be affected by the pandemic, with the mining, agricultural and energy sectors most at risk of having their businesses disrupted.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even companies that don\u2019t have operations in the affected areas might have suppliers there who have to shut down, making disruption of transportation and supply networks a potential problem for many other organizations.\n\nThe outbreak that began in Guinea and spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria had claimed more than 1,100 lives by the end of last week, prompting quarantines, flight cancellations and business disruptions.\n\n\u201cFrom a corporate risk management perspective, the issue is usually how to reduce illness and avoid business disruption,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, London-based head of population risk and data analytics research and development at Swiss Re Ltd.\n\nJohn Rose, Annapolis, Maryland-based chief operating officer of risk management information and consulting firm iJET International Inc., said travel and logistical networks are particularly sensitive to disruption by a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn area impacted by Ebola, you are seeing a serious reduction in air traffic,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cNo airline is going to fly a wide body jet to Africa if only nine passengers are aboard, so you have to have a plan B to move your assets around.\u201d\n\nQuarantines and border closings also affect employees and supply chains, said Kimberly Hale, a senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Chicago.\n\n\n\u201cCompanies need to keep in mind that if they are sending people to affected regions, borders can close at the drop of a hat,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nMining, agricultural and energy companies tend to have large operations in the African nations, so they now are bearing the brunt of the Ebola pandemic.\n\nFor example, Luxembourg-based steelmaker and mining firm ArcelorMittal S.A. last week said contractors working on expanding an iron ore mining site in Liberia had declared force majeure and were moving workers out of the country, shutting the project down.\n\nIn a statement, ArcelorMittal said it had taken steps to protect employees and operations, including providing thermoflash scanners to test employees and visitors for fevers at all its Liberia locations, personal protective equipment to hospitals and clinics, and training to health care workers and employees.\n\nJason Jarrett, Vancouver, British Columbia-based chief adviser for global business resilience, global security with Rio Tinto Group, said the London-based mining company, which has extensive operations in Guinea, put in place appropriate steps to minimize the risks when the Ebola outbreak was first detected in March.\n\nThe company enhanced medical support for its people, Mr. Jarrett said, noting that all Rio Tinto staff in Guinea receive regular briefings with the latest medical advice and those visiting are fully briefed on arrival. Rio Tinto is also providing sanitation supplies such as soap and chlorine to the communities in which its people live and work.\n\n\u201cTo support the work of the Government of Guinea and Doctors Without Borders in fighting the disease, we are distributing prevention kits, organizing public awareness campaigns and providing sanitation equipment such as shovels, rakes and refuse bins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also constructed some latrines in one of the main towns to help improve hygiene.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Jarrett said that while Rio Tinto has not stopped the movement of its people in, out or around Guinea, it is ensuring that travel is only for essential purposes.\n\nChris Baudouin, Chicago-based CEO of the Aon Global Client Network, said an aggressive employee safety approach is warranted.\n\n\u201cA lot of our clients are mining operations, which tend to have assets in remote areas and limited access to health care and transportation,\u201d Mr. Baudouin said. \u201cSo they tend to err on the side on caution, especially if airlines are shutting down flights.\u201d\n\nTo remain abreast of the situation, Susan Morton, senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Boston, said it\u2019s important for businesses to have pandemic, crisis response and business continuity plans in place, and closely follow guidance from organizations such as the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere also are also dedicated, real-time third-party risk monitoring services available.\n\nMichael Kiewski, Chicago-based director of Aon\u2019s Crisis Operations Center, said his staff provides risk managers with real-time information from the company\u2019s crisis centers in Chicago and South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are taking open information from media and social media, analyzing it and sending it out to our risk manager clients,\u201d Mr. Kiewski said. \u201cWe are watching which airlines cancel flights and which countries are shutting down borders.\u201d\n\nCompanies with workers within the affected areas also face pressure from workers\u2019 families and adverse media attention that can tarnish their corporate reputation.\n\n\u201cStranding employees exposes you to lawsuits,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real risk.\u201d\n\nCompanies that do extract employees from affected areas of Africa still need to bear in mend Ebola\u2019s lengthy incubation period and plan accordingly. \u201cYou can leave Sierra Leone or Guinea and be perfectly fine and three weeks later come down with it,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nIndeed, to reduce the risk of transmission, Mr. Jarrett said Rio Tinto has asked workers who have visited the highest-risk areas to stay at home up to 21 days before returning to work.\n\nGeoff Taylor, London-based executive director at Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. said the pandemic highlights the need for companies to focus on supply chain resiliency.\n\n\u201cYou might be able to withstand the loss of one factory, but what if you lose a key port or have an entire country subject quarantines or sanctions?\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have single-source suppliers or several concentrated in a certain region, it is good to contemplate what your options are.\u201d","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride over the last few years. All cryptocurrency is volatile with a track record of \u201cboom and bust\u201c cycles that have left many wondering whether it\u2019s safe to invest. We explain reasons for bitcoin\u2019s latest price action, along with the 2022 crypto market crash.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, dropped below $16,000 in November 2022, a year after it reached a record high of $69,000.\n\nThings started looking up in 2023, with bitcoin\u2019s price climbing above $30,000 in April. However, a rout in August wiped nearly all the gains made in the months prior. At one point the asset\u2019s price briefly fell to as low as around $25,200, down from July\u2019s high of $31,814.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind bitcoin\u2019s recent price action, and what might the future hold for the market?\n\nIn this article we explain:\n\n\nWhat is happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nWhy is the price of bitcoin going down?\nWhy did bitcoin crash in 2022?\nWhy is bitcoin so volatile?\nWill bitcoin crash or go back up?\nWhat\u2019s happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nBitcoin is incredibly volatile. It is prone to rising and falling sharply on a daily basis.\n\nIn the second half of August, the price of bitcoin fell from over $30,000 to its current level of around $26,000. This marks a decrease of around 13%, which could prove catastrophic to those holding the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency to be experiencing a tumultuous period. Generally, bitcoin\u2019s price action reflects wider market trends, with alternative cryptocurrencies known as \u2018altcoins\u2019 having a tendency to suffer in tandem with it.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is currently trading at a price of around $1,640 a coin, 10% less than a week prior.\n\nWhy has the price of bitcoin gone down?\nIt\u2019s impossible to assign a single clear cause behind bitcoin\u2019s latest dip in price, but here are some possible reasons:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk\u2019s spacecraft manufacturing company, SpaceX, may have sold part or all of its bitcoin holdings\nAnalysts expect the American central bank to keep hiking interest rates. This will make borrowing more expensive and potentially hamper spending on cryptocurrency, with investors instead favouring safer, traditional savings routes\nEvergrande, a Chinese property development giant, has recently filed for bankruptcy. There are fears that due to the size of the firm, the collapse will send ripples through the Chinese economy and hamper confidence, lowering cryptocurrency investment\nWhile inflation has fallen in several developed countries, there are still fears that it could remain historically high for some time. This can have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending on cryptocurrency\nThe cryptocurrency market has begun to face regulation in several major countries including China and United States \u2013 and therefore a stricter framework of rules. This has seen cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bittrex forced to shut down.\nBut while regulation could harm cryptocurrency prices in the short term, stricter policing of the market may give consumers greater confidence over the long run, which could see the market stabilise\nIt\u2019s not just the cryptocurrency market suffering. Global stocks have gone into a downturn as result of:\n\nThe war in Ukraine\nInflationary fears\nHigher interest rates, which have made it more expensive for businesses to borrow money\nTurbulence in the stock market has spilled over into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIs a bitcoin crash coming, or will bitcoin go back up?\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to investing, especially with cryptocurrency. As quickly as bitcoin falls, it could just as rapidly climb again.\n\nThere are a number of concerns about cryptocurrencies that are dampening its prospects:\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges going bust\nCrackdowns and heightened regulation in countries like China, the United States and the United Kingdom\nCalls for greater regulation across the globe\nEnvironmental concerns\nSecurity issues and hacks\nThe price being based solely on speculation\nFurther regulation is seen as a threat to the decentralisation of crypto, which is having an impact on the prices of digital currencies.\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is taking steps to crack down on the cryptocurrency market. This includes forcing investors to wait 24 hours after depositing money into cryptocurrency exchanges before they can access it. Find out more about the FCA\u2019s crackdown on crypto.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s actions is indicative of a wider trend of governments across the world taking the risks of cryptocurrency more seriously. If further steps are taken by regulators, we could see a fall in investment as the potential for profit in the market declines.\n\nHowever, in the long run, heightened regulation may prove fruitful for the market. This is because consumers may grow more confident with a stronger framework of rules, and a fall in volatility within the crypto market may cause them to be less fearful of losing large amounts of money.\n\nWhat are the positives of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nBitcoin\u2019s fans point to other positive qualities:\n\nTransformative technology that could revolutionise industries\nSimpler and cheaper transactions by cutting out \u201cmiddle men\u201d such as banks\nEasier global trade because, with a non-fiat digital currency, there would be no concerns about exchange rates\nTransactions are more confidential\nIt is a  safe store of value because it can\u2019t be printed or seized\nBitcoin has been touted as an alternative to gold, meaning it could prove itself as a hedge against inflation\nGiven its volatile nature, it is possible that bitcoin will gather momentum again at some point in the future (perhaps weeks, months or even years down the line, or perhaps not at all).\n\nCryptocurrency proponents will point out that given bitcoin\u2019s previous meteoric rises, it cannot be ruled out that the same could happen again.\n\nBut no one has a crystal ball and the speculative nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to predict.\n\nFind out more about the tips (and mistakes to avoid) when investing with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat caused bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2022?\nIn March 2022, the price of one bitcoin was around $46,000. But the market turbulence that followed saw this drop by nearly two thirds.\n\nIn June 2022 bitcoin dropped below $20,000 for the first time since 2020. This was prompted by the decision of Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, to freeze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions.\n\nThe move fuelled a slump across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, the most significant blow for crypto in 2022 was triggered by the collapse of FTX in November. This was a major cryptocurrency exchange which handled around $1 billion transactions each day. Its collapse had a knock-on effect on other crypto exchanges. In November 2022, the price of bitcoin fell to around $16,000, a far cry from its peak of around $65,000 a year prior.\n\nChina\u2019s continued crackdown on crypto also played a role. Transacting with or trading major cryptocurrencies is illegal there, as is \u2018mining\u2019 bitcoin \u2013 the process via which bitcoin is obtained. Find out more about how cryptocurrency works.\n\nIn addition to this, 2022 saw sudden and severe sell-offs of major cryptocurrencies. This triggered panic and further sell-offs which has knocked consumer confidence.\n\nDespite 2022 being a torrid year for bitcoin, it has since recovered some of the ground it lost last year and is now worth around $26,000.\n\nWhat were the negative stories behind bitcoin\u2019s collapse?\nNegative stories\nA number of negative stories and threats of further regulation contributed to bitcoin\u2019s collapse in 2022.\n\nThese included:\n\nNovember 2022 cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bust\nJune 2022, Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, froze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions\nJune 2022, Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, paused bitcoin withdrawals, blaming a \u201cstuck transaction\u201d that was causing a backlog\nEarly 2022, reports that Russia might ban cryptocurrency operations. After the invasion of Ukraine, there were calls for crypto exchanges to ban Russian transactions.\nMay 2021, Tesla boss Elon Musk said that the electric car maker would no longer be accepting digital payments over environmental concerns\nJune 2021, banks and payment institutions in China were told to stop enabling crypto transactions, and the Chinese government banned the mining of the currencies. Then in September 2021, all crypto transactions were declared illegal\nJune 2021, then US president Donald Trump described bitcoin as a \u201cscam\u201d competing against the dollar to be \u201cthe currency of the world\u201d\nFBI agents have seized millions of dollars in bitcoin from criminals over the years.\nAugust 2021, UK regulator the FCA in effect blacklisted Binance. Big banks such as HSBC and Santander blocked customers from making payments to Binance.\nAugust 2021, the International Monetary Fund warned the widespread use of crypto would threaten \u201cmacroeconomic stability\u201d and could harm financial integrity.\nWhat were the positive stories behind crypto\u2019s rise in 2021?\nThere have also been more positive stories and these have given the bitcoin price some protection over the past couple of years, as well as propelling bitcoin to its peak of around $65,000 in November 2021:\n\nMarch 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first big US bank to offer wealthier clients access to bitcoin funds \u2013 albeit restricted to no more than 2.5% of an investor\u2019s total net worth.\nJune 2021, a month after sparking a crypto sell-off, Elon Musk said Tesla would probably accept bitcoin payments again when more than 50% of its energy usage came from renewable sources.\nJuly 2021 Amazon posted a job advert for a \u201cdigital currency and blockchain product lead\u201d prompting speculation that it would soon accept bitcoin as payment.\nSept 2021 El Salvador become the first country to make bitcoin legal tender\nOther stories have been more mixed in terms of what they mean for cryptocurrencies.

{"text":"More generous unemployment benefits doled out during the pandemic appear to have been a magnet for fraud, according to a government watchdog report released on Tuesday.\n\nAs much as $135 billion of the roughly $900 billion in benefits claimed between April 2020 and May 2023 \u2014 about 15 percent \u2014 was likely illegally claimed, the Government Accountability Office said on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the coronavirus shut down much of the economy, the federal government extended and expanded unemployment benefits to help keep millions of Americans who lost their jobs financially afloat. But the sheer demand for aid and the need for states \u2014 which administer payments \u2014 to quickly roll out new relief programs increased the risk of fraud.\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the full scope of the fraud \u201cwill likely never be known with certainty.\u201d\n\nThe expanded unemployment benefits were part of trillions in relief money sent to individuals and businesses after the onset of the pandemic. In the federal government\u2019s haste to get relief money out the door, much of it was distributed with few strings attached and little oversight. That has led to a flood of criminals taking advantage of seemingly easy ways to obtain free money. Federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents have since deployed various methods to try to catch fraudsters and recoup billions.\n\nThe Labor Department, which oversees federal unemployment insurance programs, expressed concerns about the report\u2019s methodology and argued that the level of fraud was likely overstated. Officials pointed to efforts that have since been taken to deter fraud, and said the \u201cenormous task\u201d of doling out the funds was made \u201conly more daunting by the decades-long chronic underfunding\u201d of the unemployment benefits system.\n\n\u201cAs a result, state agencies were unprepared for the extraordinary spike in the number of claims to be processed each week,\u201d Brent Parton, a principal deputy assistant secretary at the department, wrote in the letter.\n\nLast month, Justice Department officials announced that the federal government had charged 3,195 defendants with offenses related to pandemic fraud and seized more than $1.4 billion in relief funds. That came after the department carried out a three-month \u201csweep\u201d to combat Covid-19 fraud, which ended in July and involved more than 50 U.S. attorney\u2019s offices and dozens of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nSome of those charged have been accused of stealing millions in pandemic unemployment benefits after submitting fraudulent applications. In one case, prosecutors said, individuals used the funds to solicit a murder for hire and to purchase firearms, controlled substances, jewelry, clothing and vacations.\n\nInvestigations into potential fraud are still ongoing. According to a June report from the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General, about 163,000 investigations related to unemployment benefits paid during the pandemic were still open.\n\nIn February, the office estimated that at least $191 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits could have been made improperly, with a significant amount attributable to fraud.\n\nPandemic relief for small businesses was also targeted by fraudsters. The Small Business Administration\u2019s inspector general has estimated that more than $200 billion \u2014 or at least 17 percent of the roughly $1.2 trillion in pandemic loans the agency doled out \u2014 was disbursed to \u201cpotentially fraudulent actors.\u201d","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Amazon\n warehouses are a more dangerous place to work than comparable facilities, new federal injury data shows.\n\nIn 2022, there were 6.6 serious injuries for every 100 Amazon workers, according to a report released Wednesday from the union coalition Strategic Organizing Center, which relies on data submitted by Amazon to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. That\u2019s more than double the rate of all non-Amazon warehouses, which had 3.2 serious injuries for every 100 workers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s serious injury rate fell by about 3% between 2021 and 2022. The rate shot up to 6.8 serious injuries for every 100 workers in 2021, compared to a rate of 5.9 serious injuries for every 100 workers in 2020. Amazon previously attributed the jump to a warehouse hiring push during the pandemic.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has significantly pared its head count in the last year as it acknowledged it hired too many workers, as CEO Andy Jassy looks to cut costs across the company. Amazon had 1.54 million employees globally at the end of the fourth quarter, down 4% from the year-earlier period.\n\nThe SOC report argues that Amazon has \u201cnot made meaningful progress\u201d on its total rate of injuries or serious injuries between 2017 and 2022, the six-year period in which it has data. Until 2020, OSHA did not release full injury and illness records submitted by employers, claiming that more detailed logs contained confidential commercial information. That changed after a lawsuit filed by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and labor group Public Citizen forced OSHA to release the data.\n\nWhile Amazon\u2019s serious injury rate fell between 2021 and 2022, its overall injuries increased. Amazon reported 39,000 total injuries at its U.S. facilities in 2022, up from 38,300 total injuries in 2021.\n\nThe data suggests that injuries experienced by workers at the company are more frequent and severe than other warehouse workers, SOC said. In 2022, Amazon was responsible for more than half of all serious injuries in the warehousing industry, while making up 36% of its workers, according to the report.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the SOC\u2019s findings \u201cpaint an inaccurate picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe safety and health of our employees is, and always will be, our top priority, and any claim otherwise is inaccurate,\u201d Nantel said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the progress made by our team and we\u2019ll continue working hard together to keep getting better every day.\u201d\n\nAmazon also disputed the SOC\u2019s use of the term \u201cserious injury rate,\u201d saying it\u2019s not a regulatory metric. The company said the term could capture any injury that could lead to an employee taking time away from work, or spending time working in another role, including what it considers to be minor injuries, such as a strain that might require a worker to avoid lifting heavy boxes.\n\nAmazon claims its lost time incident rate, which measures the number of incidents that require workers to take time off, is below the warehousing industry average.\n\nLabor advocates have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s workplace safety record in their efforts to organize its facilities. Employees continue to point to the company\u2019s productivity demands and the strenuous nature of the job as a catalyst behind high injury rates. Several states including New York, Washington and California have passed laws taking aim at Amazon\u2019s work quotas.\n\nFederal inspectors have repeatedly levied fines against the company at several facilities over various safety violations. OSHA cited Amazon at six of its warehouses for failing to report workplace injuries and exposing workers to ergonomic hazards. Those citations followed inspections by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York at multiple sites, and the office\u2019s probe is ongoing.\n\nLast March, the state of Washington\u2019s Department of Labor and Industries cited Amazon\u2019s flagship facility in Kent, Washington, over unsafe work practices. The agency found that many Amazon jobs involve \u201crepetitive motions, lifting, carrying, twisting, and other physical work\u201d and said workers are required to perform these tasks \u201cat such a fast pace that it increases the risk of injury.\u201d\n\nAmazon has appealed the fines and in October filed a lawsuit against the agency, asking a judge to set aside the orders to reduce hazards on the grounds that they violate the due process protections under the 14th Amendment.\n\nAmazon said it doesn\u2019t have fixed quotas, but that it has performance expectations \u201clike any business.\u201d The company said it investigates any reports of managers misusing productivity guidance.\n\nThe SDNY, a division of the Department of Justice, is also investigating whether Amazon made \u201cfalse representations\u201d to lenders about its workplace safety record to obtain credit.\n\nAmazon said it will appeal the OSHA citations. It also said it disagrees with the SDNY\u2019s allegations.\n\nThe company has previously defended its safety record, and it says it plans to invest $550 million on safety initiatives in 2023, after spending roughly $1 billion on improving safety between 2019 and 2022.\n\nJassy has said Amazon\u2019s injury rates are \u201csometimes misunderstood,\u201d but he acknowledged Amazon can do more to improve safety inside its facilities. In 2021, Amazon set a goal to halve its warehouse injury rate by 2025.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021 pledged to make the company \u201cEarth\u2019s Best Employer\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.\u201d Shortly afterward, Amazon rolled out WorkingWell, a series of programs designed to prevent workplace injuries in its warehouses by encouraging stretching and healthy eating habits, among other things.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Christopher Kubasik, CEO of L3Harris Technologies, said Jan. 27 regulators continue to review the company\u2019s proposed $4.7 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and expects the merger to close in 2023.\n\nL3Harris, headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, is a global defense and aerospace firm with more than $17 billion in annual revenue. In December it announced an agreement to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne, a California-based manufacturer of rocket engines and propulsion systems for space vehicles, ballistic missiles and military tactical weapons. \n\nDuring a fourth-quarter earnings call, Kubasik said the company has been answering questions from Federal Trade Commission antitrust regulators. He said L3Harris executives have met with Pentagon officials to address questions on the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its potential impact on defense programs. \n\nKubasik did not comment on a recent letter sent by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to the Federal Trade Commission urging the agency to block the transaction. The FTC last year blocked Lockheed Martin\u2019s proposed $4.4 billion bid for Aerojet Rocketdyne, arguing that the combination would give Lockheed \u2014 a major supplier of tactical missiles \u2014 the ability to \u201ccut off other defense contractors from the critical components they need to build competing missiles.\u201d\n\nL3Harris said it does not expect to face these same challenges because the combination with Aerojet would be a \u201chorizontal move\u201d rather than a vertical integration of a missile manufacturer and a key supplier of propulsion systems. \n\nIf the acquisition is approved, Kubasik said, there are no plans to close major facilities but he estimates about $50 million in overhead cost savings during the first year. \u201cWe both have offices in D.C. We both have offices in Huntsville. There\u2019s some low hanging fruit there,\u201d he said. \n\nThis would be L3Harris\u2019 second of two back-to-back acquisitions. Earlier this month the company closed a nearly $2 billion purchase of Viasat\u2019s tactical data links business. \n\n\u201cWe got TDL done in 92 days, and the integration is already underway, so we can focus on getting Aerojet Rocketdyne approved, and then start the integration,\u201d said Kubasik.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t foresee us doing any acquisitions for a couple of years, as you would imagine,\u201d he told analysts. \u201cThere\u2019s some non-core assets that we\u2019re going to sell, and we\u2019re going to use those proceeds to bring down our debt over the next few years.\u201d","labels":["None"]}

The cuts mainly focus on Amazon Web Services, advertising, Twitch, human resources and its stores divisions.\n\nAmazon Jumps Into Artificial Intelligence\nOn April 13, Amazon jumped into the booming field of generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind ChatGPT. Amazon stock climbed on the news, as did other AI companies.\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) previously announced plans to bring ChatGPT to the public. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, plans to target corporate customers.\n\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI software more efficiently and cheaper than competitors can.\n\n\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But it's only been the last five to 10 years that it's started to be used more pervasively by companies,\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\n\nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence.\n\nJassy went on to say: \"We will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\"\n\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have moved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on the booming interest in artificial intelligence technology.\n\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA, maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\n\n\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook, especially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe investors will appreciate Amazon's heightened focus on cost savings and free cash flow,\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on earnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-commerce giant.\n\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4 billion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the prior quarter\n\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed. \"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully profitable,\" he said in his note to clients.\n\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical, giving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well as lab tests and programs for preventive care.\n\n\"We're on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to find, choose, afford and engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay healthy,\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a written statement with the Amazon news release.\n\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid about $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship prescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400 billion pharmacy business.\n\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health care, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\n\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or sell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identifies lower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\n\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential, based on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.\n\nAmazon's Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for stocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\n\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been recovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\n\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price action is so far pretty smooth.\n\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could retard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\n\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a resistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line. Falling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then piercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\n\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines. IBD offers a broad range of growth stock lists, such as Leaderboard and SwingTrader.\n\nInvestors also can create watchlists, find companies nearing a buy point, or develop custom screens at IBD MarketSmith.","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"Minneapolis\nCNN\n \u2014 \nThe pandemic dislodged the global supply chain, hurling once smoothly running businesses, industries and economies into a state of disarray.\n\nAfter almost three years of enduring wild swings and extremes, the system is slowly getting up to speed and into better sync: Ocean freight timelines are on a steady decline, ports are less congested, labor strikes have been narrowly averted, product and worker shortages have eased, prices have fallen, warehouses are full (maybe too full), friendshoring, nearshoring and reshoring efforts have accelerated and China has lifted its \u201czero Covid\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a fundamental shift that started about six months ago,\u201d said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management. \u201cThere are certain components, like integrated circuits [and] microcontrollers, that still are impacting manufacturers\u2019 ability to flow material. But, by and large, the pressure has come off.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, plenty of potential roadblocks still loom large.\n\nGlobally, developments in China and Ukraine remain ongoing question marks, especially if the manufacturing megapower suffers another setback or lockdown, or if conditions worsen with Russia\u2019s war in Europe.\n\nDomestically, exports have weakened and the state of consumer demand remains a wild card, said Phil Levy, chief economist with freight forwarder and consultancy firm Flexport.\n\n\u201cI would not describe this as a machine that\u2019s humming along at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more getting its bearings and trying to figure out what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nAmong the potential bottlenecks: Warehousing capacity in certain locales, notably Southern California, is pretty near full, he said. Additionally, the inland distribution network \u2014 especially rail and areas where transfers are made from one mode to another \u2014 has experienced some challenges, he said.\n\nThe system isn\u2019t yet at a steady state where businesses have a good sense of how long it will take for production, shipping and, ultimately, selling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have that,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about how long it takes to move stuff. When we see the warehouses piled full, is this because demand is too low? Is it because people moved stuff too early? So there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s still sorting out.\u201d\n\nReturning to normal\nSupply chain activity has yet to normalize, but it\u2019s returning to pre-pandemic trajectories, said Zac Rogers, assistant professor of operations and supply chain management at Colorado State University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of reaction-overreaction pattern that always tends to happen anytime there\u2019s a major disruption,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cAnd Covid is the major-est disruption we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nEarly in the pandemic, businesses canceled orders, believing consumer spending would be crushed. However, trillions of dollars were injected into the economy to try to keep consumers and businesses afloat. Americans, stuck at home with fewer outlets for discretionary spending, turned to e-commerce for their shopping.\n\nThe surge in demand for finished goods at a time when supply was severely limited in part due to pandemic-related labor shortages and shutdowns \u2014notably of cities, factories and manufacturing hubs in China \u2014 knocked the global logistics system out of whack.\n\nPorts grew congested, lead times got lengthy, and costs climbed considerably higher as shortages spiked throughout the supply chain.\n\n\u201cEveryone way over-ordered, and around February and March of [last] year, everything got here \u2014 pretty much right in time for the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nVCG\/VCG\/Getty Images\nGas prices and inflation soared, putting a huge dent in consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the last 10 months in supply chains has been to try to thread the needle between bringing inventories down to a reasonable level, while also not overreacting, yet again, and [landing] back into a shortage situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting back toward the trend line in a way that we haven\u2019t in the last few years.\u201d\n\nReshoring and smoother flows\nHelping that along is that supply chains are far more resilient now than they were at the end of 2019, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we had basically all of our chips in on one hand, which was, things are built in East Asia, come on a boat through the ports in Southern California, they get on trains that go to Chicago and then on other trains or trucks to distribute to the East Coast,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s nearly impossible to divorce from China, companies are embracing different paths for the supply chain, whether it be in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Central America or domestically, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cBecause of that, supply chains are not as brittle as they were three years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so if there is another shock \u2014 particularly if there\u2019s a China-centric shock \u2014 I think we\u2019ll be able to absorb it a little better than we had. \u2026 But you can\u2019t price in something like the invasion of Ukraine or a viral outbreak that shuts down the world \u2014 no systems are built to handle that smoothly.\u201d\n\nRogers is also a researcher and co-author of the Logistics Managers\u2019 Index, a monthly survey of supply chain executives conducted by a team of university researchers and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals.\n\nThe index\u2019s December reading \u2014 which measures inventory levels and costs; warehousing capacity; utilization and prices; and transportation capacity, utilization and prices \u2014 came in at 54.6, a 1-point increase following eight months of declines.\n\nThe majority of the LMI metrics were in the range of 40s, 50s and 60s, Rogers said, noting it\u2019s the first time since the onset of the pandemic that the indices haven\u2019t been in the 70s or 80s.\n\nThe container ship Ever Libra (TW) is moored at the Port of Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 21, 2022. The supply backlogs of the past two years -- and the delays, shortages and outrageous prices they brought with them -- have improved dramatically since summer. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in 40, that\u2019s contraction, but 50s are normal, healthy rates of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be another huge black swan event in a month that throws everything upside down; but for right now, it seems like respondents are predicting steadiness in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nIf anything, the pandemic\u2019s shock to the supply chain should be a wake-up call, said Jack Buffington, director of supply chain and sustainability at First Key Consulting and assistant professor of supply chain management at the University of Denver.\n\n\u201cI would categorize it as \u2018efficiently broken,\u2019\u201d said Buffington, whose own book about supply chains, \u201cReinventing the Supply Chain: A 21st Century Covenant with America,\u201d had its release delayed due to supply chain issues.\n\n\u201cAll supply chains really are is supply and demand, and there\u2019s been so much disruption in materials and consumer demand related to labor and inflation and geopolitics,\u201d he said. \u201cInherently, the foundation of the model is broken in comparison to what the demands are for today. The complexities related to a globalized supply chain, human systems aren\u2019t capable of handling it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCovid wasn\u2019t the cause of the problems with the supply chain, it was a trigger to show how bad it was,\u201d he said.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"At almost any migrant shelter in New York it's easy to see men \u2014 sitting on curbs or park benches \u2014 waiting. Eddie is one of those people, sitting under a highway overpass, eating a lunch of rice and chicken. He asked that his last name be withheld, because he says he's fleeing violence between armed groups in Colombia.\n\nEddie wants to apply for asylum but more immediately, he just wants to work. Like so many migrants, he keeps getting asked for work papers. The fact that he doesn't have them, he says, keeps him up at night.\n\nIt's not just Eddie who wants Eddie to work. Lawmakers around the country have been pressing the federal government to expedite work papers for asylum-seekers. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul last Thursday publicly criticized the Biden administration for lack of action on immigration. Her remarks echoed those of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who said recently, \"We must expedite work authorization for asylum-seekers, not in the future, but now.\"\n\nAdams has been one of the loudest voices on the matter: New York has received around 100,000 migrants seeking shelter. Chicago and Boston \u2014 also recipients of thousands of people \u2014 have joined the request.\n\n\"Outside of periods of crushing recessions, labor is always our biggest challenge,\" Grams says. \"It's been frustrating for him to watch thousands of migrants arrive in Chicago, and just wait for permission to work.\"\n\nAnyone who has tried and failed to get a landscaper to call them back in the spring, he says, now knows the reason why.\n\nGiving migrants easier access to work permits, adds Grams, would also push him to create more jobs for U.S. citizens. If he had the labor force to take on more projects he could \"hire an account manager, a production manager, a construction supervisor, a designer. Hire more domestic workers.\"\n\nDespite all the enthusiasm for quicker work permits, there's a lot of entrenched obstacles. The application process, for one, can be incredibly confusing. \"Not everyone understands how to navigate the immigration process as soon as they get here,\" says Conchita Cruz, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project.\n\nTake someone like Eddie \u2014 the Colombian migrant sitting under the highway overpass. He has a year to figure out how to submit an asylum application, which he says he finds daunting. He has to tackle that while also figuring out what he'll do in 60 days when he can no longer stay at a shelter. Given the current situation in New York, it's likely he'll have a hard time finding a lawyer to help him. \"That's what a lot of the backup is,\" says human rights law professor Susan Gzesh from the University of Chicago. \"The pro-bono panels are staffed. Nonprofits, all sorts of volunteers, are really at capacity.\"\n\nOnce Eddie applies, he has to wait another 150 days to submit a work permit application and then another 30 days to get approved.\n\nEddie is at the very least facing half a year without legal permission to work.\n\nThis is the norm, Cruz says. \"It does take at least six months, if not significantly longer, to get a work permit.\" That, she says, can have a massive impact on migrants themselves. \"A lot of the asylum-seekers who are coming to the United States are parents of young kids. They have a family to support. And work permits are not just a path to getting a job, but in the United States, they really unlock a number of things like a driver's license; the ability to access health care insurance \u2014 things that American citizens take for granted.\"\n\nThere is proposed legislation to expedite work permits for asylum-seekers. But experts say, Congress is just too divided to pass it.\n\nThat legislation wouldn't address one of the major problems in getting work permits approved quicker: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, funded by Congress, is completely backed up. \"They just don't have enough staff to do it,\" Cruz says. \"Some of these backlogs are now many years old. So they're backlogs that existed even before COVID. There was a huge slowdown in processing during the Trump administration. \"\n\nThere are also difficult questions around fairness, says Muzaffar Chishti, a director at the Migration Policy Institute. There are around 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., many who've been here for decades and have no way to get a work authorization. \"So to say these recent arrivals have more privilege than them, is an equity issue that is difficult to argue.\"\n\nIn a statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security said it continues to \"call on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nThere are, however, some things the president could do on his own. He could extend TPS \u2014 temporary protected status \u2014 to more people. That allows people to apply for work permits faster. He could grant humanitarian parole to more people, although his efforts to do so are currently on trial. And he could also tell Immigration Services to prioritize work permits.\n\nEven then, backlogs would be an issue.\n\nTaking any of these actions could be too much of a political hot potato, especially with an election on the horizon. \"I think that they are very cautious about doing anything that could be characterized as an incentive for more unauthorized migration,\" says professor Gzesh.\n\n\nThe application process for work authorization takes so long that many migrants have started working without papers, at high-risk, low-pay jobs like food delivery.\nJasmine Garsd\/NPR\nMeanwhile, without the ability to legally work, many migrants are being pushed into the underground economy. Angel, from Venezuela, is also hoping to apply for asylum. He asked that his last name be withheld. One reason: He's renting out someone's identity, so that he can work delivering food. He says he asked around for work \"but they ask you for a Social Security number, an ID, so many things I don't have. So I just rent an account out and can work in peace. It's the most logical move for people like us, without papers.\"\n\nAngel works around 12 hours a day. A significant portion of what he makes goes to the person he rents his online profile from. What's left is not a lot. It goes mostly to his family back home.\n\nIt's better than nothing \u2014 but barely enough.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"The Covid-19 pandemic and recent Russia-Ukraine war disrupted global supply chains and led to significant delivery delays, input shortages, and stockout risks. Firms exposed to such risks have been forced to rethink their production and inventory management from just-in-time to just-in-case. Using quarterly Japanese firm-level data, this column shows that relative to firms that purchase inputs only domestically, importers significantly and persistently increased their inventories of intermediate inputs. This suggests the possibility of a shift from just-in-time to just-in-case production after the pandemic.\n\nHongyong Zhang\nSenior Fellow Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI)\n\n\nThi Thanh Ha Doan\nEconomist Economic Research Institute For Asean And East Asia (ERIA)\n\nInventory plays an important role in international trade. Because of delivery lags and lumpy trade, importers face severe inventory management problems. It is reported that importing firms have approximately twice the inventory of firms that purchase materials only domestically (e.g. Alessandria et al. 2010). Supply chain disruptions during the pandemic have garnered attention from researchers and policymakers regarding the role of inventory as a buffer against input shortages. The previous study shows that among French firms exposed to the Chinese lockdown, those holding more inventories ex-ante performed better in the aftermath of the shock (Lafrogne-Joussier et al. 2022). Furthermore, Alessandria et al. (2023) examine the aggregate effects of supply-chain disruptions in the post-pandemic period and show that firms optimally hold inventories that depend on the source of supply, whether domestic or imported. However, little is known about global sourcing and inventory adjustments to supply chain shocks at the firm level.\n\nFigure 1 shows the quarterly movements in Japan\u2019s manufacturing production and inventory ratio indices (seasonally adjusted) from Q1 2015 to Q2 2022. Manufacturing production was disrupted during Q1-Q2 2020 after the Japanese government took its first emergency measures in April-May in major economic regions. Meanwhile, inventories increased substantially, and their magnitudes were much larger than the decline in production. The inventory ratio declined quickly after Q2 2020 but it increased again after early 2021. It is worth noting that the inventory ratio remains persistently high even though production recovered by 2021. In early 2022, the inventory ratio further increased, probably because of the Shanghai lockdown and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nFigure 1 Production disruption and increasing inventories in manufacturing industries\n\nFigure 1 Production disruption and increasing inventories in manufacturing industries\nNotes: Inventory ratio is the producer\u2019s inventory ratio of finished goods (= inventory quantity \/ shipment quantity). The year 2015 was standardised at 100. The indices were seasonally adjusted.\nSource: Indices of Industrial Production (IIP), Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).\nMotivated by this, in a recent paper (Zhang and Doan 2023) we explore a large-scale quarterly government survey of Japanese manufacturing firms over the period Q1 2015\u2013Q2 2021 and examine firm-level inventory adjustments to supply chain shocks during the pandemic, focusing on firms that source inputs globally. Our data contain detailed quarterly information on each firm\u2019s inventory of materials and supplies, work-in-process products, and finished goods. Japanese firms are famous for their well-organised just-in-time production systems and international production networks. Thus, they provide an ideal setting for studying firm-level responses (i.e. inventory adjustments) to supply chain shocks.\n\nImporters increase inventories after the pandemic\nWe first show that before the pandemic, relative to firms that purchase inputs only domestically, importing firms tend to have higher inventory ratios (inventories over sales) and stocks in materials and supplies, work-in-process (intermediate goods), and finished goods, even controlling for firm size. While this relationship has been documented by Alessandria et al. (2010) for Chilean firms, we show that it is also present for Japanese manufacturing firms.\n\nAfter the pandemic, relative to non-importers, importers significantly and persistently increased their total inventories (Figure 2) and inventories in materials and supplies, work-in-process, and finished goods, respectively (Figure 3). Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are substantial heterogeneities across all three types of inventories within each industry. For example, in the automobile industry, with prevailing just-in-time production and inventory management, work-in-process inventories (intermediate goods) exhibited a sharp increase during the pandemic, suggesting the importance of parts and components in this industry. These results suggest the possibility of a shift from just-in-time to just-in-case production during the pandemic.\n\nFigure 2 Importers increase their inventories after the pandemic\n\nFigure 2 Importers increase their inventories after the pandemic\nNotes: This figure plots the estimates of the importer-time dummy variables for the period from Q1 2015 to Q2 2021, controlling for firm size, industry-time, and region-time fixed effects.

Dotted lines represent the 95% confidence intervals.\nImport reliance and supply chain disruptions\nWe show that importers significantly and persistently increased their inventories, especially for firms with ex-ante higher import share and (multinational) firms that experienced supply chain disruptions in China. Figure 4 shows the relationship between ex-ante import share (defined as the average share of imported inputs in total sourcing from 2015 to 2019) and inventory ratio for the pre-Covid and post-Covid samples. There is a strong positive correlation between ex-ante import share and inventory ratio in both pre-Covid and post-Covid periods. Firms tended to increase their inventory holdings after the pandemic, especially those that relied heavily on imported inputs.\n\nFigure 4 Inventories significantly increase with ex-ante imports after the pandemic\n\nFigure 4 Inventories significantly increase with ex-ante imports after the pandemic\nNotes: This figure plots the relationship between the ex-ante firm import share (imported inputs in total sourcing) and inventory ratio in the pre-COVID (Q1 2015 \u2013 Q4 2019) and post-COVID (Q1 2020 \u2013 Q2 2021) periods, controlling for industry-time and region-time fixed effects. Each dot indicates a bin of firm observations.\nFigure 5 shows the relationship between supply chain disruptions and ex-post inventory holdings. The horizontal axis represents the year-on-year changes in foreign affiliates\u2019 exports to Japan in Q1 2020, and the vertical axis represents parent firms\u2019 inventories after Q2 2020. The red triangles and fitted lines show that the lower the growth of exports to Japan by manufacturing affiliates in China in Q1 2020, the larger the inventories held by parent firms after Q2 2020. In other words, Japanese multinationals that experienced a sharp drop in sourcing inputs from China tended to increase their inventories after supply chain shocks. In contrast, the blue dots and fitted line show the opposite pattern: the higher the growth of exports to Japan by manufacturing affiliates in other countries in Q1 2020, the larger the inventories held by their parent firms after Q2 2020. These results suggest that supply chain disruptions during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic had a large and persistent effect on importer inventory management.\n\nFigure 5 Supply chain disruptions in China led to an increase in inventories after the shock\n\nFigure 5 Supply chain disruptions in China led to an increase in inventories after the shock\nNotes: This figure plots the relationship between the y-o-y changes in foreign affiliates\u2019 exports to Japan in Q1 2020 and parent firms\u2019 inventory ratios during Q2 2020 \u2013 Q2 2021, controlling for industry-time and region-time fixed effects. Each dot indicates a bin of parent firm observations.\nWe further consider the potential factors affecting inventories, including the industry upstreamness in the production network, the prefecture-level severity of the Covid-19 infections, industry-level input and output prices, firm-level financial constraints, and firm-level uncertainties over economic and business outlooks. Even controlling for these factors, results show that importers always tend to hold more inventories relative to importers after the pandemic.\n\nConcluding remarks\nOur study is expected to provide policy implications for the debate on the robustness and resilience of supply chains by providing evidence of firm-level adjustments to supply chain shocks and the relationship between global sourcing and inventory holdings. Relative to firms that exclusively purchase inputs domestically, importing firms tend to hold larger inventories, even when controlling for firm size. More importantly, after the pandemic, importers reacted to potential input shortages by increasing their inventories of materials and suppliers, intermediate inputs, and finished goods. This is more prominent for firms with higher ex-ante import share and multinational firms that experienced supply chain disruptions in China. These results suggest the possibility of a shift from just-in-time to just-in-case production after the pandemic. Note that due to data constraints, we cannot observe whether a firm adopts just-in-time or just-in-case inventory. However, firms that rely heavily on imported inputs, and firms that experience supply chain disruptions do increase their inventories of intermediate inputs after the pandemic despite large carrying costs.\n\nInventories can act as buffers against supply chain disruptions and input shortages during pandemics and other supply chain shocks. However, increasing inventory is accompanied by increasing costs, which are crucial for firms with financial constraints. Thus, policies that relax financial constraints are required, especially for firms relying on international supply chains and imported inputs. More importantly, policies in the post-pandemic era should support business efforts to build robust and resilient supply chains. It is also worth noting that because our sample period is until Q2 2021, it is premature to conclude that manufacturing firms have completely shifted from just-in-time to just-in-case production. It is necessary to monitor firm-level inventory adjustments and the macroeconomic inventory cycle.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}
{"text":"Aug 31 (Reuters) - India's economy grew at its fastest pace in a year in the June quarter, supported by strong services activity and robust demand, data released by the government showed on Thursday.\n\nGross domestic product expanded 7.8% on an annual basis in the April to June quarter, accelerating from the 6.1% growth recorded in the March quarter and topping a 7.7% forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nIt was also the highest reading since the equivalent period of 2022, when growth stood at 13.1%.\n\nCOMMENTARY:\n\nRADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE\n\"The economy's growth at 7.8% in 1QFY24 was amongst the fastest versus its regional peers, benefitting by a sharp jump in the government capex expenditure, firm services momentum and better consumption, besides a favourable base. External trade was in a soft spot, reflecting the impact of weak global forces. A strong growth print provides the room for the RBI to be focused on anchoring inflationary expectations.\"\n\nVIVEK KUMAR, ECONOMIST, QUANTECO RESEARCH, MUMBAI\n\"Acceleration in India's GDP growth to 7.8% Y\/Y in Q1FY24 is along expected lines. This was single-handedly driven by recovery in private consumption, even as other demand side drivers showed moderation. Meanwhile, reflecting slowdown in global trade, exports contracted on annualized basis for the first time in 10 quarters.\n\n\"On the supply side, services continue to outpace industry performance with strong traction in contact-intensive activities along with finance and real estate services.\"\n\n\"While this is comforting, we do believe Q1 would mark the peak in near term growth trajectory, with successive quarterly numbers printing lower. We maintain our FY24 GDP growth to moderate to 6.0% (with a mild upside risk) from 7.2% in FY23 on account of lagged impact of past monetary tightening, adverse spillover from global slowdown, uncertainty related to monsoon performance, and waning of pent-up demand.\"\n\nMADHAVI ARORA, LEAD ECONOMIST, EMKAY GLOBAL, MUMBAI\n\"While the April-June quarter growth print is in line with our expectations, the growth mix was a bit of a surprise. Ideally, the Y\/Y fall in commodity prices should have boosted manufacturing firms' operating profits and thereby lifted the value-added-growth of manufacturing sector. Thus, the disappointment on that front was surprising.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, strong government capex and credit growth expectedly led to double-digit construction sector growth and financial services growth respectively. While we retain our FY24E GDP growth at sub 6%, we recognise economic activity recovery is not yet broad-based.\"\n\nSAKSHI GUPTA, PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK, GURUGRAM\n\"GDP growth was in line with our expectations, growing at 7.8% in Q1. Within major sectors, services continued to drive overall growth, although there seem to be some signs now that contact-intensive services \u2014 that were a major support so far \u2014 are beginning to moderate.\"\n\n\"Manufacturing growth at 4.7% was broadly in line with the trend seen in high-frequency indicators and lower input costs continue to benefit corporate profitability. Going forward, risks to growth have increased, both from weather-related disturbances and as external headwinds \u2014 in terms of slower growth \u2014 remain high.\"\n\nDEVENDRA KUMAR PANT, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INDIA RATINGS &amp; RESEARCH, GURUGRAM\n\"1QFY24 GDP growth was on expected lines. Important trends \u2013 PFCE growth at 6% (a three-quarter-high) on a high base of 19.8% growth in 1QFY23, 8% GFCF growth on a high base of 20.4% in 1QFY23, and strong services growth. First-quarter agriculture gross value added (GVA) is dependent on the previous fiscal's agriculture performance. The pressure point is likely to emerge from agriculture and continued weakness in exports. However, the strong services growth momentum is likely to strongly support GDP growth in FY24.\"\n\nSACHCHIDANAND SHUKLA, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO, MUMBAI\n\"Q1 GDP numbers (are) broadly in line with expectations, with a confirmation of weakness on the consumption side and with El Nino impact yet to reflect on agri\/rural and discretionary consumption. But importantly, while from a year-on-year perspective this seems a peak for GDP numbers, from an absolute output perspective the numbers will actually be going up each subsequent quarter for the remainder of FY24.\"\n\nSUJAN HAJRA, CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ANAND RATHI SHARES AND STOCK BROKERS, MUMBAI\n\"India's GDP growth in Q1FY24 at 7.8% was a tad below our expectations of 8%. This once again makes India the fastest growing major economy, a position the country is likely to maintain for several years. Yet, we do not expect this pace to continue for the rest of the year and see the yearly growth at 6.2%. But that, too, is very good performance against the current global backdrop.\"\n\n\"We expect consumption to remain resilient and net exports to improve during the year but still remain a drag. We expect slowdown in investment. But this is likely to recover in FY25. With strong growth and elevated inflation, the RBI would be hard-pressed to tighten monetary policies. If retail inflation does remain high in August, we would expect a symbolic rate hike.\"\n\nGARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST, INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI\n\"Economic activity in Q1 FY24 at 7.8% was boosted by a continued uptick in urban centric services demand, and improved investment activity, led mainly by government. We see FY24 GDP growth at 6.2-6.3%.\n\nIn the near term, the following factors are likely to appear as key risks to India's growth:\n\n1) Uneven rainfall and weak August rains are likely to impact kharif yield and rabi sowing, thereby impacting rural demand and overall inflation\n\n2) Interest rates are likely to remain elevated for longer amid rebound in food prices and fear of generalisation of inflation expectations\n\n3) Slowing exports (both merchandise and services) as global demand moderates and the Indian rupee remains strong versus Asian peers putting pressure on competitiveness.\"\n\n","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"Small-batch customs seizures barely scratch the surface of how deeply cotton from Xinjiang is embedded in the global supply chain\n\nAt the onset of the decade, the widespread repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur community in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang prompted action. Much of the world decided to stop doing business with the region guilty of a plethora of human rights violations. In December 2021, US president Joe Biden even signed legislation barring goods made with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China from entering the US market.\n\nThe on-paper ban hasn\u2019t been so straightforward to implement on the ground, though. Finding partners that can provide equally abundant and similarly cheap cotton has been a task, and keeping the supply chain clean is onerous.\n\nIn Germany, researchers found traces of Xinjiang cotton in Adidas, Puma, and Hugo Boss in mid-2022. French prosecutors went after Zara, Uniqlo, and Sketchers. Basically, staying has its costs\u2014reputational damage, legal repercussions, and boycotts in China\u2014but leaving isn\u2019t easy either.\n\nNow, US authorities have more evidence that Xinjiang cotton is perhaps too deeply embedded in the global supply chain, and continues to make its way into the US. Roughly 27% of tests\u201410 out of 37\u2014performed on apparel and shoes collected by US Customs and Border Protection in May showed links to cotton from China\u2019s Xinjiang region, Reuters reported for the first time on Sept. 1, citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nThis testing in double-digits barely scratches the surface, considering the US imports millions of dollars worth of apparel and shoes each day. And Chinese cotton doesn\u2019t only come from China. Cotton and yarn produced in China is used extensively in other countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Bangladesh\u2014the world\u2019s largest producers of cotton clothing and consumer goods.\n\nQuotable: Hardly any apparel shipments are stopped and tested\n\u201cThe numbers are completely underwhelming. It\u2019s a few dozen shipments stopped. We\u2019re talking about thousands and millions of packages coming in that contain apparel items.\u201d\n\n\u2014Kim Glas, National Council of Textile Organizations, to Wall Street Journal in August 2023\n\nXinjiang cotton by Uyghur laborers, by the digits\n15%: Tests deemed to be consistent with Xinjiang, including seizures in May, April, and December of last year\n\n87%: Share of China\u2019s production that Xinjiang cotton accounts for\n\n23%: Xinjiang cotton in the global supply in 2020 and 2021\n\n100,000: Uyghurs and other ethnic minority ex-detainees that may be working in forced labor conditions in China, according to Department of Labor estimates \n\n53: Intermediary manufacturers\u2014from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Ethiopia, China, and Mexico\u2014that purchase unfinished cotton goods from five leading Chinese manufacturers (Huafu Fashion, Lianfa Textiles, Luthai Textiles, Texhong Textiles, and Weiqiao Textiles) that have sourced Xinjiang cotton, as per an October 2022 study by Britain\u2019s Sheffield Hallam University analyzing state and corporate records\n\n103: Well-known international brands that are supplied by those 53 intermediaries and are therefore at high risk of having Xinjiang cotton in their supply chains\n\nCompany of interest: Oritain\nCustoms officials and companies identify specific geographic origins of cotton using isotope analysis\u2014a sort of DNA test for cotton. Verification companies measure stable carbon, nitrogen, and other elements found in tested samples, and then compare those figures against a library of geographically distinct \u201cfingerprints\u201d to determine the origin of a particular sample.\n\nNew Zealand-headquartered Oritain is one of the prominent players in this industry.\n\nThe US Customs and Border Protection has made payments worth $1.3 million to Oritain since 2020 for cotton goods analysis, according to records from the agency obtained by Reuters under FOIA. (It\u2019s not clear if Oritain conducted the December 2022 or April and May 2023 tests.)\n\nCompanies also work with Oritain directly to keep their production practices traceable and transparent. For instance, lingerie brand Victoria\u2019s Secret, which requires that suppliers \u201cretain all documentation for the origin of raw material, processing and manufacturing,\u201d says Oritain testing may be conducted on the cotton used at any stage of the garment-making process\u2014on fiber, yarn, fabric, or finished goods.\n\nOf course, good intentions don\u2019t always translate to fair practices. Shein, the Chinese fast fashion into which the US launched a probe for sourcing cotton from the controversial Xinjiang region in May, contracts with Oritain, an isotopic testing company headquartered in New Zealand, to verify the origin of cotton in their supply chains. Ralph Lauren, which has been working with Oritain for years, is being investigated by Canada\u2019s corporate watchdog for allegedly benefiting from forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China as of this month.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

In total, more than $44 million in shipments were stolen during this period.\n\nThe average shipment value per event also increased nearly $100,000 to $260,703 per theft as cargo thieves focused on high-value shipments, CargoNet reported.\n\nShipping misdirection schemes on the rise\nSpeaking to Insurance Business, Lewis revealed that fraud schemes have become a global problem since the pandemic.\n\n\u201cDuring COVID, we learned we could work from anywhere in the world. So, what used to be a US- and Canada-based crime has become a global crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see a lot of folks committing high-level organized fraud in the United States as well as in other countries.\u201d\n\nShipping misdirection tactics use legitimate processes such as load boards to fraudulently acquire cargo. Attackers may pose as a motor carrier or logistics brokers to obtain their targeted shipment, then redirect it using a legitimate driver, Lewis explained.\n\n\u201cFreight moves almost like online dating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou match your type of equipment up with the type of load looking for a destination, and in one click the load is awarded to you if you meet the broker\u2019s criteria.\n\n\u201cThe frauds are committed when they pick up the load. It\u2019s not the distribution centers that are vulnerable; it\u2019s the way the loads are moving.\u201d\n\nCargoNet acknowledged significant growth in extortion and theft by conversion schemes, particularly among organized groups in Illinois and California.\n\nThese groups target shipments from logistics brokers, tacking on exorbitant fees for various manufactured reasons like overweight tickets or previous rate penalties charged to non-affiliated motor carriers. Criminal enforcement for these cases remains complex and rare, emboldening criminals.\n\nWhat do energy drinks, solar panels, and vehicle parts have in common?\nAccording to CargoNet, fictitious pickup groups stole shipments from 39 different product categories in the second quarter of 2023, but primarily focused their efforts on smaller groupings of freight.\n\nFood and beverage products, including alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic beverages such as soda and energy drinks, emerged as the top targets for thieves hijacking the supply chain.\n\nSolar power generation equipment and vehicle parts and supplies including fluids, oils, and tires are also popular stolen commodities.\n\nCargo and vehicle thefts \u2013 what\u2019s the link?\nThe car shortage during the pandemic has made vehicle parts more attractive targets for organized crime groups, according to Lewis, and has also contributed to the alarming rates of vehicle theft in Canada.\n\n\u201cSince COVID, there\u2019s been a shortage of cars, as well as parts, rebuilt engines, and even motor oil. That causes those products to be targeted more,\u201d he said.\n\nWorse, stolen freight often gets past customs checks at ports due to a lack of enforcement. The Equite Association, a Canadian not-for-profit organization against insurance crime, said that cargo losses in the country rose by nearly 30% in 2022 compared to the previous year.\n\n\u201cA police officer in Canada told me that they ship out about 15,000 containers a day from one port, but they just don\u2019t have enough people to inspect the containers,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere is a high number of vehicles being stolen in Canada right now, and it\u2019s because of the shortage of vehicles and vehicle parts.\u201d\n\nMitigating cargo theft risk\nLogistics brokers and shippers can help prevent fictitious cargo pickups by meticulously verifying shipping bids, particularly the name of the motor carrier and driver matches the shipment was tendered to.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems is the speed that we move freight. We move goods at a high velocity because when you slow down the flow of goods, you increase the cost and slow down the movement to the end-consumer,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cBetter vetting and slowing down the pace on the front end are important.\u201d\n\nCargoNet also advised motor carriers to be wary of new customers that want a blind shipment delivered to an unfamiliar address.\n\nFinally, Lewis advised freight companies to be vigilant about cargo theft threats and use industry intelligence to protect their shipments.\n\n\u201cThe bad actors are always going to get away with the first one or two loads,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then somebody is going to report it to us, and we\u2019re going to send out an alert or notice to the industry to be on the lookout for suspicious activity by that carrier. It\u2019s about using the data we provide to prevent thefts.\u201d\n\nShare your thoughts on cargo theft risks in the comments below.","labels":["supplychain"]}

The combined entity is operating as a holding company under the name \u201cDowDuPont\u2122\u201d with three divisions \u2013 Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products.\n\nShares of DuPont and Dow ceased trading at the close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Aug. 31, 2017. Beginning today, DowDuPont will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker symbol \u201cDWDP.\u201d Pursuant to the merger agreement, Dow shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 1.00 share of DowDuPont for each Dow share, and DuPont shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 1.282 shares of DowDuPont for each DuPont share.\n\n\u201cToday marks a significant milestone in the storied histories of our two companies,\u201d said Andrew Liveris, executive chairman of DowDuPont. \u201cWe are extremely excited to complete this transformational merger and move forward to create three intended industry-leading, independent, publicly traded companies. While our collective heritage and strength are impressive, the true value of this merger lies in the intended creation of three industry powerhouses that will define their markets and drive growth for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our teams have been working for more than a year on integration planning, and -- as of today -- we will hit the ground running on executing those plans with an intention to complete the separations as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor shareholders, customers and employees, closing this transaction is a definitive step toward unlocking higher value and greater opportunities through a future built on sustainable growth and innovation,\u201d said Ed Breen, chief executive officer of DowDuPont. \u201cDowDuPont is a launching pad for three intended strong companies that will be better positioned to reinvest in science and innovation, solve our customers\u2019 ever-evolving challenges, and generate long-term returns for our shareholders. With the merger now complete, our focus is on finalizing the organizational structures that will be the foundations of these three intended strong companies and capturing the synergies to unlock value. With clear focus, market visibility and more productive R&D, each intended company will be equipped to compete successfully as an industry leader.\u201d\n\nBoard and Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors of DowDuPont comprises 16 members \u2013 eight directors formerly on the DuPont Board and eight directors formerly on the Dow Board. There are two lead directors: Jeffrey Fettig, who previously served as the lead independent director for Dow; and Alexander Cutler, who previously served as the lead independent director for DuPont. Liveris serves as the executive chairman of the Board and Breen also serves on the Board. Other Board members include:\n\nFrom Dow:\n\nJames A. Bell, Former Chief Financial Officer, Boeing\nRaymond J. Milchovich, Former Chairman and CEO, Foster Wheeler AG\nPaul Polman, CEO, Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V.\nDennis H.

The transaction is expected to result in run-rate cost synergies of approximately $3 billion and the potential for approximately $1 billion in growth synergies. The company expects to reach 100 percent run rate on the cost synergies within the first 24 months of merger closing.\nCustomers will benefit from superior solutions and expanded product offerings.

{"text":"Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride over the last few years. All cryptocurrency is volatile with a track record of \u201cboom and bust\u201c cycles that have left many wondering whether it\u2019s safe to invest. We explain reasons for bitcoin\u2019s latest price action, along with the 2022 crypto market crash.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, dropped below $16,000 in November 2022, a year after it reached a record high of $69,000.\n\nThings started looking up in 2023, with bitcoin\u2019s price climbing above $30,000 in April. However, a rout in August wiped nearly all the gains made in the months prior. At one point the asset\u2019s price briefly fell to as low as around $25,200, down from July\u2019s high of $31,814.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind bitcoin\u2019s recent price action, and what might the future hold for the market?\n\nIn this article we explain:\n\n\nWhat is happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nWhy is the price of bitcoin going down?\nWhy did bitcoin crash in 2022?\nWhy is bitcoin so volatile?\nWill bitcoin crash or go back up?\nWhat\u2019s happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nBitcoin is incredibly volatile. It is prone to rising and falling sharply on a daily basis.\n\nIn the second half of August, the price of bitcoin fell from over $30,000 to its current level of around $26,000. This marks a decrease of around 13%, which could prove catastrophic to those holding the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency to be experiencing a tumultuous period. Generally, bitcoin\u2019s price action reflects wider market trends, with alternative cryptocurrencies known as \u2018altcoins\u2019 having a tendency to suffer in tandem with it.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is currently trading at a price of around $1,640 a coin, 10% less than a week prior.\n\nWhy has the price of bitcoin gone down?\nIt\u2019s impossible to assign a single clear cause behind bitcoin\u2019s latest dip in price, but here are some possible reasons:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk\u2019s spacecraft manufacturing company, SpaceX, may have sold part or all of its bitcoin holdings\nAnalysts expect the American central bank to keep hiking interest rates. This will make borrowing more expensive and potentially hamper spending on cryptocurrency, with investors instead favouring safer, traditional savings routes\nEvergrande, a Chinese property development giant, has recently filed for bankruptcy. There are fears that due to the size of the firm, the collapse will send ripples through the Chinese economy and hamper confidence, lowering cryptocurrency investment\nWhile inflation has fallen in several developed countries, there are still fears that it could remain historically high for some time. This can have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending on cryptocurrency\nThe cryptocurrency market has begun to face regulation in several major countries including China and United States \u2013 and therefore a stricter framework of rules. This has seen cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bittrex forced to shut down.\nBut while regulation could harm cryptocurrency prices in the short term, stricter policing of the market may give consumers greater confidence over the long run, which could see the market stabilise\nIt\u2019s not just the cryptocurrency market suffering. Global stocks have gone into a downturn as result of:\n\nThe war in Ukraine\nInflationary fears\nHigher interest rates, which have made it more expensive for businesses to borrow money\nTurbulence in the stock market has spilled over into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIs a bitcoin crash coming, or will bitcoin go back up?\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to investing, especially with cryptocurrency. As quickly as bitcoin falls, it could just as rapidly climb again.\n\nThere are a number of concerns about cryptocurrencies that are dampening its prospects:\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges going bust\nCrackdowns and heightened regulation in countries like China, the United States and the United Kingdom\nCalls for greater regulation across the globe\nEnvironmental concerns\nSecurity issues and hacks\nThe price being based solely on speculation\nFurther regulation is seen as a threat to the decentralisation of crypto, which is having an impact on the prices of digital currencies.\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is taking steps to crack down on the cryptocurrency market. This includes forcing investors to wait 24 hours after depositing money into cryptocurrency exchanges before they can access it. Find out more about the FCA\u2019s crackdown on crypto.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s actions is indicative of a wider trend of governments across the world taking the risks of cryptocurrency more seriously. If further steps are taken by regulators, we could see a fall in investment as the potential for profit in the market declines.\n\nHowever, in the long run, heightened regulation may prove fruitful for the market. This is because consumers may grow more confident with a stronger framework of rules, and a fall in volatility within the crypto market may cause them to be less fearful of losing large amounts of money.\n\nWhat are the positives of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nBitcoin\u2019s fans point to other positive qualities:\n\nTransformative technology that could revolutionise industries\nSimpler and cheaper transactions by cutting out \u201cmiddle men\u201d such as banks\nEasier global trade because, with a non-fiat digital currency, there would be no concerns about exchange rates\nTransactions are more confidential\nIt is a  safe store of value because it can\u2019t be printed or seized\nBitcoin has been touted as an alternative to gold, meaning it could prove itself as a hedge against inflation\nGiven its volatile nature, it is possible that bitcoin will gather momentum again at some point in the future (perhaps weeks, months or even years down the line, or perhaps not at all).\n\nCryptocurrency proponents will point out that given bitcoin\u2019s previous meteoric rises, it cannot be ruled out that the same could happen again.\n\nBut no one has a crystal ball and the speculative nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to predict.\n\nFind out more about the tips (and mistakes to avoid) when investing with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat caused bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2022?\nIn March 2022, the price of one bitcoin was around $46,000. But the market turbulence that followed saw this drop by nearly two thirds.\n\nIn June 2022 bitcoin dropped below $20,000 for the first time since 2020. This was prompted by the decision of Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, to freeze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions.\n\nThe move fuelled a slump across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, the most significant blow for crypto in 2022 was triggered by the collapse of FTX in November. This was a major cryptocurrency exchange which handled around $1 billion transactions each day. Its collapse had a knock-on effect on other crypto exchanges. In November 2022, the price of bitcoin fell to around $16,000, a far cry from its peak of around $65,000 a year prior.\n\nChina\u2019s continued crackdown on crypto also played a role. Transacting with or trading major cryptocurrencies is illegal there, as is \u2018mining\u2019 bitcoin \u2013 the process via which bitcoin is obtained. Find out more about how cryptocurrency works.\n\nIn addition to this, 2022 saw sudden and severe sell-offs of major cryptocurrencies. This triggered panic and further sell-offs which has knocked consumer confidence.\n\nDespite 2022 being a torrid year for bitcoin, it has since recovered some of the ground it lost last year and is now worth around $26,000.\n\nWhat were the negative stories behind bitcoin\u2019s collapse?\nNegative stories\nA number of negative stories and threats of further regulation contributed to bitcoin\u2019s collapse in 2022.\n\nThese included:\n\nNovember 2022 cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bust\nJune 2022, Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, froze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions\nJune 2022, Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, paused bitcoin withdrawals, blaming a \u201cstuck transaction\u201d that was causing a backlog\nEarly 2022, reports that Russia might ban cryptocurrency operations. After the invasion of Ukraine, there were calls for crypto exchanges to ban Russian transactions.\nMay 2021, Tesla boss Elon Musk said that the electric car maker would no longer be accepting digital payments over environmental concerns\nJune 2021, banks and payment institutions in China were told to stop enabling crypto transactions, and the Chinese government banned the mining of the currencies. Then in September 2021, all crypto transactions were declared illegal\nJune 2021, then US president Donald Trump described bitcoin as a \u201cscam\u201d competing against the dollar to be \u201cthe currency of the world\u201d\nFBI agents have seized millions of dollars in bitcoin from criminals over the years.\nAugust 2021, UK regulator the FCA in effect blacklisted Binance. Big banks such as HSBC and Santander blocked customers from making payments to Binance.\nAugust 2021, the International Monetary Fund warned the widespread use of crypto would threaten \u201cmacroeconomic stability\u201d and could harm financial integrity.\nWhat were the positive stories behind crypto\u2019s rise in 2021?\nThere have also been more positive stories and these have given the bitcoin price some protection over the past couple of years, as well as propelling bitcoin to its peak of around $65,000 in November 2021:\n\nMarch 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first big US bank to offer wealthier clients access to bitcoin funds \u2013 albeit restricted to no more than 2.5% of an investor\u2019s total net worth.\nJune 2021, a month after sparking a crypto sell-off, Elon Musk said Tesla would probably accept bitcoin payments again when more than 50% of its energy usage came from renewable sources.\nJuly 2021 Amazon posted a job advert for a \u201cdigital currency and blockchain product lead\u201d prompting speculation that it would soon accept bitcoin as payment.\nSept 2021 El Salvador become the first country to make bitcoin legal tender\nOther stories have been more mixed in terms of what they mean for cryptocurrencies. Among them has been the US Federal Reserve considering whether to launch its own \u201ccentral bank digital currency\u201d (CBDC).\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order that aims to co-ordinate the US government\u2019s actions on the regulation of digital assets.\n\nWhile many crypto fans think regulation is a bad thing, some think this new executive order could help with the development of digital assets, such as the CBDC, to ensure the right consumer protections are in place.\n\nRead our article here if you are still wondering whether or not to invest in bitcoin.\n","labels":["investments"]}

{"text":"Irresponsible spending. Misjudging summer 2022's crypto market implosion. Getting locked out of its own cryptocurrency wallet. These are some of the missteps detailed in a court filing submitted by battered crypto custodian Prime Trust as it seeks bankruptcy protection. \n\nIn a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Thursday, Prime Trust CEO Jor Law explained how the company was battered by a combination of the collapsing cryptocurrency market and a management team that failed to change course amid the plunge. Instead, Law\u2014who became interim CEO last November\u2014said the company\u2019s previous leaders doubled down on spending at a time when revenues were strained.\n\n\nAccording to Law, Prime Trust spent about $10.5 million in October against revenues of about $3.1 million, giving it a net-loss of over $7 million. A month later, the spending rose again to $11.1 million, costing it another net loss of about $8.4 million.\n\nAmong the events that hit the company directly last year was the collapse of TerraLUNA last May after the failure of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin and LUNA governance token. Law said that Prime Trust put $6 million in client funds and $2 million from its own treasury into Terra before it failed. \n\nIn another egregious incident, the company detailed how it locked itself out of its own cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nUnder the subheading \"The Wallet Event,\" Low detailed how company executives used a \"cold storage wallet\" for holding onto tokens, including ETH and ERC-20 compliant coins. One wallet, described as a \"98f Wallet,\" was set up in March 2018 as a device that required physical posession as well multiple signatures to access.\n\n\nNevada Forces Crypto Custodian Prime Trust to Shut Down\nRegulators in Nevada are moving to shut down troubled cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust after determining that the firm was so financially underwater that it would not be able to service customers anymore.  On Tuesday, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division submitted a filing to the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas that called for a freeze on all Prime Trust\u2019s business activities. The regulator also called for the appointment of a receiver to manage the business in place of its...\n\nHowever, according to the filing, new management subsequently decided to resume deposits of Prime Trust\u2019s customer assets into legacy wallets, at which point those assets became unrecoverable. The firm only learned of the mistake when an unidentified customer requested a large ETH withdrawal that the company could not fulfill.\n\nPrime Trust soon learned that it no longer had the physical devices\u2014engraved Cryptosteel plates\u2014needed even to access the old wallet. Crypto analysis firm Arkham claims to have identified the wallet on the blockchain, estimating it holds over $45 million in assets today.\n\n\nAlthough assets held with Fireblocks technology were always accessible, Law said Prime Trust still has no access to the 98f wallet. As a workaround, Law said \u201ccertain company employees\" began using fiat currencies from its client accounts to purchase ETH and meet withdrawal requests from December 2021 to March 2022, using over $76 million to fund them. \n\n\nBitGo Cancels Prime Trust Acquisition, Users Report Frozen Withdrawals\nCryptocurrency custodian BitGo is pulling out of acquisition talks with rival Prime Trust, putting the short-lived deal to an end.

{"text":"August 31, 2023 - In July 2023, two federal district court judges in the Southern District of New York issued rulings that touched on a crucial question for the digital asset space \u2014 whether secondary market digital asset sales through trading platforms constitute securities transactions subject to the federal securities laws.\n\nOn July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment decision in SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc., No. 20 Civ. 10832, ECF No. 874 (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2023), holding in part that Ripple's sales of XRP through trading platforms did not constitute securities transactions while its direct sales to institutional investors did. In contrast, on July 31, 2023, Judge Jed Rakoff rejected Judge Torres' distinction based on how the digital assets were sold in SEC v. Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd., No. 23 Civ. 01346, ECF No. 51 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2023), denying defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission's claims that they violated federal securities laws in part by selling various digital assets through trading platforms.\n\nAlthough Judge Torres and Judge Rakoff disagreed on whether sales through trading platforms may constitute securities transactions, the facts and procedural postures of the two cases differ in meaningful ways that may explain the outcomes and shed light on how future courts may view this legal issue.\n\nBackground\nRipple develops and manages a digital asset exchange network that operates on the XRP Ledger blockchain. When the XRP Ledger launched, a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP tokens were generated to facilitate international currency transactions. Ripple received 80 billion XRP, some of which it sold and transferred in three ways: (i) directly to counterparties \u2014 primarily institutional buyers \u2014 pursuant to written contracts (\"Institutional Sales\"); (ii) on trading platforms through the use of trading algorithms (\"Programmatic Sales\"); and (iii) to employees and third parties as a form of payment for services (\"Other Distributions\").\n\nTerraform develops and manages an ecosystem of digital assets and launched the Terra blockchain to record transactions in two of its digital assets, TerraUSD (\"UST\") and a companion cryptocurrency called \"LUNA.\" UST was developed as an algorithmic stablecoin, which in this case meant its price was algorithmically pegged to another asset, the U.S. dollar.\n\nFor a while, one UST could be traded for $1 of LUNA, and $1 of LUNA could be traded for one UST. Owners of UST could also deposit their tokens into a smart contract associated with the \"Anchor Protocol\" to earn returns Terraform allegedly advertised as 19-20%, to be derived through lending UST deposits to borrowers. Terraform allegedly sold UST, LUNA and three other digital assets \u2014 \"wLUNA,\" \"mAssets,\" and \"MIR\" \u2014 directly to institutional investors and through trading platforms to U.S. retail investors.\n\nThe SEC brought enforcement actions against Ripple and Terraform (and certain of their executives) in 2018 and 2023, respectively, alleging that the defendants' sales and distributions constituted unregistered sales of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nDecisions\nUnder the federal securities laws, investment contracts are a type of security and, therefore, their sale must comply with registration requirements. In Ripple and Terraform, the parties disputed whether the digital asset sales and distributions were investment contracts.\n\nBoth courts relied on the same body of law dealing with investment contracts stemming from and including SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946). To determine whether a transaction is an investment contract, courts assess whether a person (i) invests his money (ii) in a common enterprise and (iii) has a reasonable expectation of profit based on the entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of the promoter. Howey, 328 U.S. at 299.\n\nSEC v. Ripple\nIn an order deciding competing summary judgment motions, Judge Torres analyzed the three categories of transactions in which Ripple engaged and found that only the Institutional Sales were offered and sold as investment contracts.\n\nIn assessing the third prong of the Howey test for the Institutional Sales, the court found that the institutional investors had a reasonable expectation of profits derived from Ripple's efforts, noting that, \"[f]rom Ripple's communications, marketing campaign, and the nature of the Institutional Sales, reasonable investors would understand that Ripple would use the capital received from its Institutional Sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP Ledger, thereby increasing the value of XRP.\" Ripple Labs, ECF No. 874 at 19.\n\nImportantly, the court determined the Programmatic Sales \u2014 Ripple's sales on digital asset trading platforms \u2014 did not constitute investment contracts because the \"expectation of profits\" prong of Howey was not met. The court noted these sales occurred on secondary trading platforms that match buyers and sellers without disclosing the identity of either.\n\nBecause the buyers in Programmatic Sales did not know they were buying XRP from Ripple, the court found they did not reasonably expect that Ripple would use their funds to increase the value of XRP. Contrasting these buyers to the purchasers in Institutional Sales, the court also concluded that, due to their lack of sophistication, there was no evidence the buyers in Programmatic Sales had their expectations informed by Ripple's public statements and, therefore, the court did not consider Ripple's statements in its analysis.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 2023, the SEC filed a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal of the court's ruling on Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions.\n\nSEC v. Terraform\nIn deciding the motion to dismiss in Terraform, Judge Rakoff was required to accept as true the allegations in the SEC's complaint. At that juncture, the court held that the SEC adequately pled that Terraform's sales of its various digital assets were investment contracts.\n\nWhen considering the SEC's allegations regarding secondary market sales to retail investors, the Terraform court stated that it \"reject[ed] the approach recently adopted\" by Judge Torres in Ripple and declined to distinguish between the assets sold directly to institutional investors and the assets sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors. Terraform Labs, ECF No. 51 at 40.\n\nThe court explained, \"[t]hat a purchaser bought the tokens directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary re-sale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants' actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.\"\n\nIn contrast to Ripple, the Terraform court considered defendants' public statements, accepted as true, including that Terraform and its founder promised all purchasers \"rates of returns of 19-20%\" and that \"sales from purchases of all crypto-assets \u2014 no matter where the tokens were purchased \u2014 would be fed back into the Terraform blockchain and would generate additional profits for all crypto-asset holders.\" The court concluded that these alleged statements gave secondary-market purchasers good reason to believe that Terraform would use their capital contributions to generate profits on their behalf.\n\nAnalysis and implications\nThe question of whether digital asset sales on trading platforms constitute securities transactions is of central importance to the SEC's broader enforcement initiatives, as the SEC recognized in its Aug. 18, 2023, motion seeking an interlocutory appeal in Ripple. While we await further potential guidance from the 2d U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a closer look at the facts in Ripple and Terraform may provide insights into why the district courts reached seemingly different conclusions.\n\nAlthough Judge Rakoff stated that he rejected Judge Torres's ruling on Programmatic Sales, that rejection does not appear to have been a total one. Both decisions sought to answer the same two questions. First, can an unsophisticated purchaser have an expectation of profit informed by the promoter's marketing campaign and public statements? And, second, could secondary-market purchasers who buy from unknown sellers reasonably expect profits based on the promoters' use of the money paid by the buyer?\n\nAs to the first question, Judge Rakoff, in deciding a motion to dismiss, answered \"yes.\" Judge Torres, in deciding competing motions for summary judgment, ruled that the record demonstrated that Ripple's statements were made across various platforms and were sometimes inconsistent, and thus there was no evidence that an unsophisticated purchaser would have had a reasonable expectation of profit based on this varied collection of statements.\n\nOn the second question, both judges appear to have aligned on the answer. Given this consistency, the differing results of the two decisions appear to be more driven by important factual distinctions and procedural posture than differing legal analysis.\n\nIn answering the second question, Judge Torres ruled that the evidentiary record failed to show that secondary-market purchasers had a reason to believe their sales proceeds would be used by the promoters to generate profits for purchasers because sales on secondary markets are not typically made by the issuer or promoter but rather by unknown third parties. Unlike in Ripple, the SEC in Terraform alleged that the defendants told all purchasers that funds from all digital asset sales \u2014 including those on secondary markets \u2014 would be fed back into the Terraform ecosystem to generate profits for purchasers.\n\nGiven this allegation (assumed as true at the pleading stage), Judge Rakoff ruled that \"secondary-market purchasers had every bit as good a reason to believe that the defendants would take their capital contributions and use it to generate profits on their behalf.\" Terraform Labs, ECF No. 51 at 42.\n\nIn Ripple, however, even if Judge Torres agreed with Judge Rakoff on the answer to the first question, there was no evidence of a comparable statement being made by the defendants. And, conversely, given Judge Rakoff's heavy reliance on this uncommon allegation, it is not clear he would have reached the same result if that allegation was not made.\n\nAlthough it was not directly addressed by either decision, it is possible that these factual distinctions would also impact how a court might analyze the \"common enterprise\" prong of Howey when evaluating secondary market sales not made by the issuer. In those circumstances, purchasers' funds would not be pooled and used by the promoters to generate profits, but would go to myriad unknown third parties who would not use the funds to generate profits for the purchasers.\n\nNotably, Ripple and Terraform are both SEC enforcement actions against digital asset issuers rather than secondary trading platforms. Because those who act as a broker-dealer or an exchange for securities may be required to register with the SEC, the treatment of secondary market sales under the Howey test will likely have profound implications for many digital asset trading platforms. Because many (if not most) digital asset issuers do not claim, as was alleged in Terraform, that secondary market sales proceeds will be used to generate profits, it is possible that the Terraform decision may be limited in future decisions to its unique alleged facts.","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"New Mexico and the U.S. government have reached a $32 million settlement over a 2015 mine spill that polluted rivers in three western states.\n\nSimilar environmental accidents will be intolerable in the future as the region grapples with shrinking water supplies amid drought and climate change, the governor said Thursday.\n\n\u201cEvery drop is precious,\u201d Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said during a news conference. \u201cIf we don't have that water, we aren't growing our own food.\u201d\n\nThe spill released 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of wastewater from the inactive Gold King Mine in southwestern Colorado, sending a bright-yellow plume of arsenic, lead and other heavy metals south to New Mexico, through the Navajo Nation and into Utah through the San Juan and Animas rivers.\n\nWater utilities were forced to scramble and shut down intake valves while farmers stopped drawing from the rivers as the contaminants moved downstream.\n\nThe New Mexico settlement marks just the latest reached over the past year. Colorado and the Navajo Nation also have inked multimillion-dollar agreements to settle claims and sort out responsibility for continued cleanup at the Superfund site that was established following the spill.\n\nUnder the New Mexico agreement, the federal government will make cash payments for response costs, environmental restoration and efforts to mitigate the negative perceptions about the area's rivers following the spill. Money also will go toward water quality monitoring and cleanup activities.\n\nLujan Grisham called the settlement a turning point for communities in the region.\n\n\"While the San Juan and Animas rivers have healed from the spill, it\u2019s time for communities like Farmington, Bloomfield, and Aztec to do the same,\u201d she said in a statement, saying the money is deserved in light of the federal government's role in the disaster.\n\nThe state also received $11 million in damages from the mining companies, and the case against the federal contractors involved is pending.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2015, Environmental Protection Agency contractors attempting cleanup work caused the release of the toxic wastewater. The plume eventually reached Lake Powell in Utah.\n\nAlthough the rivers are now safe for irrigation and other uses, state and local officials have said the stigma associated with the event has had lasting effects on the region\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Navajo Nation finalized a $31 million settlement with the federal government this week. The tribe said the plume had traveled through an estimated 200 miles (322 kilometers) of the San Juan River, which it considers sacred.\n\nTop Navajo officials traveled to the mine site and shared photos and video of the wastewater rushing downstream on social media.\n\nNavajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said the tribe had pledged to hold accountable all those who caused or contributed to the spill. He added that he was grateful the federal government acknowledged the devastation that it caused.\n\nWhile New Mexico and the Navajo Nation pursued separate lawsuits, the cases were consolidated and state officials said Thursday that remediation and restoration work will be coordinated.\n\nState officials said a restoration plan will be developed with public input.","labels":["None"]}

Applying them to your cybersecurity program could help your organization avoid a similar fate.\n\n1. Commit to a Rigorous Security Patch Program\nICRC's vulnerability management processes failed to detect and address the exploit that led to this data breach - an oversight likely resulting from the difficulty of managing ICRC's complex, large-scale patching processes, which address tens of thousands of patches across multiple systems annually.\n\nUnfortunately, cybercriminals are not sympathetic to complex cybersecurity problems. They will take advantage of whatever exploit they discover - especially when their attacks are well-planned and targeted, which seems to be the case in this instance.\n\nRe-evaluate your current vulnerability patching routine to ensure it can rapidly address new critical vulnerabilities published on the  National Vulnerability Database (NVD).\n\n2. Follow a Regular Penetration Testing Schedule\nDespite having a multi-level cyber defense system in place comprising of endpoint monitoring and scanning software, ICRC was still breached. While it's fair to attribute the success of the attack to unusually sophisticated hacking techniques rather than the insufficiency of ICRC's cybersecurity program, this event highlights the importance of having backup processes for detecting security exploits should internal efforts fail.\n\nEstablish a regular penetration testing schedule for detecting network, system, and application vulnerabilities across your entire IT ecosystem. Pen testing methods should be commensurate to the complexity of cyberattacks likely to target your organization. High data breach risks industries, such as finance, healthcare, and technology, should assume they will be targeted by highly-complex cyber attackers.\n\nIf you prefer to manage pen testing internally rather than outsourcing to a third-party, here are some offensive security tools you should be aware of: \n\nMetasploit: An open-source framework for developing, testing, and executing exploits\nNessus: A vulnerability scanner that can identify and assess vulnerabilities in networks and systems\nMaltego: A tool for open-source intelligence and forensic analysis\nAircrack-ng: A suite of tools for wireless network cracking\nCain and Abel: A password cracking tool\nJohn the Ripper: A fast password-cracking tool\nSocial Engineer Toolkit (SET): A tool for performing social engineering attacks\nis your business at risk of a data breach?\n3.

{"text":"The input costs to farm have been continually rising for many years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) February 2023 Farm Sector Income forecast projected total farm production expenses in 2023 at nearly $500 billion, up 4% from the prior year, but up $87 billion, or more than 28%, from 2020. For those raising livestock, looking outside of the typical commodity markets and focusing on direct-to-consumer meat sales may be an opportunity to increase revenue.\n\nGarth Ruff, Ohio State Extension Beef Cattle Field Specialist, noticed the trend of direct-to-consumer sales increase in the wake of COVID in 2020. Many people turned to their local livestock producers for protein, instead of going to the grocery store.\n\n\u201cDuring COVID, we had quite a few calls and a high amount of people interested in selling directly to consumers. It\u2019s leveled out since then. That\u2019s been our big question the last few years, how many of these direct-to-consumer sales will be maintained?\u201d Ruff said. \u201cAs long as the customer has a positive eating experience, they will continue to buy and spend money with that livestock producer.\u201d\n\nTo sell and price meat profitably, Ruff states that first, you must know your cost of production. Keeping accurate and consistent records of expenses is key.\n\n\u201cIf a producer doesn\u2019t know what their production costs are, then we start looking at USDA reports, which gives us a baseline for prices,\u201d Ruff said.\n\nFrom there, a livestock producer needs to consider what margin they want to make, as well as the market demand. Researching the customer base and their values can help to price meat profitably. For example, a livestock producer with aspirations to sell their products at an urban city farmer\u2019s market, where there\u2019s more disposable income, is probably able to charge higher prices than a producer selling to a less affluent, more rural area.\n\nBesides the cost of production of the animal itself, Ruff shared that many producers tend to forget the cost of customer acquisition.\n\n\u201cA big thing I\u2019ve seen is that there is a cost to acquire customers, whether that\u2019s marketing, fuel, or just your time. A lot of producers don\u2019t necessarily value their time appropriately. I don\u2019t think most people would take a job for $8 an hour, so that\u2019s not the labor cost you should set for marketing your meat,\u201d Ruff said.\n\nWhen it comes to customer acquisition, many livestock producers turn to word of mouth or social media to help sell their products. Andy Stockmaster is a livestock producer in New Washington in Crawford County. Every year he sells roughly a dozen head of freezer beef and around 25 to 30 hogs to people using Facebook as his marketing platform.  \n\n\u201cWe try to sell all our livestock directly to customers. Taking livestock to the sale barn is our last resort,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I do find it hard to set prices, I think I do have better control of my prices by selling directly. I like that my product then ends up with local families and in the community.\u201d\n\nStockmaster tends to sell all his livestock as whole carcasses, halves or quarters. He tried cuts but found he didn\u2019t have enough interest to continue down that route.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult part of pricing is that I want to give my customers an affordable price, but I have a profit figure in my head that I have to reach too,\u201d Stockmaster said.\n\nStockmaster follows Ruff\u2019s model, by taking his cost of production and then setting a margin he would like to achieve.\n\n\u201cI try to also compare to the market prices at that time too for both the live animal and retail cuts, and try to set prices in that ballpark,\u201d Stockmaster said.\n\nWhile beef and pork are proteins that many consumers are familiar with, Rose Hartschuh is looking to drive demand for lamb. Hartschuh and her family, also in Crawford County, currently have a small freezer lamb business, with around five to 10 lambs a year being sold directly to customers.\n\n\nFreezer lamb is an area of potential growth as customers are familiarized with the various cuts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different than selling freezer beef and pork. With beef and pork, you can get a customer to commit to a half or a quarter. With lamb, people are more hesitant, so we sell lamb by the cut,\u201d Hartschuh said. \u201cWe have to be above what the sale barn charges every week. We try to work backward a little bit. We also have to keep into account the dressing percentage of the lamb too. They are lower yielding animals than a steer or a hog.\u201d \n\nHartschuh goes to a processor that is about an hour away from her farm in Lykens. The processor is more familiar with lambs and goats and offers a wider variety of cut options. One way they market lamb is by offering cuts that anyone can cook.\n\n\u201cWe like to get burgers and bratwursts made because they are easy to grill. We also do a lot of boneless leg of lamb, because those are easy to cook in the oven, crockpot or smoker. We also sell beef and pork, so we\u2019ve created bundle deals or we throw in some lamb for people to try,\u201d Hartschuh said. \u201cOur goal is to continue to grow our freezer lamb business because we can set our price, it\u2019s consistent revenue and additional cash flow through the year. It\u2019s got big potential to grow.\u201d \n\nFor those producers who are looking for help in establishing pricing for cuts, Penn State Extension recently published a model for pricing to remain profitable. First, start with the per pound cost of the live animal. This would include all costs of production. Next, divide this amount by the dressing percentage. The average dressing percentage is 60% for cattle, 70% for hogs and 50% for sheep and goats. This is now the hanging cost. Next, add any processing or trucking fees to the hanging cost. Divide the total by 65% to get a cut-out cost, and then divide that cut-out cost by the percentage markup the producer desires to reach. This will lead to a price that should be charged per pound.\n\nRuff and a team of other Ohio State Extension personnel are working to address the big push for local foods and direct-to-consumer meats. They are in the process of putting together a self-paced course on how to start and maintain a food business.\n\n\u201cThis past winter we had good attendance in the webinar series we did on starting a local food business. Our team can offer resources on food safety, labeling and understanding all the legalities of selling meat directly to people,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some mislabeling the last couple of years, so those are things we talk about in our programs quite a bit. You can\u2019t use USDA quality grades to sell your product unless it\u2019s truly been graded. Those are things you need to know upfront if you are going to sell directly to consumers.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that all meat sold direct-to-consumer needs to be USDA or Ohio Department of Agriculture inspected for food safety. Producers looking to sell at farmer\u2019s markets or local businesses need to work with their county health departments in order to do that.

A decline in investor confidence in the banking sector, for example, could still spell trouble for shares of the Cupertino company.\n\nThis seems to be exactly what happened in the last two trading days of last week, when AAPL dropped from an intraday peak of nearly $155 apiece.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Apple Stock?\nIn the short term, AAPL is likely to remain under pressure until the market gets a firmer grasp on the risks to the broader economy and market.\n\nHowever, in the longer term, Apple may outperform the S&P 500 (SPY), especially in the case of an extended bearish reaction. The Cupertino company is generally considered a stabler blue chip company that can better weather storms like this one.\n\nThe fallout from the SVB crisis on Apple stock is likely to be twofold.\n\nFirst, the stock could experience short-term pressure as the market reacts to the news of the Silicon Valley Bank shutdown.\nSecond, in the longer term, Apple may outperform the S&P 500 due to the fortress characteristics mentioned above, especially in the case of an extended bearish reaction.\nKey Takeaway\nIn conclusion, the recent drop in Apple stock on Friday, March 10, can be attributed to the crisis that impacted SVB Financial and its subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nAlthough there is no evidence that Apple has been directly impacted by this issue, the company's position as the largest stock in the S&P 500 means that its performance is likely to follow that of the broader market index.\n\nWhile AAPL is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the uncertainty in the market, the company's strong balance sheet and stable position in the tech sector may help it to outperform the S&P 500 in the longer term.\n\nAsk Twitter\nSilicon Valley Bank was shut down on Friday, March 10. What do you think this means for Apple stock?\n\n\n(Disclaimers: this is not investment advice. The author may be long one or more stocks mentioned in this report.

{"text":"The current Ebola outbreak is becoming more than just a worldwide emergency health issue. It is becoming a supply chain concern. While our thoughts are with those impacted by the awful disease, the potential supply chain risk is also creeping into the minds of business leaders.\n\nResilinc\u2019s monitoring shows some signs of a ripple effect on supply chain sourcing, pricing and availability of key raw materials. These events, indicated by an increasing number of news reports, raise flags about the impact the disease has on mining activities (particularly with alumina, iron ore and gold), palm oil and palm kernel oil supplies, and potential crude oil disruptions.\n\n\nProtecting Your Supply Chain\nTo avoid possible supply chain disruptions, companies can take a few steps now to secure their supply chains and mitigate risks associated with the contagion.\n\nHere are Resilinc\u2019s recommendations:\n\nImprove communication with partners. Actively engage suppliers in information-sharing notifications and, when possible, stay flexible when making sourcing, procurement and logistics decisions.\nMap and identify tier-one and sub-tier suppliers operating in and nearby countries affected by Ebola. Resilinc subscribers can use the \u201cWhat if\u201d tab in your dashboard for instant supply chain analytics. However, if you do not subscribe to Resilinc\u2019s service, here\u2019s some guidance:\nLocate where your raw materials are sourced and how these materials move across multiple tiers of suppliers globally\nAnalyze where and how key suppliers are likely to be impacted\nDetermine which products are at risk for a disruption and calculate the potential negative effect on your revenue and profits\nAnalyze current inventory levels for critical components, commodities and raw minerals. Understand which raw materials could most likely affect your production and delivery targets. Resilinc\u2019s supply chain analysis, for example, shows that one of the largest exports from Liberia, a country hard hit by the Ebola outbreak, is palm oil and palm kernel oil, a key building block in many raw materials. Luckily, 80 to 90 percent of these global supplies come from Malaysia and Indonesia, therefore the impact should be minimal. While global pricing is stable at this point, Resilinc is closely monitoring the situation. Below are materials that are downstream of palm oil and palm kernel oil.\nAscorbyl palmitate (antioxidant)\nCalcium stearate (tablet mold release agent and lubricant)\nCaprylic acid (treatment for some fungal and bacterial infections; surfactant, and cleaning agent)\nCetyl palmitate (emollient ingredient)\nIsopropyl myristate (solvent for topical therapeutics)\nSodium dodecyl sulfate (also known as SDS; surfactant)\nMagnesium stearate (tablet mold release agent and lubricant)\nMyristic acid (solvent for therapeutics)\nPalmitic acid (palmitoylation of proteins)\nPolysorbate 20 (surfactant and emulsifier)\nPolysorbate 80 (surfactant and emulsifier)\nSodium caprylate (treatment for some fungal infections; surfactant, and cleaning agent)\nSodium stearate (tablet mold release agent and lubricant)\nVitamin A palmitate (antioxidant)\nVitamin C ester (antioxidant)\nIn the midst of a crisis, knowledge brings peace of mind. Some manufacturers will spend hours and weeks monitoring and analyzing the potential impact Ebola could have on their supply chain. With Resilinc\u2019s pro-active supply chain mapping and monitoring, attaining that peace is just a click away.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}
{"text":"Aug 30 (Reuters) - French telecom provider Iliad reported a more than 4% rise in half-year core profit on Wednesday, supported by gains across markets and the expansion of its activities in Italy.\n\nThe unlisted company, which operates in France, Italy and Poland, posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and after leases (EBITDAal) of 1.64 billion euros ($1.78 billion) for the first half of 2023, up from 1.58 billion a year earlier.\nIliad's performance makes it an outlier among industry peers, after French rivals Orange (ORAN.PA) and SFR, part of the Altice group (ATUS.N), recorded weaker earnings growth for the half-year period.\n\nIn an economic context \"full of uncertainties, caution is called for, but Iliad's development model is proving its robustness\", Chief Executive Thomas Raynaud said in a statement.\n\nTelecommunications companies across Europe have been hit by rising energy prices, infrastructure costs to deploy fibre and 5G coverage, and a slowdown in subscriber growth. This has led all Iliad's competitors on the French market to increase their rates.\n\nFree Mobile, Iliad's French service provider and largest branch in terms of revenue, earlier this year set a five-year price cap on its plans, an anti-inflation measure that was criticised as the price of add-ons was nonetheless increased.\n\nAsked about the cost of this measure during a press call, Raynaud described the price cap as an \"opportunity to lead the race in terms of market share gains\". He did not comment on the cost.\n\nRegarding Italy's recent decision to join U.S. fund KKR's bid for Telecom Italia's (TLIT.MI) grid, Raynaud said the move underlined a \"strong political will\" to deploy fibre across the country, to which Iliad contributes, adding the group was waiting for more details.\n\nThe group remains on the lookout for potential acquisitions in Italy after its 2022 Vodafone bid was rejected, he said.\n\n","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"The pandemic was an economic boon for the nation\u2019s tech centers last year, but the tide already has turned as consumers\u2019 demand for remote work software, delivered food, and streaming entertainment subsides.\n\nTech-driven counties in California\u2019s Silicon Valley and around Seattle, Washington, and Austin, Texas, boomed as the COVID-19 pandemic raged, according to a Stateline analysis of new data on economic output released this month by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThe analysis of 2019 to 2021 changes in county-by-county gross domestic product, known as GDP, shows how local economies fared in the early months of the pandemic, an indicator of how Americans responded at a time when many were staying home and supply chain problems interrupted some consumer buying.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic came along, we all thought it was going to be a crippling blow to our economy, but we were wrong. It was a bonanza,\u201d said Russell Hancock, CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a private-public economic development group based in Santa Clara County.\n\nRemote work fed demand for Apple devices and online-based services such as Zoom, DoorDash, and Netflix, all based in Silicon Valley, he said. The latest year has not gone as well for tech firms in the pandemic boom towns.\n\n\u201cIt was a spike, and it came back down. We\u2019re adjusting,\u201d Hancock said.\n\nSanta Clara County saw the biggest bump in real GDP for a large county between 2019 and 2021, up 19%. Austin\u2019s Travis County grew 14%, and Seattle\u2019s King County grew 13%. Real GDP measures economic output as the total value of goods and services produced in the county, adjusted for inflation.\n\nOther counties with populations of at least a million people and with fast-growing economies from 2019 to 2021 were mostly in the Sun Belt, where jobs and population boomed: Collin County, Texas (up 12%); Palm Beach County, Florida, and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (both up 9%); and the trio of Salt Lake County, Utah, Hillsborough County, Florida, and Maricopa County, Arizona (all up 8%).\n\nIn Washington state, King County software design at companies such as Microsoft and online sales from Amazon helped the county boom despise job losses in tourism and manufacturing, said David Reich, chief economist for the county\u2019s Office of Economic and Financial Analysis.\n\n\u201cThe [tech] sector was really important in providing the tools we needed during the pandemic, even if most of those workers were working remotely,\u201d Reich said, adding that tech provided 85% of the county\u2019s boost in GDP.\n\nIn Texas, the Austin area hosts tech companies such as Dell and Oracle.\n\nMany of the hot tech economies have cooled this year. King County\u2019s latest economic indicators, compiled by Reich, show last year\u2019s spike dropping back to 2019 levels this year. Tech employment has fallen as big tech firms such as Microsoft and Amazon and online real-estate firms like Redfin and Zillow have announced layoffs, Reich said.\n\nBut overall, jobs are up in the Seattle area as tourism returns, drawing more cruise ships and hotel stays. That bodes well for continued, if slower, improvement this year and in 2023, according to King County\u2019s latest projections.\n\nThe same patterns hold true in other areas, said Adam Kamins, senior director at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n\u201cRunaway growth in tech-dependent counties has likely cooled considerably in 2022,\u201d Kamins said. Tech companies in Silicon Valley and Seattle are considering more layoffs, and more offices in Austin are becoming vacant due to layoffs and hiring freezes.\n\nThe biggest GDP loss from 2019 to 2021, 6%, also was in California, in Contra Costa County, east of Oakland, where more conventional manufacturing did not fare well in the pandemic.\n\nMarathon Oil shuttered a refinery in Contra Costa County, laying off more than 700 workers, and manufacturer Posco in Pittsburg, a Contra Costa County city, laid off 216 workers in 2020.\n\n\u201cThroughout the pandemic, working people lost so much while a select few saw record profits,\u201d said Joshua Anijar, director of the Contra Costa Central Labor Council, a union group. Tech workers have started moving in as housing prices spiral in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the area\u2019s manufacturing legacy is disappearing. Today, the Posco plant is preparing to shut down, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to continue to be an industrial county or just another suburb of Oakland and San Francisco,\u201d Anijar said. \u201cWe\u2019re only now starting to see the full effects of the pandemic. At first, we saw the tourism areas suffering, but that\u2019s not us.\u201d\n\nTourism centers in Hawaii and Nevada also saw losses as travelers stayed close to home.\n\nHonolulu lost 5% of GDP from 2019 to 2021 as tourism and convention business had not bounced back. This year, visitor arrivals and spending are up in Hawaii, according to a November state report, and are close to recovering to 2019 levels.\n\nOther counties losing GDP were Queens, New York, (down 4%) and the Bronx (down 2%) where services and hospitality such as restaurants had not recovered. Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located, lost 1% between 2019 and 2021 with energy the main culprit, before oil prices spiked this year.\n\nClark County, Nevada, home of Las Vegas, and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, also had 1% drops.\n\nTourism rebounds and higher oil prices likely have helped places with shrinking economies, Kamins said.\n\n\u201cThe New York City boroughs have stabilized and probably made up some ground this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more pronounced rebounds are likely in Houston due to the impact of high oil prices, and around Honolulu, as tourism and business travel have largely returned.\u201d\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","financial_success"]}

{"text":"The husband of a congresswoman from Alaska died in a plane crash this week \u2014 one of numerous aviation crashes that have given the state the highest rate of plane crashes in the nation.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nEugene \"Buzzy\" Peltola Jr., who was married to Alaska Congresswoman Mary Peltola, died this week after a small airplane he was piloting crashed in the western part of the state. Alaskan members of Congress and family members have been involved in plane accidents before. The state lags behind the rest of the country when it comes to aviation safety. Alaska Public Media's Liz Ruskin has more.\n\nLIZ RUSKIN, BYLINE: Eugene Peltola Jr. was alone in a Piper Super Cub that crashed on departure from a moose hunting camp near the Yukon River. He died before a rescue aircraft arrived.\n\nJENNIFER HOMENDY: It's a very remote, mountainous location. That's all the information I can provide at this time.\n\nRUSKIN: National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy gave a preliminary briefing on Wednesday. She said the cause of the crash is still unknown, and NTSB is investigating it. For Alaskans, a crash like this triggers grim memories.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens was killed in a plane crash in the state he long represented.\n\nRUSKIN: That was in 2010. Stevens' wife, Ann, died in a 1978 plane crash. And in 1972, a plane carrying Alaska's then-Congressman Nick Begich and House Majority Leader Hale Boggs disappeared and is presumed to have crashed. It's not just politicians. Alaskans have to fly a lot. Many don't live on the state's minuscule road system. According to the Air Safety Institute, Alaska's fatality rate per hours flown in small private aircraft used to be twice as high as elsewhere. Despite a dramatic improvement since 2016, it's still higher than the national average. Same for small commercial aircraft.\n\nCOLLEEN MONDOR: We die a little bit at a time - one here, two there, three there.\n\nRUSKIN: That's Colleen Mondor, a Fairbanks pilot and aviation writer with encyclopedic knowledge of Alaska's plane accidents. She thinks it's too easy for people to dismiss Alaska plane crashes because each one has only a few fatalities.\n\nMONDOR: Every now and again, there's a big one, a midair that breaks through to international news. But mostly we die like this, one or two or three at a time. It just gets lost.\n\nRUSKIN: She's sick of seeing the cause shrugged off as Alaska's bad weather.\n\nMONDOR: It's not the weather, OK? It's not that, oh, my God, that weather was so bad. It's what was the information provided on the weather?\n\nRUSKIN: The real problem, she and other aviation experts say, is that Alaska hasn't had enough safety infrastructure like paved runways, statewide communications coverage and - one of the most critical - weather reporting equipment. In Alaska, the FAA and the National Weather Service manage about 140 automated weather stations that provide crucial information to pilots. Tom George, Alaska manager for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, says that's not nearly enough.\n\nTOM GEORGE: We'd have to get about 180 more stations in Alaska to have the same average density that the rest of the country enjoys.\n\nRUSKIN: In an emailed statement, the FAA said that in recent years they've added new weather stations and that improving aviation safety in Alaska is one of their top priorities.

{"text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 More than a year and a half after the COVID-19 pandemic began to rock supply chains around the world, the defense industry is still wrestling with its fallout \u2014 and figuring out how to move forward amid the turmoil.\n\nFrom massive deliveries of steel and aluminum needed to build the U.S. military\u2019s newest ships and aircraft to landing gear brakes to items as small as semiconductors, supply chain shortages or delays have upended the plans of defense firms of all sizes.\n\n\nMuch of the nation\u2019s broader attention on supply chains has focused on the rising costs of feeding a family or worried parents scrambling to order presents well before Christmas to ensure Santa will have something to leave under the tree.\n\nBut those in the defense industry are increasingly making clear the challenges they\u2019re facing \u2014 and Pentagon officials are taking notice as they consider what this means for their own logistics.\n\nSupply chain issues sparked by the pandemic were a recurring theme during recent contractor earnings calls. One major defense firm after another pointed to the problems they faced, in some cases as an explanation for lower-than-expected sales.\n\n\nThese issues dealt a significant blow to the aerospace and defense industry, according to the Aerospace Industries Association. In 2020, the industry as a whole lost more than 87,000 jobs, or about 4% of the 2019 headcount, according to an AIA report released in September.\n\nAnd 64% of those losses \u2014 or at least 55,700 jobs \u2014 were due to the supply chain problems that particularly ensnared small and medium-sized businesses nationwide, John Luddy, AIA\u2019s vice president for national security policy, said in a statement to Defense News.\n\nSupply chains problems can stem from a variety of issues, such as a lack of raw materials to make vital parts; bottlenecks when trying to transport finished items, like a shortage of shipping containers; backlogged ports without enough people to unload shipments; or a dearth of trucks available to drive items across the country. Financing challenges also dealt another blow to those small firms, AIA said.\n\n\u201cBecause end-use manufacturers rely on the vital components and products those [small and medium-sized aerospace and defense] companies produce, such as bolts, wiring, hoses and electronics, those losses in employees, revenue and products had serious ripple effects throughout the rest of the A&D industry,\u201d Luddy said.\n\n\nSome firms have seen pandemic-driven workforce problems contribute to supply chain issues. Before the COVID-19 vaccines, this was typically driven by the need to maintain social distancing and a workforce concerned about contracting the dangerous virus. Now, controversies involving vaccine mandates are throwing a new curveball into companies\u2019 efforts to remain fully staffed.\n\nSmall companies with slimmer profit margins have found weathering supply chain upheavals particularly challenging, said ML Mackey, chair of the small business division for the National Defense Industrial Association and chief executive of the defense IT contractor Beacon Interactive Systems.\n\n\u201cWhen something hits us, the waves are much harder,\u201d Mackey said in a Nov. 19 interview. \u201cA big ship can handle the waves. But a canoe? It\u2019s bobbled around.\u201d\n\nThose small firms tend to be \u201cniche\u201d companies that specialize in one component or just a handful, Mackey said. Those parts, while niche, can be critical for the military to keep planes, weapons systems or other equipment operational, she said.\n\n\nBut when those small businesses encounter turmoil \u2014 from workforce challenges or programming inconsistency from the Pentagon, which is relying on continuing resolutions until formal spending bills are passed \u2014 the upheaval throws a wrench in the broader supply chains they feed.\n\n\u201cOur bottoms are closer to the bottom line,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cThere\u2019s no extra in our game. \u2026 It\u2019s not that [small businesses] need it to be easy, it just has to be consistent so we know how to engage and compete effectively.\u201d\n\nFor want of a nail\nMultiple defense firms contacted by Defense News declined to elaborate on their supply chain issues, instead pointing to statements made by executives during earnings calls or in other public forums. But even those limited statements speak volumes about how supply chain hiccups have tested the defense industry.\n\nJohn Mollard, acting chief financial officer for Lockheed Martin, said in an Oct. 26 call that larger-than-expected supply chain problems in its missiles and fire control, space, and aeronautics divisions \u2014 particularly in relation to F-35 fighter jet production \u2014 spanned multiple suppliers, leading to reduced sales in the third quarter.\n\n\nThe executive said the disruptions \u201cunderscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic.\u201d\n\nHe added that dual-use suppliers \u2014 those who make parts used by both the military and civilian aerospace sectors \u2014 accounted for much of the supply chain challenges faced by Lockheed. For example, he said, a company that makes landing gear brakes for both military and commercial aircraft saw a cash flow crunch as the pandemic kneecapped the commercial air sector.\n\nLockheed has taken steps to help its suppliers stay afloat, Mollard said, including by accelerating billions of dollars in payments to companies that make up its supply chain.\n\nHe also said Lockheed plans to keep steering payments to suppliers harmed by the pandemic \u2014 particularly small and medium-sized businesses \u2014 through the end of 2022 to ensure they can continue operations. Lockheed originally thought it would be able to cease those accelerated payments after this year, he explained.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s voluntary, it\u2019s not 100% altruistic,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWe need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful.\u201d\n\nGreg Hayes, Raytheon Technologies\u2019 chief executive, said in an Oct. 26 call that his company took a $275 million sales hit due to a combination of supply chain issues and a lack of employees. Hayes said the \u201cpeople part\u201d accounted for about a third of that $275 million loss, meaning supply chain problems cost the company about $180 million.\n\nHayes said the difficulties aren\u2019t stemming from a single supplier. \u201cThink about aluminum prices going up, think about all of the steel, all of the basic raw materials, lead times pushing out, and it\u2019s just harder to get material in the door on time,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Raytheon has benefited from long-term agreements for raw materials, he noted, lead times on some of them have doubled. He said the company has an adequate supply of computer chips, but that executives are keeping a close eye on the situation to ensure the supply doesn\u2019t fall short.\n\nHayes also said the labor shortage problem is likely to continue into the new year. The vaccine mandate could also put more pressure on the supply chain in the short term, he said, referring to an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in September requiring all federal employees and government contractors to be vaccinated, though the timeline and details have shifted on several occasions.\n\nIn the long term, he said, a higher vaccination rate could restore people\u2019s confidence in the safety of air travel, and therefore hasten economic recovery.\n\nChris Kubasik, the chief executive of L3Harris Technologies, said in the company\u2019s Oct. 29 earnings call that electronic component shortages in recent months dealt a blow to the firm \u2014 particularly in its communication systems division, as well as to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft \u2014 and led the business to slightly trim its sales growth expectations.\n\n\u201cNo company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures,\u201d Kubasik said, predicting supply chain issues will continue well into 2022, with recovery beginning in the latter half of the year.\n\nBut L3Harris has also sought workarounds. Jay Malave, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said L3Harris has looked for alternative sources and parts, and even redesigned some of its electronic components.\n\nShipbuilders have also strained at times to keep their supplies afloat. Thomas Stiehle, chief financial officer for Huntington Ingalls Industries, said in a Nov. 5 earnings call that copper cabling was one example of a material putting pressure on suppliers and the shipbuilding industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little light on material, specifically at Ingalls\u201d Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, Stiehle said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about shipbuilding, the material lag-behind [cost] roughly about $40 million in the [third] quarter. And as we look forward into [the fourth quarter], that could persist.\u201d\n\nDirk Lesko, president of General Dynamics\u2019 Bath Iron Works in Maine, told Defense News the supply chain troubles are \u201cunpredictable\u201d and apply to \u201ceverything \u2014 simple and complex things that we buy.\u201d\n\nLt. Gen. Clinton Hinote, the Air Force\u2019s deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said in a Nov. 16 online panel that the military is seeing the same supply chain issues as the civilian world. If a major conflict were to break out, the military\u2019s fragile logistics infrastructure could prove to be a vulnerability, Hinote said.\n\n\u201cWe certainly see the problems in the civilian supply chain right now,\u201d he explained. \u201cThose also manifest themselves in military supply chains. In many ways, those supply chains are brittle, and we could make decisions to make those more resilient and less brittle.\u201d","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}
{"text":"BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Belgium has raised a record 21.9 billion euros ($23.65 bln) from savers in a bond sale designed to compete with bank deposits, a sign of growing popularity for government debt as discontent grows with lenders failing to keep up with surging interest rates.\n\nThe sale, launched on Aug. 24, was aimed at pressuring banks to raise deposit rates. It marks the biggest funding drive from households in Belgium's history and is likely Europe's biggest retail bond sale, the country's debt agency said on Monday.\n\nEquivalent to around 5% of Belgian deposits, it eclipses the 5.7 billion euros raised from savers at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011 and beats the 18 billion euros Italy raised from savers earlier this year.\n\nEuropean lenders awash with cash have resisted raising savings rates while market interest rates have surged as central banks fight inflation, prompting withdrawals by households looking for better returns.\n\nBonds issued by governments targeted at savers have become a popular alternative. Italy and Portugal have this year shifted big slices of their funding programmes to households.\n\nThe scale of demand for the bond was \"a clear signal for the banks,\" Belgian finance minister Vincent Van Peteghem told Reuters, adding he had never expected the sale to prove so popular.\n\n\"Savers are giving a signal to their banks to say: we are expecting a higher return than the one that you are offering nowadays on your savings accounts. We ask at least the same respect that you have for your shareholders,\" he said.\n\nBelgium's one-year bond pays an interest rate of 3.3%, above the 2.5% and often much lower rates on savings accounts, according to aggregator website Spaargids.\n\nIT CRASH\nJean Deboutte, a director at the debt agency, said high demand led to its IT systems crashing several times during the sale.\n\n\"At one point in time we had one subscription per second.\" he said. \"That's a figure one would find with Amazon.\"\n\nAcross Europe, governments are seeking ways to compensate households taking a blow from the surging cost of living while missing out on the benefit of rising interest rates.\n\nItaly recently dealt a blow to banks with a one-off tax on their excess profits.\n\nWhile demand for the bond is high, the country's biggest lenders are yet to raise rates paid on savings accounts.\n\n\"It is now up to every bank individually to see which impact this had on their bank,\" Belgian financial sector lobby Febelfin spokesperson Isabelle Marchand said.\n\n\"This will be different for every bank, but the financial stability of every bank needs to be monitored closely.\"\n\nNoting that some institutions have raised rates or offered similar products since the bond sale, Van Peteghem said he hoped and expected bigger banks would now follow.\n\n\"If that's not happening that means that we still need to look for other tools. We can issue again another bond in December,\" he added.\n\nThe one-year maturity, shorter than Belgium's usual retail bonds, was designed to mirror savings accounts that increase the payout to savers if they lock up their money for a year.\n\nThe government has agreed a bill, pending approval, reducing the withholding tax buyers will pay to 15% to make the bond more attractive relative to savings accounts, from 30% on other Belgian retail bonds.\n\nMarchand said Febelfin had no problem with a tax-friendly bond, but added: \"the same conditions should apply to all similar investment products, and therefore there should be a level playing field.\"\n\nBelgium's debt agency said the vast size of the bond sale meant outstanding short-term debt would be reduced by more than 10 billion euros over the course of 2023, longer-debt issuance cut by over 2 billion euros and the cash reserve position increased by around 9 bln euros.","labels":["investments"]}

In this context, the Tucano Group commenced a private competitive process to seek market investors that would be willing and able to fund and take over the operations of the Mina Tucano. The Tucano Group engaged in negotiations with several potential investors, which led to the execution of fourteen confidentiality agreements and the receipt of three binding offers.\n\nPilar Gold Inc.

(\"Transaction\" and \"Tucano Resources\"). This offer was by far the best offer received by the Tucano Group from the technical and financial aspects combined, notably due to Pilar's ability to propose the best payment conditions to creditors of the Tucano Group in comparison to the other competitors, as well as to demonstrate the necessary financial conditions to swiftly resume operations in Mina Tucano and honor the offer in its entirety. Based on such offer, the Tucano Group and Tucano Gold Inc. (\"Buyer\"), a vehicle specifically constituted for the Transaction, entered into a Quota Purchase and Sale Agreement.\n\nThe Transaction comprises inter alia (i) the acquisition of the shares issued by Mina Tucano and Tucano Resources; (ii) the capitalization of Mina Tucano so that it can resume its operations at the mine site; and (iii) certain terms and conditions for the repayment of creditors of Mina Tucano. The completion of the Transaction, with the transfer of the shares of Mina Tucano and Tucano Resources to the Buyer, is subject to certain conditions precedent that are usual in transactions of this nature, including the approval of the Plan by the Judicial Reorganization creditors of the Tucano Group.\n\nMina Tucano and its Shareholders are confident that the Transaction is the best and most comprehensive solution to the challenges that led to the filing of the Judicial Reorganization, allowing an expedited continuation of the operations of Mina Tucano and therefore generation of value to creditors, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Tucano Group and the Buyer continue to hold productive discussions with the creditors of the Tucano Group, which we expect to lead to a Plan approval in the next general meeting of creditors scheduled for September 15, 2023.\n\nThe Company will continue keeping its creditors informed about the development of the matters addressed under this notice and is available for any clarification the creditors deem necessary.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a deep impact on transport connectivity in the region as documented in the recent ESCAP Policy Brief on Policy Reponses to Covid-19: Transport Connectivity in Asia and the Pacific. To prevent spread of the virus, within weeks, countries closed their borders to passenger transport and placed varying restrictions on freight transportation disrupting the supply chains. \n\nGovernments of the region need to respond to this pandemic appropriately by not only minimizing the short-term disruptions to transport linkages, but also viewing the crisis as an opportunity to revisit and reset the international freight transport operations towards a more sustainable path.\n\nOne major trend that has emerged in international freight transport in these challenging times is the increase in the number of freight trains between China and Europe. According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, freight trains between China and Europe increased by 15 per cent to 1,941 and number of containers transported by 18 per cent to 174,000 in the first quarter of 2020.  \n\nWhile all other modes of international freight transport have been adversely affected by the pandemic- the increase in freight carried by railways is not surprising, given its distinct features, that are working to its advantage in the current situation. \n\nInternational railway transport uses less manpower over long distance and accordingly there are fewer quarantine checks, unlike, for example, in road transport where congestions at border crossings cause more frequent human interactions.  Each freight train can carry between 40 to 70 times equivalent of lorry loads of goods in a much more safe and secure environment giving rail a distinct advantage. \n\nTraffic at a typical railway border crossing can also be managed much more effectively as compared to a road border crossing, thus the former has much less potential of spreading the virus due to transport process. \n\nAlso, for landlocked developing countries, the disruptions caused by the pandemic would be felt more acutely as they already suffer from high transport cost. International railway transport would be more effective for these countries in the current situation to minimize current disruptions and subsequent bounce back.\n\nTo meet the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic, international freight trains are being used to transport medical supplies and related equipment to many European countries. The railways of the region are also taking other measures to mitigate the impact caused by the pandemic as indicated on the websites of the mentioned railways. \n\nFor example, Russian Railways has set up an Emergency Response Center to support shippers and enhance coordination of all links in the transport chain to control spread of virus. Turkish Railways is undertaking freight transport with Iran without human contact and all freight trains are disinfected both before and after the trip. Uzbekistan Railways has developed a software for processing and providing preliminary electronic information to customs authorities for goods transported by rail.\n\nESCAP has engaged its member railways for many years to strengthen international railway transport. Its effort in this direction led to entry into force in 2009, an intergovernmental agreement on Trans-Asian Railway Network, that serves as a coordinated platform for development of railways in the region. \n\nTo facilitate railway transport along the network, in 2015, resolution 71\/7 Regional Cooperation Framework on Facilitation of International Railway Transport was adopted  by the member countries that identified key areas for cooperation among railways of the region to facilitate international railway transport. \n\nMore recently, at the Sixth Meeting of the Working Group on the Trans-Asian Railway Network, the importance of reducing the border crossing delays along the long-distance railway corridors was emphasized by taking action on four key issues. \n\nThese include (a) electronic information exchange between railways and among railways and control agencies; (b) harmonizing customs formalities for transit by rail; (c) dealing efficiently with break-of-gauge; and (d) developing comprehensive indicators and methodology to measure the performance of railway border crossing. \n\nESCAP is also supporting initiatives to commercialize railway corridors involving landlocked developing countries by developing corridor management mechanism(s) to increase coordination among the railways and other stakeholders along the corridor for efficient operations. \n\nConcrete action on these initiatives, over medium to long-run, would greatly enhance the efficiency of international freight trains and further reduce transport time as well cost and boost sustainability of international freight transport operations, helping the region \u201cbuild back better\u201d and shift to a new, more sustainable, \u201cnormal\u201d in the post-COVID-19 world. \n\nHistory is replete with challenges faced by the mankind and its resilience to come better out of them. The wide scale disruptions cause by the COVID-19 pandemic would undoubtedly make the path towards realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development more challenging. \n\nThe existing situation, therefore, should be leveraged by taking concrete policy measures to enhance reliability of international freight trains making them competitive and self-sustaining. This would augment sustainability of the freight transport networks and thereby support countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n \n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

It is vital for Diamond to continue carrying local games on its networks. Since its filing, it has already seen some teams leave its Bally Sports channels due to a breakdown in rights fees discussions.\n\nThe prospect of local game rights being up for grabs has attracted broadcast station owners \u2013 including Nexstar Media Group\n, Gray Television\n and E.W.

On top of this, Diamond alleges Sinclair, in a \u201cnefarious strategy ... wrongfully caused Diamond to transfer more than $1.5 billion in cash and other consideration for the benefit of Sinclair.\u201d\n\nThis occurred as Diamond alleges Sinclair knew the RSN business was \u201ccareering toward bankruptcy, and it continued after Diamond was unquestionably insolvent.\u201d\n\n\u201cSinclair has been informed of a lawsuit filed by Diamond Sports Group in connection with their ongoing bankruptcy proceeding. We firmly believe the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them,\u201d a Sinclair spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nDiamond appointed a new board and leadership last year to run its RSN business as it faced an inevitable bankruptcy filing. Diamond is now an unconsolidated and independently run subsidiary of Sinclair.","labels":["financial_distress"]}

Existing shareholders are selling 7.9 million shares at the same price.\n\nInstacart is seeking a valuation of about $7.7 billion at the top end of the range based on the current number of shares outstanding in its IPO filing. That\u2019s before taking into account the potential settlement of restricted stock units granted to employees, which could push the valuation higher.\n\nWhile not finalized, the company\u2019s valuation in the IPO marks a big drop from the pandemic-induced surge in business for Instacart. In 2021, it was valued at $39 billion, according to data provider PitchBook. As the pandemic waned and diners began to emerge from lockdowns and return to restaurants and grocery aisles, Instacart\u2019s growth faded too, forcing it to slash its internal valuation three times last year to about $13 billion by October.\n\nIn conjunction with the IPO, PepsiCo Inc. is buying $175 million of its preferred convertible stock, Instacart said. The company is considering pricing its listing Sept. 19, with trading starting the following day, Bloomberg News has reported previously.\n\nInstacart\u2019s listing could help unstick the backlog of companies whose plans to go public have been stymied by the longest lull in US listings since the financial crisis in 2009. The largest of those companies is Arm Holdings Ltd., the semiconductor designer owned by SoftBank Group Corp. that is planning to raise as much as $4.87 billion later this week.\n\nOthers that have either already filed for IPOs or are pursuing them include marketing and data automation provider Klaviyo, Vietnam-based internet startup VNG Ltd. and footwear maker Birkenstock.\n\nSan Francisco-based Instacart, which is incorporated as Maplebear Inc. and filed under that name, saw its revenue grow 31% to about $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, aided by supercharged growth in its higher-margin advertising segment.

{"text":"BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Belgium has raised a record 21.9 billion euros ($23.65 bln) from savers in a bond sale designed to compete with bank deposits, a sign of growing popularity for government debt as discontent grows with lenders failing to keep up with surging interest rates.\n\nThe sale, launched on Aug. 24, was aimed at pressuring banks to raise deposit rates. It marks the biggest funding drive from households in Belgium's history and is likely Europe's biggest retail bond sale, the country's debt agency said on Monday.\n\nEquivalent to around 5% of Belgian deposits, it eclipses the 5.7 billion euros raised from savers at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011 and beats the 18 billion euros Italy raised from savers earlier this year.\n\nEuropean lenders awash with cash have resisted raising savings rates while market interest rates have surged as central banks fight inflation, prompting withdrawals by households looking for better returns.\n\nBonds issued by governments targeted at savers have become a popular alternative. Italy and Portugal have this year shifted big slices of their funding programmes to households.\n\nThe scale of demand for the bond was \"a clear signal for the banks,\" Belgian finance minister Vincent Van Peteghem told Reuters, adding he had never expected the sale to prove so popular.\n\n\"Savers are giving a signal to their banks to say: we are expecting a higher return than the one that you are offering nowadays on your savings accounts. We ask at least the same respect that you have for your shareholders,\" he said.\n\nBelgium's one-year bond pays an interest rate of 3.3%, above the 2.5% and often much lower rates on savings accounts, according to aggregator website Spaargids.\n\nIT CRASH\nJean Deboutte, a director at the debt agency, said high demand led to its IT systems crashing several times during the sale.\n\n\"At one point in time we had one subscription per second.\" he said. \"That's a figure one would find with Amazon.\"\n\nAcross Europe, governments are seeking ways to compensate households taking a blow from the surging cost of living while missing out on the benefit of rising interest rates.\n\nItaly recently dealt a blow to banks with a one-off tax on their excess profits.\n\nWhile demand for the bond is high, the country's biggest lenders are yet to raise rates paid on savings accounts.\n\n\"It is now up to every bank individually to see which impact this had on their bank,\" Belgian financial sector lobby Febelfin spokesperson Isabelle Marchand said.\n\n\"This will be different for every bank, but the financial stability of every bank needs to be monitored closely.\"\n\nNoting that some institutions have raised rates or offered similar products since the bond sale, Van Peteghem said he hoped and expected bigger banks would now follow.\n\n\"If that's not happening that means that we still need to look for other tools. We can issue again another bond in December,\" he added.\n\nThe one-year maturity, shorter than Belgium's usual retail bonds, was designed to mirror savings accounts that increase the payout to savers if they lock up their money for a year.\n\nThe government has agreed a bill, pending approval, reducing the withholding tax buyers will pay to 15% to make the bond more attractive relative to savings accounts, from 30% on other Belgian retail bonds.\n\nMarchand said Febelfin had no problem with a tax-friendly bond, but added: \"the same conditions should apply to all similar investment products, and therefore there should be a level playing field.\"\n\nBelgium's debt agency said the vast size of the bond sale meant outstanding short-term debt would be reduced by more than 10 billion euros over the course of 2023, longer-debt issuance cut by over 2 billion euros and the cash reserve position increased by around 9 bln euros.","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"The Ebola outbreak created a demand for personal protective equipment. Clinics can go through hundreds of PPE suits a day. Manufacturers increased production but agencies say there's still a shortage.\n\nWe're hearing a lot in today's program about the people who care for patients with Ebola. There is a shortage of suits to protect them.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nHealth care workers are supposed to wear personal protective equipment, or PPEs. They cover every part of the body, from the hood and goggles, to gloves and coveralls, down to the boots.\n\nINSKEEP: PPEs are in short supply because clinics in West Africa can go through hundreds in a single day. NPR's Jackie Northam reports.\n\nJACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: For one month earlier this fall, Dr. Massoud Javadi spent many hours of the day wearing head-to-toe protective gear, or PPE. The Houston doctor was in Foya, a small town in northern Liberia. He worked at a clinic set up by Doctors Without Borders. Javadi was surrounded by more than a hundred Ebola patients, but he says he wasn't worried.\n\nMASSOUD JAVADI: When you're in the isolation unit in your PPE outfit, that's pretty much the safest place to be. You're surrounded by people, but you have maximum protection on.\n\nNORTHAM: You can buy a full protective outfit for as cheap as $15 online. But Doctors Without Borders uses a higher-quality PPE, costing about $75 apiece. Javadi says they are thick and unwieldy and particularly tough in the extreme heat.\n\nJAVADI: After about 30 or 40 minutes, your goggles have fogged up; your socks are completely drenched in sweat. You're just walking in water in your boots. And at that point, you have to exit for your own safety.\n\nNORTHAM: Javadi says many people - doctors, nurses, people recovering the dead - wear the PPEs and that his clinic occasionally ran low on stocks. More had to be brought in from other centers. He says the apron and boots can be disinfected and reused. Everything else must be destroyed.\n\nJAVADI: The gloves and the gowns and the masks, those are all disposable and must be burned. And we go through a lot of them, boxes and boxes every day.\n\nNORTHAM: Doctors Without borders says it has about 25,000 protective clothing kits in each of its half-a-dozen clinics spread across Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - about a two-month supply. But the Centers for Disease Control says the number of Ebola victims is increasing exponentially and could reach tens of thousands by the end of the year. That's created a surge in demand for the PPEs. Dupont, a major manufacturer, says it has recently tripled its production. Kimberly-Clark has also increased production, says Judson Boothe, the company's senior product supply director.\n\nJUDSON BOOTHE: We've had ministries. We've also had non-government organizations that are trying to get product all the way down to communities and then certainly the health care networks within those regions are trying to respond and fill out their stockpiles as well.\n\nNORTHAM: The United Nations say the World Health Organization plans to send about 400,000 PPEs to West Africa and that 3M is also working on a plan to provide up to half-a-million a month. The Japanese government will donate another half-a-million from its stockpiles. But aid agencies such as UNICEF and AmeriCares says that the current ongoing demand isn't being met. Boothe maintains there are enough PPEs available, but getting them to the agencies is challenging. He says part of the problem is a complicated ineffective supply chain involving too many distributors and intermediaries.\n\nBOOTHE: Sometimes, you do get speculators that try to turn this into a profit exercise where they have investors, and they try to buy up a lot of stuff. And then they try to sell it at the highest price to the highest bidder. And then also, some of it is just dealing with distributors who are dealing with even other layers of distributors. And these products are passing hands three and four times.\n\nNORTHAM: Boothe says it would be more efficient if all the agencies coordinated through one large entity such as the World Health Organization. Michael Rettig is the executive director of LIFT, a disaster logistics company which is shuttling supplies into Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. He says there were reports of the PPEs not making it to the clinics in West Africa because of what he calls shrinkage.\n\nMICHAEL RETTIG: We know that there were some shipments that went into Liberia and within a few days ended up on the black market.\n\nNORTHAM: Rettig says his company has set up a system to prevent such theft. But he says another headache is logistics. Most of the PPEs will go through Monrovia. He says the airport there only has the capacity to unload two, maybe three, aircraft a day, which could be a challenge when more cargo starts arriving.

{"text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 UBS will pay U.S. authorities $1.44 billion to settle the last lingering legal case over Wall Street\u2019s role in the housing bubble of the early 2000s, which ultimately led to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nThe Swiss bank agreed to pay a civil penalty over how it handled the sale of 40 mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007. The settlement argues that UBS bankers gave false and misleading statements about the health of the mortgages in those bonds to the buyers in violation of federal securities law.\n\nFor example, UBS bankers knew that the underlying mortgages in these bonds were poorly underwritten or violated consumer protection laws. The bonds in question ended up with substantial losses for investors.\n\nWith the UBS settlement, the last remaining outstanding legal case from the Great Recession has now come to a close, the Justice Department said. Banks paid collectively more than $36 billion in civil penalties for their conduct related to the mortgage crisis, but that does not include other settlements that banks have made to state and local authorities as well.\n\nUBS said that it already had set aside funds for the settlement, so it will not impact its financial results.\n\nSeparately Monday, Swiss media reported that two groups acting on behalf of Credit Suisse shareholders filed suit in Swiss courts to argue that the sale price to UBS \u2013 around $3.25 billion \u2013 far undervalued the bank, and that UBS was able to unjustly profit from the deal.\n\nThe Swiss government hastily arranged the takeover in March of Credit Suisse, which had been facing years of turmoil and an exodus of shareholders, by longtime rival UBS to help avert a global financial crisis.\n\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"When Russian forces marched on Kyiv in February 2022, few thought Ukraine could survive. Russia had more than twice as many soldiers as Ukraine. Its military budget was more than ten times as large. The U.S. intelligence community estimated that Kyiv would fall within one to two weeks at most.\n\nOutgunned and outmanned, Ukraine turned to one area in which it held an advantage over the enemy: technology. Shortly after the invasion, the Ukrainian government uploaded all its critical data to the cloud, so that it could safeguard information and keep functioning even if Russian missiles turned its ministerial offices into rubble. The country\u2019s Ministry of Digital Transformation, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had established just two years earlier, repurposed its e-government mobile app, Diia, for open-source intelligence collection, so that citizens could upload photos and videos of enemy military units. With their communications infrastructure in jeopardy, the Ukrainians turned to Starlink satellites and ground stations provided by SpaceX to stay connected. When Russia sent Iranian-made drones across the border, Ukraine acquired its own drones specially designed to intercept their attacks\u2014while its military learned how to use unfamiliar weapons supplied by Western allies. In the cat-and-mouse game of innovation, Ukraine simply proved nimbler. And so what Russia had imagined would be a quick and easy invasion has turned out to be anything but.\n\nUkraine\u2019s success can be credited in part to the resolve of the Ukrainian people, the weakness of the Russian military, and the strength of Western support. But it also owes to the defining new force of international politics: innovation power. Innovation power is the ability to invent, adopt, and adapt new technologies. It contributes to both hard and soft power. High-tech weapons systems increase military might, new platforms and the standards that govern them provide economic leverage, and cutting-edge research and technologies enhance global appeal. There is a long tradition of states harnessing innovation to project power abroad, but what has changed is the self-perpetuating nature of scientific advances. Developments in artificial intelligence in particular not only unlock new areas of scientific discovery; they also speed up that very process. Artificial intelligence supercharges the ability of scientists and engineers to discover ever more powerful technologies, fostering advances in artificial intelligence itself as well as in other fields\u2014and reshaping the world in the process.\n\nThe ability to innovate faster and better\u2014the foundation on which military, economic, and cultural power now rest\u2014will determine the outcome of the great-power competition between the United States and China. For now, the United States remains in the lead. But China is catching up in many areas and has already surged ahead in others. To emerge victorious from this century-defining contest, business as usual will not do. Instead, the U.S. government will have to overcome its stultified bureaucratic impulses, create favorable conditions for innovation, and invest in the tools and talent needed to kick-start the virtuous cycle of technological advancement. It needs to commit itself to promoting innovation in the service of the country and in the service of democracy. At stake is nothing less than the future of free societies, open markets, democratic government, and the broader world order.\n\nKNOWLEDGE IS POWER\nThe nexus between technological innovation and global domination dates back centuries, from the muskets the conquistador Francisco Pizarro wielded to defeat the Inca Empire to the steamboats Commodore Matthew Perry commanded to force the opening of Japan. But the sheer speed at which innovation is happening has no precedent. Nowhere is this change clearer than in one of the foundational technologies of our time: artificial intelligence.\n\nToday\u2019s AI systems can already provide key advantages in the military domain, where they are able to parse millions of inputs, identify patterns, and alert commanders to enemy activity. The Ukrainian military, for example, has used AI to efficiently scan intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data from a variety of sources. Increasingly, however, AI systems will move beyond merely assisting human decision-making and start making decisions themselves. John Boyd, a military strategist and U.S. Air Force colonel, coined the term \u201cOODA loop\u201d\u2014observe, orient, decide, act\u2014to describe the decision-making process in combat. Crucially, AI will be able to execute each part of the OODA loop much faster. Conflict can happen at the speed of computers, not the speed of people. As a result, command-and-control systems that rely on human decision-makers\u2014or, worse, complex military hierarchies\u2014will lose out to faster, more efficient systems that team machines with humans.\n\nIn previous eras, the technologies that shaped geopolitics\u2014from bronze to steel, steam power to nuclear fission\u2014were largely singular. There was a clear threshold of technological mastery, and once a country reached it, the playing field was leveled. Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is generative in nature. By presenting a platform for continuous scientific and technological innovation, it can lead to yet more innovation. That phenomenon makes the AI age fundamentally different from the Bronze Age or the steel age. Rather than natural resource wealth or mastery of a given technology, the source of a country\u2019s power now lies in its ability to continuously innovate.\n\nThis virtuous cycle will only get faster and faster. Once quantum computing comes of age, superfast computers will allow for the processing of ever-larger amounts of data, producing ever-smarter AI systems. These AI systems, in turn, will be able to produce breakthrough innovations in other emerging fields, from synthetic biology to semiconductor manufacturing. Artificial intelligence will change the very nature of scientific research. Instead of making progress one study at a time, scientists will discover the answers to age-old questions by analyzing massive data sets, freeing the world\u2019s smartest minds to devote more time to developing new ideas. As a foundational technology, AI will be critical in the race for innovation power, lying behind countless future developments in drug discovery, gene therapy, material science, and clean energy\u2014and in AI itself. Faster airplanes did not help build faster airplanes, but faster computers will help build faster computers. \n\nEven more powerful than today\u2019s artificial intelligence is a more comprehensive technology\u2014for now, given current computing power, still hypothetical\u2014called \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d or AGI. Whereas traditional AI is designed to solve a discrete problem, AGI should be able to perform any mental task a human can and more. Imagine an AI system that could answer seemingly intractable questions, such as the best way to teach a million children English or to treat a case of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The advent of AGI remains years, perhaps even decades, away, but whichever country develops the technology first will have a massive advantage, since it could then use AGI to develop ever more advanced versions of AGI, gaining an edge in all other domains of science and technology in the process. A breakthrough in this field could usher in an era of predominance not unlike the short period of nuclear superiority the United States enjoyed in the late 1940s.\n\n\n\nTesting a homemade drone in Kyiv, November 2022\nWhereas many of AI\u2019s most transformative effects are still far off, innovation in drones is already upending the battlefield. In 2020, Azerbaijan employed Turkish- and Israeli-made drones to gain a decisive advantage in its war against Armenia in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, racking up battlefield victories after more than two decades of military stalemate. Similarly, Ukraine\u2019s fleet of drones\u2014many of which are low-cost commercial models repurposed for reconnaissance behind enemy lines\u2014have played a critical role in its successes.\n\nDrones offer distinct advantages over traditional weapons: they are smaller and cheaper, offer unmatched surveillance capabilities, and reduce soldiers\u2019 risk exposure. Marines in urban warfare, for example, could be accompanied by microdrones that serve as their eyes and ears. Over time, countries will improve the hardware and software powering drones to outinnovate their rivals. Eventually, autonomous weaponized drones\u2014not just unmanned aerial vehicles but also ground-based ones\u2014will replace soldiers and manned artillery altogether. Imagine an autonomous submarine that could quickly move supplies into contested waters or an autonomous truck that could find the optimal route to carry small missile launchers across rough terrain. Swarms of drones, networked and coordinated by AI, could overwhelm tank and infantry formations in the field. In the Black Sea, Ukraine has used drones to attack Russian ships and supply vessels, helping a country with a minuscule navy constrain Russia\u2019s mighty Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine offers a preview of future conflicts: wars that will be waged and won by humans and machines working together.\n\nAs developments in drones make clear, innovation power underlies military power. First and foremost, technological dominance in crucial domains bolsters a country\u2019s ability to wage war and thus strengthens its deterrent capabilities. But innovation also shapes economic power by giving states leverage over supply chains and the ability to make the rules for others. Countries reliant on natural resources or trade, especially those that must import rare or foundational goods, face vulnerabilities others do not.\n\nConsider the power China can wield over the countries it supplies with communications hardware. It is no surprise that countries dependent on Chinese-supplied infrastructure\u2014such as many countries in Africa, where components produced by Huawei make up about 70 percent of 4G networks\u2014have been loath to criticize Chinese human rights violations. Taiwan\u2019s primacy in semiconductor manufacturing, likewise, provides a powerful deterrent against invasion, since China has little interest in destroying its largest source of microchips. Leverage also accrues to countries pioneering new technologies. The United States, thanks to its role in the foundation of the Internet, has for decades enjoyed a seat at the table defining Internet regulations. During the Arab Spring, for example, the fact that the United States was home to technology companies that provided the backbone of the Internet enabled those companies to refuse Arab governments\u2019 censorship requests.\n\nLess obvious but also crucial, technological innovation buoys a country\u2019s soft power. Hollywood and tech companies such as Netflix and YouTube have built up a trove of content for an increasingly global consumer base\u2014all the while, helping spread American values. Such streaming services project the American way of life into living rooms around the world. Similarly, the prestige associated with U.S. universities and the opportunities for wealth creation created by U.S. companies attract strivers from across the globe. In short, a country\u2019s ability to project power in the international sphere\u2014militarily, economically, and culturally\u2014depends on its ability to innovate faster and better than its competitors.\n\nRACE TO THE TOP\nThe main reason innovation now lends such a massive advantage is that it begets more innovation. In part, it does so because of the path dependency that arises from clusters of scientists attracting, teaching, and training other great scientists at research universities and large technology companies. But it also does so because innovation builds on itself. Innovation relies on a loop of invention, adoption, and adaptation\u2014a feedback cycle that fuels yet more innovation. If any link in the chain breaks, so, too, does a country\u2019s ability to innovate effectively.\n\nA lead in invention is typically built on years of prior research. Consider the way the United States led the world into the 4G era of telecommunications. The rollout of 4G networks across the country facilitated the early development of mobile applications such as Uber that required faster cellular data connections. With that lead, Uber was able to refine its product in the United States so it could roll it out in developing countries. This led to many more customers\u2014and much more feedback to incorporate\u2014as the company adapted its product for new markets and new releases.\n\nBut the moat around countries that enjoy structural advantages in technology is shrinking. Thanks in part to more accessible academic research and the rise of open-source software, technologies now diffuse more quickly around the world. The availability of new advances has helped competitors catch up at record speed, as China eventually did in 4G. Although some of China\u2019s recent technological success stems from economic espionage and a disregard for patents, much of it traces back to innovative, rather than derivative, efforts to adapt and implement new technology.\n\nIndeed, Chinese companies have enjoyed resounding success in adopting and commercializing foreign technological breakthroughs. In 2015, the Chinese Communist Party laid out its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy to achieve self-sufficiency in high-tech industries such as telecommunications and AI. As part of this bid, it announced an economic plan of \u201cdual circulation,\u201d whereby China intends to boost both domestic and foreign demand for its goods. Through public-private partnerships, direct subsidies to private companies, and support for state-backed companies, Beijing has poured billions of dollars into ensuring it comes out ahead in the race for technological supremacy. So far, the record is mixed. China is ahead of the United States in some technologies yet lags in others.\n\n\n\nAt a semiconductor factory in Huai'an, China, September 2022\nIt is hard to say whether China will seize the lead in AI, but top officials in Beijing certainly think it will. In 2017, Beijing announced plans to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, and it may achieve that goal even earlier than expected. China has already accomplished its goal of becoming the world\u2019s leader in AI-based surveillance technology, which it not only uses to control dissidents at home but also sells to authoritarian governments abroad. China still ranks behind the United States in attracting the best minds in AI, with almost 60 percent of top-tier researchers working in U.S. universities. But China\u2019s loose privacy laws, mandatory data collection, and targeted government funding give the country a key advantage. Indeed, it already leads in the production of autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor now, the United States still retains an edge in quantum computing. Yet over the past decade, China has invested at least $10 billion in quantum technology, roughly ten times as much as the U.S. government. China is working to build quantum computers so powerful that they will easily crack today\u2019s encryption. The country is also investing heavily in quantum networks\u2014a way of transmitting information in the form of quantum bits\u2014presumably in the hope that such networks would be impervious to monitoring by other intelligence agencies. Even more alarming, the Chinese government may already be storing stolen and intercepted communications with an eye to decrypting them once it possesses the computing power to do so, a strategy known as \u201cstore now, decrypt later.\u201d When quantum computers become fast enough, all communications encrypted through non-quantum methods will be at risk for interception, raising the stakes of achieving this breakthrough first.\n\nChina is also actively trying to catch up with the United States in synthetic biology. Scientists in this field are working on a range of new biological developments, including microbe-made cement that absorbs carbon dioxide, crops with an increased ability to sequester carbon, and plant-based meat substitutes. Such technology holds enormous promise to fight climate change and create jobs, but since 2019, Chinese private investment in synthetic biology has outpaced U.S. investment.\n\nWhen it comes to semiconductors, China has ambitious plans, too. The Chinese government is funding unprecedented efforts to become a leader in semiconductor manufacturing by 2030. Chinese companies are currently creating what are known in the industry as \u201cseven nanometer\u201d chips, but Beijing has set its sights further, announcing plans to domestically produce the new generation of \u201cfive nanometer\u201d chips. For now, the United States continues to outperform China in semiconductor design, as do U.S.-aligned Taiwan and South Korea. In October 2022, the Biden administration took the important step of blocking leading U.S. companies producing AI computer chips from selling to China as part of a package of restrictions released by the Department of Commerce. Yet Chinese companies control 85 percent of the processing of the rare-earth minerals that go into these chips and other critical electronics, offering an important point of leverage over their competitors. \n\nA BATTLE OF SYSTEMS\nThe competition between the United States and China is as much a competition between systems as it is between states. In the Chinese model of civil-military fusion, the government promotes domestic competition and funds emerging winners as \u201cnational champions.\u201d These companies play a dual role, maximizing commercial success and advancing Chinese national security interests. The American model, on the other hand, relies on a more disparate set of private actors. The federal government provides funding to basic science but largely leaves innovation and commercialization to the market. \n\nFor a long time, the trifecta of government, industry, and academia was the primary source of American innovation. This collaboration drove many technological breakthroughs, from the moon landing to the Internet. But with the end of the Cold War, the U.S. government grew averse to allocating funding for applied research, and it even lowered the amount devoted to fundamental research. Although private spending has taken off, public investments have plateaued over the past half century. In 2015, the share of government funding for basic research dropped below 50 percent for the first time since the end of World War II, having hovered around 70 percent in the 1960s. Meanwhile, the geometry of innovation\u2014the respective role of public and private players in driving technological progress\u2014has changed since the Cold War, in ways that have not always yielded what the country needs. The rise of venture capital helped accelerate adoption and commercialization, but it did little to address higher-order scientific problems.\n\nThe reasons for Washington\u2019s reluctance to fund the science that serves as the foundation of innovation power are structural. Innovation requires risk and, at times, failure\u2014something politicians are loath to accept. Innovation can demand long-term investments, but the U.S. government operates on a single-year budget cycle and, at most, a two-year political cycle. Despite these obstacles, Silicon Valley (along with other hot spots in the United States) has still managed to encourage innovation. The American success story relies on a potent mix of inspiring ambition, startup-friendly legal and tax regimes, and a culture of openness that allows entrepreneurs and researchers to iterate and improve on new ideas.\n\n\nThe United States\u2019 outdated immigration system prevents too many talented people from coming.\nThat may not be enough, however. Government support has long played a critical role in jump-starting innovation in the United States, and research in technologies that seem outlandish now may prove critical in the not-too-distant future. In 2013, for example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency invested in messenger RNA vaccines, working with the biotech company Moderna, which would later develop and deliver a COVID-19 vaccine in record time. But such examples are rarer than they should be.\n\nCompetition with China demands a reenergizing of the interplay among the government, the private sector, and academia. Just as the Cold War led to the creation of the National Security Council, today\u2019s tech-fueled competition should spur a rethinking of existing policymaking structures. As the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (which I chaired) recommended, a new \u201ctechnology competitiveness council,\u201d inspired by the NSC, could help coordinate action among private actors and develop a national plan to advance crucial emerging technologies. In a promising sign, Congress appears to have recognized the need for decisive support. In 2022, in a bipartisan vote, it passed the CHIPS and Science Act, which directs $200 billion in funding for scientific R & D over the next ten years.\n\nINVESTING IN THE FUTURE\nAs part of its effort to ensure that it remains an innovation superpower, the United States will need to invest billions of dollars in key areas of technological competition. In semiconductors, perhaps the most vital technology today, the U.S. government should redouble its efforts to onshore and \u201cfriend shore\u201d supply chains, relocating them to the United States or friendly countries. In renewable energy, it should fund R & D for microelectronics, stockpile the rare-earth minerals (such as lithium and cobalt) needed for batteries and electric vehicles, and invest in new technologies that can replace lithium-ion batteries and offset China\u2019s resource dominance. Meanwhile, the rollout of 5G in the United States has been slow, in part because government agencies\u2014most notably, the Department of Defense\u2014control most of the high-frequency radio spectrum that 5G uses. To catch up with China, the Pentagon should open up more of the spectrum to private actors.\n\nThe United States will need to invest in all parts of the innovation cycle, funding not just basic research but also commercialization. Meaningful innovation requires both invention and implementation, the ability to execute and commercialize new inventions at scale. This is often the main stumbling block. Research in electric cars, for example, helped General Motors bring its first model onto the market in 1996, but it took two more decades before Tesla mass-produced a commercially viable model. Every new technology, from AI to quantum computing to synthetic biology, must be pursued with the clear goal of commercialization.\n\nIn addition to directly investing in the technologies that fuel innovation power, the United States must invest in the input that lies at the core of innovation: talent. The United States boasts the world\u2019s top startups, incumbent companies, and universities, all of which attract the best and the brightest from around the world. Yet too many talented people are prevented from coming to the United States by its outdated immigration system. Instead of creating an easy path to a green card for foreigners who earn STEM degrees from American schools, the current system makes it needlessly difficult for top graduates to contribute to the U.S. economy.\n\nThe United States has an asymmetric advantage when it comes to employing highly skilled immigrants, and its enviable living standards and abundant opportunities explain why the country has attracted most of the world\u2019s brightest AI minds. More than half of all AI researchers working in the United States hail from abroad, and the demand for AI talent still far exceeds supply. If the United States closes its doors to talented immigrants, it risks losing its innovative edge. Just as the Manhattan Project was led in large part by refugees and \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Europe, the next American technological breakthrough will almost certainly rely on immigrants. \n\nTHE BEST DEFENSE\nAs part of its efforts to translate innovation into hard power, the United States must fundamentally rethink some of its defense policies. During the Cold War, the country designed various \u201coffset\u201d strategies to counterbalance Soviet numerical superiority through military strategy and technological innovations. Today, Washington needs what the Special Competitive Studies Project has called an \u201cOffset-X\u201d strategy, a competitive approach through which the United States can maintain technological and military superiority.\n\nGiven how much modern militaries and economies rely on digital infrastructure, any future great-power war is likely to start with a cyberstrike. The United States\u2019 cyberdefenses, therefore, need a response time faster than humans\u2019 reaction time. Having faced constant cyberattacks even in peacetime, the United States should armor itself with redundancy, creating backup systems and alternative paths for data flows.\n\nWhat starts in cyberspace could easily escalate into the physical realm, and there, too, the United States will need to meet new challenges. To counter possible swarm drone attacks, it must invest in defensive artillery and missile systems. To improve battlefield awareness, the U.S. military should focus on deploying a network of inexpensive sensors powered by AI to monitor contested areas, an approach that is often more effective than a single, exquisitely crafted system. As human intelligence becomes harder to obtain, the United States must increasingly rely on the largest constellation of sensors of any country, ranging from undersea to outer space. It will also need to focus more on open-source intelligence, given that most of the world\u2019s data today is publicly available. Without this capability, the United States risks being surprised by its intelligence failures.\n\n\nIn the contest of the century\u2014the U.S. rivalry with China\u2014the deciding factor will be innovation power.\nWhen it comes to actual fighting, military units should be networked and decentralized to better outmaneuver opponents. Facing adversaries with rigid military hierarchies, the United States could gain an advantage by using smaller, more connected units whose members are adept at network-based decision-making, employing the tools of artificial intelligence to their advantage. For example, a single unit could bring together capabilities in intelligence collection, long-range missile attacks, and electronic warfare. The Pentagon needs to provide battlefield commanders with all the best information and allow them to make the best choices on the ground.\n\nThe U.S. military must also learn to integrate new technologies into its procurement process, battle plans, and warfighting. In the four years that I chaired the Defense Innovation Board, I was astounded by how difficult this was to do. A major bottleneck is the Pentagon\u2019s burdensome procurement process: major weapons systems take more than ten years to design, develop, and deploy. The Department of Defense should look for inspiration in the way the tech industry designs products. It should build missiles the way companies now build electric cars, using a design studio to develop and simulate software, looking for innovations ten times as fast and as cost-effective as current processes. The current procurement system is especially ill suited for a future in which software primacy proves decisive on the battlefield.\n\nThe United States spends four times as much as any other country to procure military systems, but price is a poor metric for judging innovation power. In April 2022, Ukrainian forces fired two Neptune missiles at the Moskva, a 600-foot Russian warship, sinking the vessel. The ship cost $750 million; the missiles, $500,000 apiece. Likewise, China\u2019s state-of-the-art hypersonic antiship missile, the YJ-21, could someday sink a $10 billion U.S. aircraft carrier. The U.S. government should think twice before committing another $10 billion and ten years to such a vessel. It often makes more sense to buy many low-cost items instead of investing in a few high-ticket prestige projects.\n\nPLAYING TO WIN\nIn the contest of the century\u2014the U.S. rivalry with China\u2014the deciding factor will be innovation power. Technological advances in the next five to ten years will determine which country gains the upper hand in this world-shaping competition. The challenge for the United States, however, is that government officials are incentivized to avoid risk and focus on the short term, leaving the country to chronically underinvest in the technologies of the future.\n\nIf necessity is the mother of invention, war is the midwife of innovation. Speaking to Ukrainians on a visit to Kyiv in the fall of 2022, I heard from many that the first months of the war were the most productive of their lives. The United States\u2019 last truly global war\u2014World War II\u2014led to the widespread adoption of penicillin, a revolution in nuclear technology, and a breakthrough in computer science. Now, the United States must innovate in peacetime, faster than ever before. By failing to do so, it is eroding its ability to deter\u2014and, if necessary, to fight and win\u2014the next war.\n\nThe alternative could be disastrous. Hypersonic missiles could leave the United States defenseless, and cyberattacks could cripple the country\u2019s electric grid. Perhaps even more important, the warfare of the future will target individuals in completely new ways: authoritarian states such as China and Russia may be able to collect individual data on Americans\u2019 shopping habits, location, and even DNA profiles, allowing for tailor-made disinformation campaigns and even targeted biological attacks and assassinations. To avert these horrors, the United States needs to make sure it remains ahead of its technological competitors.\n\nThe principles that have defined life in the United States\u2014freedom, capitalism, individual effort\u2014were the right ones for the past and remain so for the future. These basic values lie at the foundation of an innovation ecosystem that is still the envy of the world. They have enabled breakthroughs that have transformed everyday life around the world. The United States started the innovation race in pole position, but it cannot rest assured it will remain there. Silicon Valley\u2019s old mantra holds true not just in industry but also in geopolitics: innovate or die","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}

{"text":"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company run by the world\u2019s richest man. It has come from nowhere to be an online behemoth in less than one-quarter of a century. Yet even the biggest company, this behemoth of behemoths, is vulnerable to concerted political pressure and has to live with the basic laws of demand and supply.\n\nThat, put simply, is the explanation for Amazon\u2019s announcement of seriously big increases in minimum wages for its workers in the US and Britain. On the other side of the Atlantic, no worker will be earning less than $15 (\u00a311.50) an hour \u2013 double the federal minimum. Here, the minimum has been raised by 28% for workers in London and 18% for those in the rest of the UK.\n\nForget the idea that this is an act of philanthropy from Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. To be sure, it could be said that a company boasting record profits can afford to pay its workers a decent wage \u2013 particularly when large numbers of them in the US can only make ends meet on government food stamps \u2013 but that is not the way businesses are run.\n\nJeff Bezos\n\nNor does the move have anything to do with Philip Hammond\u2019s threat to impose a unilateral digital sales tax on companies such as Amazon in the absence of a global deal to force them to pay more. That, as Amazon well knows, is unlikely to happen.\n\nWhat\u2019s really happened is that Amazon has been squeezed from two directions at once. On the one hand, it has been taking serious stick from some high-profile enemies. In the US, this has included an unlikely alliance of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. In the UK, the company has come under fire from the GMB union and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon is struggling to fill vacancies as the labour market tightens. In Britain and the US, unemployment is about 4%, meaning workers \u2013 even deunionised workers \u2013 have more freedom to change job if they are unhappy. And, to say the least, Amazon is not a model employer.\n\nBezos put it this way: \u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead.\u201d That\u2019s not quite the full story. Certainly, it is smart of Amazon to move early so it can recruit and retain staff ahead of the busy Christmas period.\n\nBut the decision also disproves the idea that multinational companies are now so powerful they can do pretty much as they wish. Workers will be getting higher wages because of strong campaigning, skilful PR and the channelling of populist anger.\n\nA clash between Brussels and Rome was inevitable from the moment the Five Star Movement and the League formed a government in Italy in early June. It was only a question of time before populism in the shape of higher public spending and a rising budget deficit ran up against the EU\u2019s fiscal conservatism, and so it has proved.\n\nIn the past few days, Italy has published a budget that was bound to infuriate Brussels, because it involved more borrowing in each of the next three years and a widening of the structural deficit \u2013 the bit that is unaffected by the ups and downs of the economy. Rising to the bait, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that unless Italy backed down, it threatened the future of the single currency. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, has told Juncker to get lost.\n\nA man wearing a hat bearing the stars of the EU\nA pro-EU demonstrator at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. Photograph: Darren Staples\/Reuters\nThe EU has to be careful with Italy, which is not just the third biggest economy in the eurozone, but one with a fragile banking system. Matters are coming to a head just as negotiations between Britain and the EU enter a critical phase, but it would be a mistake to imagine the prospect of Italy becoming a new and bigger Greece would mean Theresa May will get an easier ride.\n\nFrom the outset, the EU has been determined to avoid any other country following Britain\u2019s example. That explains why its negotiator, Michel Barnier, has stuck firmly to his mandate.

{"text":"An outbreak of Ebola in Uganda is proving more difficult to deal with than more recent epidemics, with its recent spread to the capital city, Kampala, causing particular concern.\n\nSo far 75 cases have been confirmed in four provinces, though it is feared that there could be many more which were not detected before the victims were buried.\n\nWhat is Ebola?\nIt is a deadly virus with initial symptoms which can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat.\n\nSubsequent stages can include vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding, known as haemorrhaging.\n\n\nThe incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Symptoms of Ebola can sometimes be confused with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.\n\nWhy is this outbreak so serious?\nThe virus has been circulating in rural parts of Uganda since September but an outbreak in an urban area - like Kampala - is much more complex to deal with.\n\nThe population density and ease of mobility, including internationally, means the virus can easily travel through an infected but asymptomatic patient within a short period of time.\n\nHowever an asymptomatic person cannot transmit the virus. Speed is of the essence when tracing contacts of known cases, isolating and monitoring them for at least the 21-day incubation period of the virus.\n\nThe cooperation of such contacts with response teams is also crucial. The infection in Kampala has been traced to a contact of a confirmed case who reportedly travelled to the capital under a disguised identity.\n\nHe tried to seek help from a traditional healer before turning to a hospital where he was admitted, but later succumbed to the illness.\n\nSeven members of one family he had come into contact with got infected.\n\nEbola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated items or environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.\n\nThe Health Ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where the bodies were buried before they could be tested.\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the numbers of deaths given by Uganda's government and WHO figures, because the latter is counting the 18 probable Ebola deaths, whereas Kampala is only including deaths where Ebola has been confirmed.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.\n\nIs there a vaccine?\nAnother concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain.\n\nThe Health Ministry has said three candidate vaccines from Oxford, Sabin and Merck will be trialled for efficacy \"in coming weeks\". Several treatment options are also being tested, said Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng.\n\n\nEbola vaccines developed in the last few years have not been tested on the Sudan strain\nThe Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.\n\nWith more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.\n\nTwo years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.\n\nA second vaccine by Johnson & Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nBut neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.\n\nNonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni had previously said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.\n\nHow is Uganda dealing with the outbreak?\nThe focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.\n\nTreatment and isolation facilities have been set up in the affected districts. Their capacity is being ramped up as the virus spreads.\n\nMobile laboratories were also deployed, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.\n\nMedics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for stricter measures including more lockdowns of areas with confirmed cases.\n\nPresident Museveni initially ruled out such restrictions, saying: \"Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]\" as it is not an airborne disease.\n\nHe said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact.\n\nThe government later relented and placed the two districts at the centre of the outbreak under lockdown.\n\n\"We believe transmission may have been disrupted,\" said the Health Ministry as there had been no secondary cases of infection since the lockdown. However, no such restrictions have been imposed in Kampala.\n\nHow does Ebola spread?\nEbola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.\n\nBushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.\n\nIt then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.\n\nMen who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery.\n\nWhat precautions can be taken?\nTo prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.\n\nIt is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\nQuarantines have been ruled out\nIn eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected.\n\nHowever, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection.\n\nBodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial.\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Somewhere in the South Atlantic ocean right now, a 34,000-ton, 870-ft. aircraft carrier is floating aimlessly on the waves. The vessel, caught in an international dispute over its toxic contents, is about to become one of the biggest pieces of trash in the ocean.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo, the only aircraft carrier in the Brazilian navy\u2019s fleet, has been stuck in limbo for five months. Brazil sold the 60-year-old vessel for scrap to a Turkish shipyard in 2021, and in August 2022, it set off for Turkey from a naval base in Rio de Janeiro. But while it was on the move, Turkey rescinded its permission to enter, saying Brazil hadn\u2019t been able to prove that the S\u00e3o Paulo was free of asbestos\u2014a toxic mineral used in the construction of many 20th century ships. So, the boat turned around.\n\nBrazil doesn\u2019t want it back, though. In September, a port on the coast of Pernambuco state blocked the ship from docking. The port argued there was too big a risk that the ship would be abandoned, leaving port authorities to pick up the tab for moving it and dealing with the asbestos. That left the S\u00e3o Paulo circling off the Brazilian coast, until Jan. 20, when Brazil\u2019s navy announced that it had pushed the ship out to international waters, where it remains. The navy says it had to do so because the aging ship, which incurred damage to its hull during its odyssey, could have run aground or sank on the Brazilian coast, threatening other boats and coastal wildlife.\n\nThe navy\u2019s solution is to abandon the S\u00e3o Paulo at sea. On Saturday, military sources told Brazil\u2019s Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper that the navy planned to use explosive to sink the vessel on Wednesday, seeing it as the only way to put an end to its controversial saga.\n\nBut on Tuesday night, responding to concerns from a federal environmental agency, Brazil\u2019s public prosecutor filed a civil case against the navy, asking a federal court to order an immediate halt to any plans to detonate the ship.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision will determine whether or not the S\u00e3o Paulo becomes an extreme case of vessel abandonment\u2014a problem that plagues marine conservationists and coastal communities around the world. Ocean watchdogs say sinking a boat as big and old as the S\u00e3o Paulo would be an environmental disaster; as well as the asbestos, the ship contains hundreds of metric tons of other toxic substances in its electrical wiring, paints, and fuel stores, according to the Basel Action Network (BAN), an NGO.\n\nAbandoning it at sea would constitute \u201cgross negligence\u201d and violate three separate international environmental conventions, says Jim Puckett, BAN\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a ship containing both hazardous materials and valuable materials\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be brought into the territory of Brazil and managed in an environmentally sound way,\u201d Puckett says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sink it.\u201d\n\nApproached for comment, the Brazilian navy directed TIME to its official announcements, which say only that the navy will not allow the S\u00e3o Paulo to return to Brazil.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for boats to be abandoned. Because they are expensive to maintain and to dispose of properly, tens of thousands of unwanted vessels\u2014normally much smaller than an aircraft carrier\u2014are left in harbors, on beaches, or at sea every year. In Nigeria, thousands of wrecked cargo ships and commercial fishing vessels litter the coast, destroying beach ecosystems and making waterways dangerous to pass for local communities. In Venice, around 2,000 abandoned small recreational boats are clogging up a local wetland. In the U.S., the Government Accountability Office estimates that from 2013 to 2016, there were 5,600 boats abandoned in U.S. waters\u2014likely a very lowball estimate, according to Nancy Wallace, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s marine debris program.\n\n\nThe problem is, what\u2019s left onboard those boats doesn\u2019t stay onboard. \u201cAnytime there\u2019s a vessel that\u2019s left at sea, the first thing to think about is toxic chemicals, which can be very impactful to wildlife,\u201d Wallace says. Abandoned boats of any size can cause oil spills and leach paint chemicals and microplastics into the water, while debris such as nets can come loose, trapping fish.\n\nOlder vessels can also contain so-called PCBs, a group of highly carcinogenic chemicals that were often used in electrical wiring before the 1970s and were globally banned under the 2001 Stockholm convention. When dumped in the ocean, scientists say PCBs work their way up the marine food chain, affecting everything from small crustaceans to orcas. BAN estimates that the S\u00e3o Paulo, which was built in France in the 1960s, contains around 300 metric tons of PCBs, based on analysis of its sister ship, the Clemencau. The NGO says leaving the vessel at sea would violate both the Stockholm convention and the 1996 London Protocol.\n\nIn Brazil, the face of the ship abandonment problem is Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro state, where some 200 vessels, including cargo ships and oil tankers, have been left to rot by owners caught up in financial or legal troubles. Local NGOs say the resulting oil and chemical pollution has dramatically reduced native mangrove, tortoise, and dolphin populations, and has hurt the livelihoods of local fishermen. The bay made national headlines in November, when a storm caused a 660-ft. cargo ship to come loose from its moorings and crash into the Rio-Niteroi\u2014Latin America\u2019s longest over-water bridge.\n\nRemains of abandoned ships are seen on the shores of the Guanabara Bay in Niteroi, Brazil, on Dec. 28, 2022. (Pilar Olivares\u2014Reuters)\n\nRemoving such vessels is a major headache for governments. Hauling them out can cost anywhere from $8,000 (the per-boat cost for 14 recreational boats recently lifted out of the water in South Carolina) to $1.8 million (the cost for removing an 83-ft. fishing boat in Saipan in 2021, which had been degrading a nearby coral reef in the Northern Mariana Islands for six years after a 2015 storm left it too damaged for its owners to repair.)\n\n\nBut, thankfully, it is highly unusual for a ship as large as the S\u00e3o Paulo to be deliberately abandoned. That\u2019s because large boats like cruise ships, container ships, and aircraft carriers contain vast amounts of high-quality valuable metals, especially steel, which can be salvaged and resold. (Recycling is also beneficial for the environment, since manufacturing new steel is extremely carbon-intensive.)\n\nPuckett, from BAN, says the idea of sinking the S\u00e3o Paulo doesn\u2019t make financial sense for Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s got millions of dollars worth of steel to be recycled, which far outweighs the cost of managing those hazardous materials,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a valuable ship being deliberately sunk.\u201d\n\nBAN is calling on Brazil\u2019s new leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to step in. To comply with international treaties, including the Basel Convention restricting the export of toxic waste, Puckett says the navy must tow the S\u00e3o Paulo into a naval base, repair the damage to the hull, and then offer the recycling contract to new shipyards in Europe, which can safely remove the asbestos before dismantling the ship.\n\nThe case brought by Brazil\u2019s public prosecutor\u2019s office opens a last minute door to that happening. It asks the court to compel the navy to carry out a technical assessment of all the options for disposing of the ship, and find a way of doing so \u201c\u201dwithout risk to the environment and public health.\u201d That might just save the S\u00e3o Paulo from a toxic watery grave.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Dive Brief\nU.S. egg production numbers are on the rise, signaling a rebuild after bird flu decimated commercial flocks last year and sent prices skyrocketing.\nA total of 9.37 billion eggs were produced in May, up 4% from last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Egg production levels were down as much as 6% earlier this year, but started to show signs of improvement in April.\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, a contagious disease often fatal to birds, has affected 325 U.S. commercial poultry flocks over the past year, but only seven cases have been reported since March. No cases were reported in the past 30 days.\nDive Insight\n\nHPAI, often spread by migratory birds, affected more than 58 million commercial and wild birds in the past year, the country\u2019s worst outbreak on record, according to USDA data. As cases spread, supplies tightened and prices soared, especially for eggs.\n\nU.S. egg inventories were down 29% in December compared to the start of 2022. More than 43 million egg-laying hens died from disease or depopulation efforts last year. Wholesale egg prices surged 267% on increased holiday demand. They have since decreased as flocks are rebuilt and farmers adopt biosecurity measures as HPAI preventative.\n\n\n SUPPLY CHAIN DIVE: PROCUREMENT\n\nAfter last year\u2019s outbreak, Brian Earnest, lead economist, animal protein at CoBank, said he anticipated HPAI to be a year-round issue in 2023 with a lingering expectation that it would be back in full force, but \u201cthat does not seem to be the case.\u201d\n\nInstead, the rate of infection among domestic commercial poultry flocks has significantly weakened, according to USDA data.

{"text":"As a historic drought continues to tighten the vise on the number and size of freight ships passing through the Panama Canal, many vessels are seeing increased dwell time and lead time to deliver their loads, the freight visibility provider project44 said Tuesday.\n\nWithout enough fresh water to operate its locks at standard pace, the canal recently added another 10 months to \u201cCondition 3\u201d restrictions that have squeezed capacity from 36 vessels per day transiting the canal to 32, and limited their draft underwater from the usual allowance of 50 feet to 44 feet.\n\nThose limits are causing notable backups. As of August 29, a total of 135 vessels were waiting for passage at both the Atlantic and Pacific entrances, significantly above the canal\u2019s goal to keep queues below 90 vessels, the canal said.\n\nHowever, despite those kinks, canal authorities say they have not seen a measurable reduction in the amount of cargo passing through the route. Just as it was in 2022, the canal remains the primary route for 57.5% of the total cargo transported in container ships from Asia to the eastern coast of the U.S., the canal says.\n\nOne reason that the delays haven\u2019t yet diverted ocean freight to other routes is that the effects aren't uniform across all carriers, Chicago-based project44 said. The canal typically gives priority to container ships over bulk carriers, and serves ships with appointments before those without. \n\nThe difference can be stark. Of the 135 vessels waiting in line, 53 have made reservations and will transit the Panama Canal without delay on their scheduled date. But the wait time for vessels lacking a booking appointment to pass through the canal has increased by 280% since June, going from an average of 2.5 days to approximately 9.5 days.\n\nThat means the best way to maintain smooth transits through the canal is to maintain effective communication between carriers and the port. \u201cShippers who proactively schedule appointments and maintain robust communication channels with the canal experience significantly fewer disruptions compared to those who infrequently use this route. The vessels that are most impacted by the new restrictions are non-booked, so shippers should be proactively booking vessels planned to pass through the canal,\u201d project44 said.\n\nBut as the \u201cCondition 3\u201d restrictions wear on, the penalty for lacking that communication could be increasingly severe. Many ships may begin to look for alternate shipping routes or lighten their loads to carry less weight and comply with draft limits, according to David Spencer, VP of Market Intelligence at Arrive Logistics. And those steps could have ripple effects throughout U.S. markets.\n\n\u201cIn general, ocean shipping delays tend to cause more of a funnel effect on import volumes, essentially throttling associated demand. Equipment shortages were a major headache as a side effect of COVID-19 related delays, which created a lot of interesting trends with cross docking, warehousing, and drayage. We would probably see some of those trends return as well as a result,\u201d Spencer said.","labels":["natural_disasters"]}
{"text":"New York\nCNN\n \u2014 \nBoeing reported a $650 million operating loss in the fourth quarter, surprising Wall Street analysts who had expected the aircraft giant to turn a profit.\n\nThe company blamed the unexpected loss on \u201cabnormal production costs\u201d as it tried both to deliver the remaining backlog of 737 Max jets and to step up deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners. The company\u2019s production of the 787 remains below normal rates.\n\n\u201cWe continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines \u2026 as we run into supply chain shortfalls,\u201d CEO Dave Calhoun told investors Wednesday. \u201cSo those stoppages, while they are coming down, are not where they need to be.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Boeing had to shell out an unspecified amount of compensation to 787 customers whose deliveries were delayed by about a year.\n\nThe company also warned Wednesday that it will post a loss in the current quarter, although it did not give a range. That\u2019s a disappointment, as analysts have been forecasting the Boeing would report a narrow profit for the quarter.\n\nShares of Boeing (BA) were down more than 3% in late morning trading after that guidance.\n\nBoeing has reported only two profitable quarters in the nearly four years since the grounding of the 737 Max. After two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, the jet was grounded for 20 months starting in March 2019. Then a year later, the pandemic brought demand for flying and new aircraft to a near halt \u2014 sparking the cancellation of hundreds of jet orders and the pileup of losses for Boeing.\n\nStill, the industry has shown signs of picking up, and analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast that Boeing would earn 26 cents a share. Instead it reported a loss of $1.75 a share. So while that\u2019s an improvement from the loss of $7.69 a share in the fourth quarter of of 2021, it\u2019s also another big disappointment.\n\nA difficult few years\nBoeing\u2019s problems in the fourth quarter are tied to its difficult few years since the 737 Max crisis.\n\nFor one, the company was saddled with excess inventory of hundreds of the jets. Usually Boeing doesn\u2019t hold onto inventory, as planes are delivered to customers soon after completion.\n\nBut even though the 737 Max jets couldn\u2019t be delivered during the grounding, Boeing kept building them \u2014 partly to keep its suppliers in business. Then it was forced to find new buyers for some of those planes due to customers canceling orders during the pandemic.\n\nBeyond the Max, the FAA flagged quality problems with the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliners that stopped it from delivering that model. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still affected the company: Much of Boeing\u2019s abnormal production costs last quarter were a result of having to rework both the Max and Dreamliner jets, CEO Dave Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday.\n\nThe supply chain problems are improving, Calhoun added, but they are not behind the company or the aerospace industry as a whole, He suggested more money-losing quarters may be ahead despite a rebound in demand, saying he expects Boeing to have \u201cbouncy\u201d margins throughout the year as its Max and Dreamliner inventories are cleared.\n\nBoeing delivered 152 commercial jets in the quarter, up 54% from a year ago and better than its own target.\n\nBut digging deeper into the financial results highlights a potential problem: It appears Boeing received lower prices on some of its planes than analysts had expected.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company\u2019s revenue fell short of forecasts, coming in at just below $20 billion. While it was Boeing\u2019s highest revenue figure since the start of the pandemic, it was about $360 million less than analysts\u2019 consensus estimate. The combination of better-than-expected deliveries but worse-than-forecast revenue suggests that weaker pricing.\n\n\u2018Focused on driving stability\u2019\nBoeing tried to put the best spin possible on its disappointing results.\n\nThe company pointed out that this was the first full year of positive operating cash flow since the start of the 737 Max crisis. Boeing finally brought in $3.5 billion more cash than it spent, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 of positive operating cash flow of between $4.5 bililon to $6.5 billion.\n\n\u201cDemand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond,\u201d said Calhoun in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWhile challenges remain, we are well positioned and are on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress","supplychain"]}

It has a foothold across the globe and is now reaching countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis because of conflict, natural disasters and climate change.\n\nThe response plan will be implemented by UN agencies, with international NGOs and NGO consortia playing a direct role in the response. It will:\n\ndeliver essential laboratory equipment to test for the virus, and medical supplies to treat people;\ninstall handwashing stations in camps and settlements;\nlaunch public information campaigns on how to protect yourself and others from the virus; and\nestablish airbridges and hubs across Africa, Asia and Latin America to move humanitarian workers and supplies to where they are needed most.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said:\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is menacing the whole of humanity \u2013 and so the whole of humanity must fight back. Individual country responses are not going to be enough.\n\n\u201cWe must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable \u2013 millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves.  This is a matter of basic human solidarity. It is also crucial for combating the virus. This is the moment to step up for the vulnerable.\u201d\n\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said:\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has already upended life in some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries. It is now reaching places where people live in warzones, cannot easily access clean water and soap, and have no hope of a hospital bed if they fall critically ill.\n\n\u201cTo leave the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries to their fate would be both cruel and unwise. If we leave coronavirus to spread freely in these places, we would be placing millions at high risk, whole regions will be tipped into chaos and the virus will have the opportunity to circle back around the globe.  \n\n\u201cCountries battling the pandemic at home are rightly prioritizing people living in their own communities. But the hard truth is they will be failing to protect their own people if they do not act now to help the poorest countries protect themselves.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to help these countries prepare and continue helping the millions who rely on humanitarian assistance from the UN to survive. Properly funded, our global response effort will equip humanitarian organizations with the tools to fight the virus, save lives, and help contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.\u201d\n\nWHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:\n\n\u201cThe virus is now spreading in countries with weak health systems, including some which are already facing humanitarian crises. These countries need our support \u2013 out of solidarity but also to protect us all and help suppress this pandemic. At the same time, we must not fight the pandemic at the expense of the other humanitarian health emergencies.\u201d \n\nUNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said:\n\n\u201cChildren are the hidden victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and school closures are affecting their education, mental health and access to basic health services. The risks of exploitation and abuse are higher than ever, for boys and girls alike. For children on the move or living through conflicts, the consequences will be unlike any we have ever seen. We must not let them down.\u201d\n\nAt the virtual launch of the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, the UN Secretary-General was joined via video link by Mr. Lowcock, Dr Tedros and Ms. Fore.\n\nTogether they called on UN Member States to commit to stemming the impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable countries and containing the virus globally by giving the strongest possible support to the plan, while also sustaining core support to existing humanitarian appeals that help the more than 100 million people who already rely on humanitarian assistance from the UN just to survive.\n\nMember States were warned that any diversion of funding from existing humanitarian operations would create an environment in which cholera, measles and meningitis can thrive, in which even more children become malnourished, and in which extremists can take control \u2013 an environment that would be the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus.  \n\nTo kick-start the response plan, Mr. Lowcock released an additional $60 million from the UN\u2019s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). This brings CERF\u2019s support to humanitarian action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to $75 million. In addition, country-based pooled funds have allocated more than $3 million so far.\n\nThis new CERF allocation \u2013 one of the largest ever made \u2013 will support: WFP to ensure the continuity of supply chains and transport of aid workers and relief goods; WHO to contain the spread of the pandemic; and other agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to those most affected by the pandemic, including women and girls, refugees and internally displaced people. Support will include efforts around food security, physical and mental health, water and sanitation, nutrition and protection.\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Dec 16 (Reuters) - Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) has finalized a $698 million settlement with the U.S. state of Oregon to resolve claims that it polluted the environment with chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, the German pharmaceutical company and the state said Thursday.\n\nThe deal, first disclosed in August, follows similar agreements with five other states and the District of Columbia, and with a nationwide class of municipal entities. Bayer still faces several other state lawsuits over PCBs.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it did not admit liability as part of the Oregon settlement, and would continued to defend the remaining cases.\n\nOregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum called the settlement a \"huge win\" that would give the state resources to clean up PCBs.\n\nThe lawsuits against Bayer stem from PCBs manufactured by U.S. seeds and pesticide company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018.

{"text":"The pharmaceutical giant wouldn't be borrowing if it didn't have plans for how to make a tidy return.\nOn May 16, Pfizer (PFE -0.46%) announced that it was going to take out $31 billion in fresh debt to pay for its purchase of Seagen (SGEN 0.51%), an oncology drug developer. In total, it'll pay $43 billion for the company in a transaction that's set to reshape its future, and power shareholder returns for the remainder of the 2020s and perhaps beyond.\n\nSomewhat counterintuitively, investors should interpret this debt issuance as good news for Pfizer's stock. Here's why.\n\nTwo investors talk at a desk while drinking coffee and reviewing a stock chart on a laptop.\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\n\nThe benefits to Pfizer could be huge\nThe point of buying Seagen is that the company's 31 drugs in development could yield as much as $10 billion in annual revenue for Pfizer by 2030. They'll nearly double the size of Pfizer's oncology portfolio, which could position the company to be a global leader in cancer therapeutics for years to come. And when the transaction closes in late 2023 or early 2024, Seagen will also contribute its top line of approximately $2 billion to Pfizer's, though it isn't making a profit.\n\n\nCollapse\n\nNYSE: PFE\nPfizer\nToday's Change\n(-0.46%) -$0.17\nCurrent Price\n$36.84\nYTD\n1W\n1M\n3M\n6M\n1Y\n5Y\nPRICE\nVS S&P\n PFE\n S&P\nKEY DATA POINTS\nMarket Cap\n$208B\nDay's Range\n$36.55 - $37.15\n52wk Range\n$34.66 - $54.93\nVolume\n18,536,903\nAvg Vol\n26,049,092\nGross Margin\n63.40%\nDividend Yield\n4.43%\nGrabbing Seagen is one of the pillars of management's plan to add $45 billion in fresh annual revenue before the end of the decade, to reach a total of around $84 billion annually. It will help offset the anticipated loss of around $17 billion in sales from expiring exclusivity licenses for its medicines, and stem some of the losses from its rapidly eroding coronavirus drugs.\n\nTaking out more debt does involve paying some interest expenses, and it won't push the company to top 2022's more than $100 billion in sales anytime soon. But it's also a sign that management is willing to make big and bold bets for the sake of stoking growth.\n\n\nDon't worry about this company running up the tab\nWhile the potential advantages of the purchase are likely to be significant, Pfizer shareholders are correct to question the wisdom of taking out gargantuan tranches of new debt. After all, there's always a risk that Seagen's much-vaunted pipeline fails to yield enough new medicines to justify the costs of the investment and interest fees. But a closer inspection of Pfizer's balance sheet and cash flow statement can put these concerns to rest.\n\n\nCollapse\n\nNASDAQ: SGEN\nSeagen\nToday's Change\n(0.51%) $0.98\nCurrent Price\n$194.28\nYTD\n1W\n1M\n3M\n6M\n1Y\n5Y\nPRICE\nVS S&P\n SGEN\n S&P\nKEY DATA POINTS\nMarket Cap\n$36B\nDay's Range\n$193.25 - $194.75\n52wk Range\n$116.08 - $207.16\nVolume\n1,148,861\nAvg Vol\n1,049,754\nGross Margin\n76.46%\nDividend Yield\nN\/A\nRight now, Pfizer has about $20 billion in cash and equivalents, so it won't be using all of its liquid assets for the acquisition. As of the first quarter of 2023, it has $34.9 billion in long-term debt, so it'll have a total of roughly $65.9 billion after issuing the new debt.\n\nThat might sound like a scary amount until you consider that in 2022 free cash flow (FCF) was just over $26 billion. In 2019, even before Pfizer's massive windfall from sales of coronavirus products, it had FCF of nearly $10 billion. So as vaccine sales continue to erode due to falling demand, the company will still have plenty of money to service its debt.\n\nShareholders won't need to wait that long to see if the purchase is yielding fruit. Company leaders expect that between three and four years after the deal closes, the acquisition will start contributing to adjusted earnings per share (EPS). After paying down some of the debt it plans to rack up, Pfizer will focus on both reinvesting earnings into further growth and returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases. And management probably wouldn't bother to talk about a shift toward returning more capital if its plan was to slowly pay down the debt over the course of many years.\n\nShould you buy the stock?\nThe debt isn't a sign that Pfizer's stock is a smart investment for you specifically, even if it's good news for the company's future. The same goes for the Seagen purchase. In the near term, it's highly likely that declining need for Pfizer's coronavirus products will continue to be a headwind. You probably shouldn't expect this stock to grow as quickly as a smaller biopharma business.\n\nStill, if you're in the market for a safe-but-still-slated-to-grow company that pays a decent dividend -- currently yielding 4.5% -- it could be a good option. Just remember that you'll probably need to wait a few years before there's enough spare cash flow for Pfizer to start hiking its dividend faster, or buying shares back in larger volumes.","labels":["financial_success","investments"]}

{"text":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every economic sector and the shipping and trucking industries are no exception. Like a domino effect, the decline in manufacturing in other countries has reduced international trade leading to a loss of work at American ports and roads.  \n\nCargo volumes were stored at major ports but not transported; bans on international imports and exports have led to lack of productivity at these ports, leading to a loss of jobs for truck drivers, and most retailers had cancelled orders before the start of the summer. No industry around the world\u2013automotive,  pharmaceuticals, domestic goods or consumer goods\u2013was spared. \n\nImpact on American Ports:\n\nThe coronavirus hit the country\u2019s shipping ports hard, with many facing steep reductions in cargo trade compared to last year. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 COVID-19 Infrastructure Report, the economic downturn stands to cause significant damage to ports\u2019 overall volumes, to the tune of an estimated decline of 20% to 30% in total annual receipts. \n\nThe Port of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s largest port, moved 856,389 Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) in July, a 6.11% decrease. As of the end of July, overall cargo volumes had decreased 15.3%. \n\nThe Port of Long Beach actually saw an increase in cargo shipments, bucking the declining trend faced by other ports in the country. The nation\u2019s second-busiest port moved 21.1% more cargo in July 2020 compared with July 2019. Two potential causes come to mind: a lag in orders placed in 2018 may have filled inventories and shifted additional orders from 2019 to 2020, resulting in a year-over-year increase in cargo volume numbers, independent of the pandemic. Also, the Executive Director of Los Angeles Port shared in a statement that there had been a shift of some services from the Port of LA to Long Beach in June, which could have caused an additional gain for the latter and loss for the former during these months.\n\nThe Port of New York and New Jersey saw a 16.3% year-over-year decrease in total Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) in June. Imports decreased by 12.5% and exports decreased by 20.3%, while the total number of empty containers decreased by 16.3%. \n\nWhy Were the Numbers Down?\n\nThis decline can be attributed to several factors: manufacturing in countries in Asia and Europe affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; reduced demand, especially consumer demand, in the U.S. during the ongoing crisis; and the virtual standstill of manufacturing in the US  for the first few months of 2020 leading to retailers delaying, postponing or in many cases, even canceling shipping orders.\n\nLastly, most of these ports experienced record-high volume trends last year, so some of the 2020 decrease reflects reversion to the mean. \n\nImpact on the Trucking Industry:\n\nAs usual, when any mobility mode is affected, the effect reverberates throughout all modes of transportation. Trucking companies are the most used \u2018way-of-means\u2019 to move freight from port, and gate movement is seen as a reliable way of tracking truck movement in ports. Increases in gate movement show that a port is running \u2018healthy\u2019 since more trucks are required to move a surge in cargo volume (the reverse also holds true). Gate Movement Analysis data from the Port of Los Angeles show that the port activity had almost been restored to pre-pandemic levels in the months of July and August. \n\nTotal container moves in 2020 fell 6% year-over-year each month until April 2020. This deficit was reduced to 2.75% by July, demonstrating a definite uptick in summer shipping orders. \n\nTrucking Industry Status in the Tristate Area:\n\nWhen providing data sources, Lisa Yakomin, the President of the Association of Bi-State Motor Carriers (based in the Tristate area), told me that the cargo trade at PA-NY&NJ is more diversified (as compared with the ports on the West Coast like the Port of Los Angeles) with regards to the container origin, which muted the initial impact of the slowdown. \u201cThe pandemic started exploding here in NY\/NJ right on the heels of the Chinese New Year, a time when things are typically slow anyway, so that\u2019s another reason we didn\u2019t feel the effects right away.\u201d\n\nWeigh-in-motion (WIM) data from the C2SMART\u2019s testbed on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) supports Ms. Yakomin\u2019s statement. In the Center\u2019s first edition of the COVID-19 and Transportation White Paper series, C2SMART researchers showed that truck traffic had appeared to have dropped 15% on the Queens-bound route and 19% on the Staten Island-bound (SIB) route compared to pre-pandemic numbers. With fewer cars on the road and little to no traffic in March and April, the average speed range on this section of the BQE increased by approximately 5mph for both QB and SIB, a point reiterated by Ms. Yakomin as well.\n\nThis post comes from Siva Sooryaa Muruga Thambiran, an undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Civil Engineering from NYU Tandon.\n\nFigure 1: FTR\u2019s Truck Freight Recovery Index shows the impact of the pandemic on the industry in different phases (from FleetMagazineMag.com)\n\nTable 1: Comparison of cargo volume (in TEUs) for different ports in the US for the first seven months (NOTE: Numbers for PA-NY & NJ are only until June 2020)\n\nFigure 2: The Port of New York and New Jersey Freight Movement Statistics for the month of June 2020 (From PANYNJ.Gov)\n\nFigure 3: Trucking Activity at the Port of Los Angeles (from PortofLosAngeles.org)\n\nTable 2: Summary of Average WIM Data During 4 Periods; (A) Jan 1-Mar 1, 2020, (B) Mar 1- Mar 22, (C) Mar 22- May 3, (D) May 4-June 28 (E) June 29-August 15 (% percentage denotes the changes between two periods) (Data taken from the C2SMART Urban Roadway Testbed Project)\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Weekly Change in Number of Trucks (Weekday Only; Weekend Excluded) (Data taken from the C2SMART Urban Roadway Testbed Project)\nLooking at the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) numbers for the first two months of this year: for QB the number is 5927 while for SIB, it is 5495 while for the first two of weeks of March, the corresponding AADT numbers reduced by 7.8% and 4.8%. From the week of 3\/23 (until 05\/04), the AADT figures represent a -24.5% and -46.7% decline in numbers. From the week of 05\/04 until the last week of June, the AADT numbers were up by 34.9% for QB and 38.7% for SIB, while the corresponding numbers in the next time period until August 10 were 1.2% and 0.55%; indicating a possible uptick in shipping orders as the state economy slowly reopened.\n\nLooking at the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) numbers for the first two months of this year: for QB the number is 5927 while for SIB, it is 5495 while for the first two of weeks of March, the corresponding AADT numbers for QB and SIB are 5458 and 5233 respectively showing a delayed  or reduced effect. From the week of 3\/23 (until 05\/04), the AADT for QB and SIB are 4119 and 3568, representing a -24.5% and -31.8% decline in numbers. From the week of 05\/04 until the last week of June, the AADT numbers were up to 5559 for QB and 4949 for SIB, while the corresponding numbers in the next time period until August 10 were 5626 and 4976; indicating a possible uptick in shipping orders as the state economy slowly reopened.\n\nData presented covers FHWA Class 9 through Class 13 of 5 or more axles. \n\nAs seen in Figure 4, freight volumes at PA-NY&NJ dropped off considerably in late March and April, before slowly picking up in May. Most retail stores and other small businesses were closed, many customers cancelled their summer orders, vessel sailings were cancelled, and freight volume dropped precipitously. This had a corresponding effect on truck movement as well.\n\nThe Future\n\nLooking ahead, it will be interesting to see if shipments during the holiday season will be drastically affected. Usually, orders are placed starting from June, but with this year, all timeline scenarios have been thrown off due to the pandemic. While it was expected that a second wave of hospitalizations due to the pandemic would have had an impact on the shipping industry, so far there has not been a drastic change. \n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

Bates for The New York Times\n\nThe notion that the rapid increase in interest rates could threaten financial stability is hardly new. In recent months, economists have remarked often that it is surprising that the Fed has been able to raise rates so much, so fast without severe disruptions to a marketplace that has grown used to rock-bottom borrowing costs.\n\nWhat was less expected is where the first crack showed: small and midsize U.S. banks, in theory among the most closely monitored and tightly regulated pieces of the global financial system.\n\nInflation F.A.Q.\nWhat is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.\n\nWhat causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.\n\nIs inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.\n\nHow does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.\n\nCan inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\u201cI was surprised where the problem came, but I wasn\u2019t surprised there was a problem,\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and leading scholar of financial crises, said in an interview. In an essay in early January, he warned of the risk of a \u201clooming financial contagion\u201d as governments and businesses struggled to adjust to an era of higher interest rates.\n\nHe said he did not expect a repeat of 2008, when the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market quickly engulfed virtually the entire global financial system. Banks around the world are better capitalized and better regulated than they were back then, and the economy itself is stronger.\n\n\u201cUsually to have a more systemic financial crisis, you need more than one shoe to drop,\u201d Professor Rogoff said. \u201cThink of higher real interest rates as one shoe, but you need another.\u201d\n\nStill, he and other experts said it was alarming that such severe problems could go undetected so long at Silicon Valley Bank, the midsize California institution whose failure set in motion the latest turmoil. That raises questions about what other threats could be lurking, perhaps in less regulated corners of finance such as real estate or private equity.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not on top of that, then what about some of these other, more shadowy parts of the financial system?\u201d said Anil Kashyap, a University of Chicago economist who studies financial crises.\n\nAlready, there are hints that the crisis may not be limited to the United States. Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank after investors dumped its stock as fears arose about its financial health. The 166-year-old lender has faced a long series of scandals and missteps, and its problems aren\u2019t directly related to those of Silicon Valley Bank and other U.S. institutions. But economists said the violent market reaction was a sign that investors were growing concerned about the stability of the broader system.\n\nThe turmoil in the financial world comes just as the economic recovery, at least in the United States, seemed to be gaining momentum. Consumer spending, which fell in late 2022, rebounded early this year. The housing market, which slumped in 2022 as mortgage rates rose, had shown signs of stabilizing. And despite high-profile layoffs at large tech companies, job growth has stayed strong or even accelerated in recent months. By early March, forecasters were raising their estimates of economic growth and marking down the risks of a recession, at least this year.\n\n\u200cNow, many of them are reversing course. Mr. Bryson, of Wells Fargo, said he now put the probability of a recession this year at about 65 percent, up from about 55 percent before the recent bank failures. Even Goldman Sachs, among the most optimistic forecasters on Wall Street in recent months, said Thursday that the chances of a recession had risen \u200c10 percentage points, to 35 percent, as a result of the crisis and the resulting uncertainty.\n\nThe most immediate impact is likely to be on lending. Small and midsize banks could tighten their lending standards and issue fewer loans, either in a voluntary effort to shore up their finances or in response to heightened scrutiny from regulators. That could be a blow to residential and commercial developers, manufacturers and other businesses that rely on debt to finance their day-to-day operations.\n\nJanet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday that the federal government was \u201cmonitoring very carefully\u201d the health of the banking system and of credit conditions more broadly.\n\n\u201cA more general problem that concerns us is the possibility that if banks are under stress, they might be reluctant to lend,\u201d she told members of the Senate Finance Committee. That, she added, \u201ccould turn this into a source of significant downside economic risk.\u201d\n\nTighter credit is likely to be a particular challenge for small businesses, which typically don\u2019t have ready access to other sources of financing, such as the corporate debt market, and which often rely on relationships with bankers who know their specific industry or local community. Some may be able to get loans from big banks, which have so far seemed largely immune from the problems facing smaller institutions. But they will almost certainly pay more to do so, and many businesses may not be able to obtain credit at all, forcing them to cut back on hiring, investing and spending.\n\nImage\nA three-story multifamily building under construction, with excavation equipment in front.\nThe housing market, which slumped in 2022 as mortgage rates rose, had shown signs of stabilizing before the banking crisis arose.Credit...Jennifer Pottheiser for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIt may be hard to replace those small and medium-size banks with other sources of capital,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan. \u201cThat, in turn, could hinder growth.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSlower growth, of course, is exactly what the Fed has been trying to achieve by raising interest rates \u2014 and tighter credit is one of the main channels through which monetary policy is believed to work. If businesses and consumers pull back activity, either because borrowing becomes more expensive or because they are nervous about the economy, that could, in theory, help the Fed bring inflation under control.\n\nBut Philipp Schnabl, a New York University economist who has studied the recent banking problems, said policymakers had been trying to rein in the economy by crimping demand for goods and services. A financial upheaval, by contrast, could result in a sudden loss of access to credit. That tighter bank lending could also affect overall supply in the economy, which is hard to address through Fed policy.\n\n\u201cWe have been raising rates to affect aggregate demand,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you get this credit crunch, but that\u2019s coming from financial stability concerns.\u201d\n\nStill, the U.S. economy retains sources of strength that could help cushion the latest blows. Households, in the aggregate, have ample savings and rising incomes. Businesses, after years of strong profits, have relatively little debt. And despite the struggles of their smaller peers, the biggest U.S. banks are on much firmer financial footing than they were in 2008.\n\n\u201cI still believe \u2014 not just hope \u2014 that the damage to the real economy from this is going to be pretty limited,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI can tell a very com","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Goldman Sachs just upped the ante on the remote work reckoning.\n\nThe company is asking workers to come back to the office five days a week, according to a Bloomberg report. This is a much stricter policy than many other corporations, who have asked employees to return for at least two to three days a week.\n\nAnd Goldman's move to raise the stakes on RTO could spur others to do the same.\n\n\"It's time to face reality. We're getting back to five days a week, because that's the reality. That's what we saw before COVID and that's what we're currently seeing,\" said Jason Greer, the founder and president of Greer Consulting, on CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\"Companies are coming from the perspective of this\u2026 If I pay you every two weeks to come into the office, you come into the office and if you don't like it, take your ball and go somewhere else because there are thousands of employees looking to get your position,\" Greer said.\n\nGreer said that companies are in a much different place than they were two years ago when they were offering employees more incentives, greater pay, and struggling to hire. There are more potential employees on the market, and quite simply, they have more leverage. So they are increasingly asking employees to come back to the office full time, even if it means they lose some workers.\n\n\"I hear this from executives all the time: 'We understand that we put these mandates in place, we're going to lose some people, but the good thing is there's so much available talent in the market, that if we lose those folks, we can replace them with people \u2014 and we can replace them with people who will actually command less than what those people were leaving out the door are commanding,'\" Greer said.\n\nGreer said that there were a lot of employers who paid workers $50,000 to $100,000 more than what they wanted to during the pandemic labor shortage. But now, with layoffs across industries, especially in tech, employers have more power. Many companies have also realized they can maintain productivity with fewer people.\n\nAmazon, Meta, and other major companies are also putting more pressure on employees to return to the office. Meta is asking most employees to return at least three days a week after September 5 or they could potentially lose their jobs.\n\nAmazon is asking remote employees to return to the company's nearest \"hub,\" which is a location assigned to them, or find work elsewhere. Even Zoom, the company that powered the remote work revolution during the COVID Era, is asking employees who work within 50 miles of its offices to return at least two days a week.\n\nGreer said that employers are asking people back because there are connections you simply cannot make in a remote environment where people are operating virtually.\n\n\"In order to build a culture, you need to be face-to-face,\" he said. \"Your manager needs to get to know you, you need to get to know your manager, you need to get to know your coworkers. And we can only do that to an extent virtually.\"\n\nIn short, the writing is on the wall.\n\n\"The days of COVID where we are able to work remotely, they're gone,\" Greer said.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"Top executives at Discover Financial Services are vowing to bolster its regulatory compliance framework, saying Thursday that the consumer lender \u2014 which is on the cusp of federal penalties \u2014 is suffering the consequences of years of underinvestment in risk management and compliance.\n\nThe firm's update to investors was highly anticipated after the surprise announcement Monday that CEO Roger Hochschild was resigning. \n\nInvestors appeared to give interim CEO John Owen a small vote of confidence, boosting Discover's stock price some 2.3% on Thursday amid hopes that the credit card company can avoid a worst-case regulatory scenario.\n\nBut analysts are still warning it may take quite a while for the Illinois-based company to remedy its growing headaches.\n\nDiscover has yet to hire a permanent replacement for Hochschild, a 25-year company veteran who had been CEO since 2018. A consent order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over consumer compliance issues is still pending, and executives who spoke on a call with analysts Thursday didn't rule out further regulatory actions.\n\nPlus, overhauling a company's compliance framework is never quick \u2014 or cheap.\n\n\"Obviously, the board did not have confidence in the CEO,\" said Kevin Barker, an analyst at Piper Sandler. \"So it's hard for shareholders and investors to get confidence in what is happening right now.\"\n\n\nThe $138 billion-asset company is about to undergo a \"reinvestment cycle,\" Barker said, potentially leading to permanent structural expenses that will weigh on its profitability going forward.\n\nOwen, a board member who stepped in as Discover's interim head, said the company has made significant progress over the last 18 months but has a \"fair amount of work to do.\"\n\nDiscover is focused on \"driving accountability and ensuring that we don't put profits before compliance excellence,\" said John Greene, the company's chief financial officer.\n\n\"I'm not saying that that was an overt choice that the company made historically,\" Greene said. \"But we do need to make sure that we invest enough to achieve compliance and risk management excellence.\"\n\nThe company \"historically underinvested\" in those areas, he said.\n\n\"And we're paying the price right now,\" Greene added. \"So we're going to make sure we don't underinvest going forward.\"\n\nThose investments won't come cheap. Greene said risk and compliance costs have risen by more than $300 million between 2019 and this year. Discover is eyeing spending of about $460 million on those issues in 2023. And while the company hasn't finalized its budget for 2024, Greene said that he \"wouldn't expect\" its risk and compliance costs to decrease.\n\nThe big concern among investors is that Discover will be stuck in a \"prolonged compliance quagmire,\" Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research, wrote in a research note.\n\nSome analysts were relatively optimistic about the company's compliance outlook.\n\nDon Fandetti, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote that the \"bear case\" of prolonged regulatory pain doesn't appear to be playing out.\n\n\"We wouldn't be surprised if the stock recovers some of the steep losses,\" Fandetti wrote in a research note. \n\nStill, Discover's stock price \"will have an overhang until we get FDIC clarity,\" Fandetti wrote. Discover's stock price has sunk roughly 24% since last month, when it disclosed the looming FDIC action \u2014 and also revealed that it overcharged merchants for 16 years.\n\nGreene, the company's CFO, said that an investigation into the overcharging of merchants \"is nearing an end.\" The FDIC consent order isn't final yet but will be public when the agency releases it, he noted.\n\nThe agency's order is focused on prior years, Greene added, saying that \"there could be other regulatory follow-ups\" from the FDIC or other regulatory agencies.\n\nOwen said he doesn't expect major changes in corporate strategy, and that Discover executives are \"going to execute with the plan we have.\" The company runs a payments network that looks to compete with Visa and Mastercard, and it also offers credit cards, student loans, personal loans and mortgages. Its online bank also has a growing deposit portfolio thanks to higher interest rates.\n\n\"For the most part, we're going to stay the course,\" Owen said. \n\nThe team will also largely look the same \u2014 now that Discover has brought on new leaders in key roles as it looks to improve its regulatory standing. The company has a new chief information officer, a new general counsel and a new chief compliance officer. \n\nOwen said the firm has a \"good balance\" of Discover veterans who understand the business and \"new talent that has dealt with the compliance issues at other companies.\"\n\nDiscover has also added a board member with significant industry and regulatory experience: former BNP Paribas USA Chairman J. Michael Shepherd, who was previously a senior deputy comptroller of the currency.\n\nThe company in recent months has also hired more than 200 new compliance officers who have experience at \"other companies that have to deal with challenges similar to this,\" Owen said.\n\nREGULATION AND COMPLIANCE\nThreat of a regulatory smackdown looms at Discover\nDiscover's board has hired an executive search firm to help find a new CEO and is \"acting with urgency,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this is a great job,\" Owen said, adding that the board has a \"strong list\" of internal and external candidates.\n\n\"I think we'll get the right person in the role in a fairly quick manner,\" he added.\n\nErika Najarian, a UBS analyst, noted that Discover's decision to turn to an interim CEO contrasts with the quick selection of a permanent CEO by other banks that needed major compliance overhauls.\n\nThat list, she said, includes Wells Fargo and Citigroup.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"This year, hotel sales experienced a steep decline statewide, according to Atlas Hospitality Group, which recently released its midyear 2023 California sales report. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a record number decline,\u201d said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, who\u2019s been tracking California hotel sales for more than 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of percentage drop.\u201d\n\nStatewide, sales decreased 53% during the first half of the year.\n\nReay said he sees numerous similarities between now and 2009. \n\nBut, what\u2019s even more interesting about this year\u2019s dramatic decline in sales is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily square with how hotels are doing, a marked contrast with 2009, when the U.S. was coming out of the Great Recession.\n\n\nMost hotels \u2013 specifically in Southern California \u2013 have recovered from all the residual impacts of Covid-19 in terms of an operational standpoint, with revenue and occupancy rates having generally returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cThe big cause of this decline is the rapid increase in interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cThe one word that would sum it up is \u2018disconnect.\u2019\u201d\n\nReay said the disconnect exists between the expectations of buyers and sellers \u2013 the prices that sellers are looking for are just not comparable with the cost buyers must pay for loans.\n\nThis has resulted in an uptick in the notice of default filings and foreclosures, as well as borrowers simply handing keys back to their lenders.\n\n\u201cI would call this an interest rate-driven downturn,\u201d Reay said, noting that despite numerous similarities to 2009, we are not in a recession now because the operational side of the hotel industry is performing relatively well. \n\nLos Angeles hotel sales\n\nIn Los Angeles County, only 17 hotels were sold in the first six months of the year compared to 36 in the same period last year. That\u2019s a decline of 53%, the same percentage drop as the state.\n\nLikewise, of those transactions, the number of rooms that sold last year was 2,894, as opposed to the 1,315 in the first six months of this year, a 55% decrease. Also, the median price per room declined by 13% this year.\n\nYet, last year the total sales price was $808,259,906, whereas this year the total sales price was $1,008,790,000, a 25% increase. \n\nIn addition, the average price per room this year is up 16% year over year, further illustrating the disconnect between the expectations of buyers and sellers. \n\nAnd beyond high interest rates, Measure ULA \u2013 the one-time real estate transfer tax unique to L.A. city properties valued at or above $5 million that went into effect on April 1 \u2013 has hit the L.A. hotel scene hard, with many owners delaying selling.\n\nIn the second quarter of last year, L.A. experienced 20 hotel sales priced above $5 million. In that same period this year, the only hotel sale the city of L.A. had above $5 million was the $760 million foreclosure sale of the Fairmont Century Plaza, a 394-room luxury hotel located in Century City, by the Reuben Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhat you have unique to Los Angeles is not only this huge decline in sales because of interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s compounded by the fact that you now have the mansion tax and owners are really holding off on selling.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reay, as long as interest rates remain at their current levels there will be more pressure on sellers and lenders to adjust their price expectations downward.

{"text":"August 29 - I can\u2019t recall a moment in my life when Africa and its people haven\u2019t been impacted by climate change. Data shows that in 2020, nine out of the 10 countries most affected by climate change were African. East Africa this year faced the worst drought it has faced in four decades, bringing catastrophic impacts to Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe conclusion is simple: without climate change, such events would not have happened.\n\nAfrican countries have historically contributed far less to climate change than others, yet Africa has been impacted more severely. It is on the cusp of its own rapid industrialisation, yet it must do so while reducing its emissions.\n\nThis is a very different kind of growth paradigm to contend with. But Africa has the potential to tap a new kind of growth, which is enshrined in what is being called green growth. This wholly new type of economic growth needs new approaches to infrastructure development, the adoption of new kinds of technologies and energy, and importantly, a new approach to finance that can stimulate economic growth without impacting the planet.\n\n\nAfrican countries are stepping up to the challenge and are willing to try new approaches. We\u2019ve already seen healthy and ambitious pledges from various countries, but these countries also make it clear that they need support to fully fund these commitments from the international and multi-lateral communities.\n\nFor example, South Africa has set an emissions reduction target of 28% by 2030, as long as \u201cadequate international support will be provided\u201d. Similarly, Ghana has committed to a reduction of 15% by itself, or 30% if international support is made available.\n\n\nThe funding gap to achieve Africa\u2019s commitments is vast. Estimates show that the continent needs $2.8 trillion by 2030 to fully fund the commitments that have already been announced.\n\nThis is why we need to see close partnership across different sources of funding \u2013 from the international community, African domestic capital sources and from the private sector \u2013 to deliver the required financial impact.\n\nAs co-chair of the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), I believe there is significant untapped potential within Africa to take the lead on deploying this finance to create a greener future for the continent, while helping tackle the global climate crisis.\n\nOne example is The African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), which was launched last year at COP27.\n\nVoluntary carbon markets (VCMs) can help to channel billions in investment that can build vibrant, green economies, while also contributing towards global climate action. Companies purchase carbon credits, which are issued by African developers, companies, communities and governments and finance carbon-removal or reduction projects such as forest regeneration and renewable energy. These projects also deliver additional co-benefits for local livelihoods and biodiversity.\n\nAfrica\u2019s potential in the supply of high-quality carbon credits is vast. Ghana, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo are just a handful of countries that have proactively sought to build and scale their domestic carbon markets.\n\nThe Wider Image: Senegalese plant circular gardens in Green Wall defence against desert\nAn area that is part of the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel on the outskirts of Walalde department in Senegal. Carbon credits can be used to finance forest regeneration schemes such as the Great Green Wall, the aim of which is to slow desertification across Africa's Sahel region, the arid belt south of the Sahara Desert. Acquire Licensing Rights Read more\n\nWe are also seeing coordination across the continent. ACMI is focused on driving growth in Africa\u2019s voluntary carbon markets, fostering activity that reduces or removes substantial amounts of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by promoting African carbon credits, mobilising significant capital and creating millions of associated jobs in Africa by 2030.\n\nGiven that the Africa Climate Summit is being held in Nairobi this week, I want to reflect on what must fall into place so Africa can build a vibrant and well-capitalised VCM that supports green growth while meaningfully contributing to global climate action.\n\nIntegrity is the first pillar. We need to firmly root end-to-end integrity into the VCM system. The handshake between the buyers and the sellers of carbon credits is a key connection where responsibility, accountability and transparency can be forged. Guidance and frameworks for what governs integrity in the VCM are also critical.\n\nThere are tools to help with this. The Integrity Council\u2019s Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) provide a standard for what high-quality credits should follow when they are created, and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative\u2019s (VCMI) Claims Code of Practice is a rulebook for companies purchasing carbon credits, providing guidance on when and how voluntary carbon credits can be used, and the \u201cclaims\u201d buyers can make about their climate impact achievements while using these credits.\n\nCritically, companies should only purchase carbon credits in addition to measurable, science-based emissions reduction pathways. In other words, they should not be used to continue business-as-usual emissions. Developers, sellers, and traders of carbon credits need to integrate governance, emissions impact and sustainable development outcomes for credits sold.\n\nEveryone involved in the VCM must hold each other accountable. This will firmly root end-to-end integrity in the VCM, which will ultimately establish trust.\n\nA Masai herder walks with grazing cattle \n\nThe second piece is action. We have already seen examples of countries and initiatives leading the way. But we must see more action across state and non-state actors in Africa and globally.\n\nThe international donor community needs to help encourage capacity, providing technical assistance for African countries and project developers, as well as technologies and systems to drive registration, verification and reporting.\n\nBuyers should begin engaging with the guidance that exists and remain confident about the market. Corporate buyers making significant commitments will also drive countries and developers to shape high-quality supply.\n\nThe third piece is a favourable environment and investment framework at a country level, that sets the VCM up for success.\n\nAfrican countries also need to decide whether, why, how and when to engage with VCMs and other carbon finance mechanisms. The VCMI released a VCM Access Strategy Toolkit, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme, highlighting the role of high-integrity VCMs in global climate mitigation efforts, and how countries can use VCM finance to benefit broader sustainable development, climate and nature policy priorities.\n\nThe final pillar is transparency and equity. There is a real opportunity for the African VCM to be truly fair and equitable, where the price of credits reflects the underlying value, and the proceeds are shared equitably to include local communities, indigenous peoples and other key stakeholders who have the most to gain and potentially lose from these projects. The VCM should be a market that works for people and the planet.\n\nIf we are to succeed in our global climate ambitions, we need a truly transformational way to finance these ambitions. The VCM is one such tool in an arsenal of financial interventions available to drive climate action. Let\u2019s work together to fulfil its full potential.","labels":["financial_success"]}
{"text":"No one wants a hurricane to make landfall. Among nature\u2019s most damaging events, hurricanes that hit land in the United States usually cause death, destruction and misery. They can also cause havoc to supply chains. \n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina was a 100,000-truckload event, requiring one of the largest relief and recovery supply deployments in U.S. history. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey prompted one of the greatest truck capacity crunches in recent history. \n\nHurricane Lee could cause massive supply chain disruptions if it lands in the United States\nHurricane Lee, which strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane on Wednesday, will likely become a major hurricane by Friday and a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150 mph by Saturday.\n\nLee is now in the Atlantic Ocean well east of any land. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects Lee to intensify quickly and become an extremely dangerous major hurricane. At this time, it is too early to know if Lee will hit any of the major Caribbean islands or the United States.\n\nHowever, if Lee \u2014 or any major hurricane \u2014 did make landfall near a major city, it could cause massive capacity disruptions for U.S. shippers just prior to the peak season run-up.\n\nIf a major hurricane is forecast to make landfall, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state-level agencies will soak up every available truck in the market for relief activities. \n\n\n\nShippers will face much higher freight rates. Shippers would be wise to lock in secure commitments (even at higher contract rates) for a potentially chaotic fourth quarter. At worst, they may be left without trucks to haul goods.\n\nHurricanes create massive demand surges. Rates that shippers locked in to carriers anticipating a slow second half may not work in a tight capacity environment. Many carriers will chase the higher-paying FEMA freight, often ditching shippers that they view as cheap or undesirable.\n\nFor shippers unsure about what to pay in the market, they could resort to high-frequency freight rate benchmarking tools, such as SONAR, or the implementation of index-linked contracts. \n\nImpact on infrastructure\nDepending on where a hurricane hits and its subsequent path over land, a variety of infrastructure can be impacted. Seaports in the path of a hurricane close and may take time to reopen, particularly if there is any damage. The same is true for airports, rail yards and track and certainly bridges and highways. \n\nSome hurricanes have done significant damage to key infrastructure, while others have done very little damage. \n\nRegardless, these storms usually impact key parts of a state\u2019s or region\u2019s infrastructure, if only in the sense of delays. Supply chains break down because of hurricanes; sometimes they are back up and running quickly, while at other times they can be subject to significant delays. \n\n\nHurricane relief efforts\nYears before founding FreightWaves, I ran Xpress Direct from 2002 to 2005. Xpress Direct was the on-demand emergency unit of U.S. Xpress. Over the course of four years dealing with hurricane activity, Xpress Direct handled in excess of 20,000 shipments and billed over $100 million in revenue in disaster-relief loads alone.\n\nHurricane-relief loads offer an opportunity for trucking companies to demonstrate to the public how critical trucking is, regardless of how challenging a mission might be. \n\nHurricane relief is the biggest dog-and-pony show you will ever see in trucking. But there is a certain satisfaction in being able to help people who are suffering.\n\nFreightWaves\u2019 ongoing coverage\nSince FreightWaves.com went online in 2017, it has covered the impact to the nation\u2019s transportation and supply chain of all the hurricanes that have hit the United States. \n\nFreightWaves will cover Hurricane Lee\u2019s path, preparations to deal with it and more \u2014 and will continue to do so through any major relief efforts. FreightWaves will do so for any and all natural disasters that strike the nation.\n\n\nSONAR users have access to our Critical Events Center, which provides real-time information on storm paths and impacts to supply chain infrastructure.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"CNN\n \u2014 \nHurricane Hilary is rapidly intensifying in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Mexico on Thursday and is on track to deliver potentially significant rain and flooding to parts of the Southwest as a weaker system starting this weekend.\n\nHilary is forecast to grow into a major hurricane later today and could reach Category 4 hurricane strength with winds of at least 130 mph, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warned.\n\nThe hurricane was about 550 miles south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Thursday morning, whipping up maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.\n\n\nThere remains a wide range of outcomes for the heaviest rain and strongest winds in the US as the storm moves north over the next couple of days along Mexico\u2019s Baja Peninsula. Small deviations in the hurricane\u2019s track could change the forecast for the most intense rain and wind.\n\nHilary\u2019s rainfall could arrive as early as Saturday in parts of the Southwest, with the worst of its impacts set to arrive in California early Monday.\n\nShifts in the forecast track will also affect which areas of northwestern Mexico will face the worst of Hilary\u2019s winds, which will be strong enough to snap trees, down power lines and cause significant damage to property closest to the storm\u2019s center.\n\nMudslides and flash flooding are possible from a general 3 to 6 inches of rain across Mexico\u2019s Baja Peninsula from Thursday to early Monday, with greater amounts possible in the higher terrain.\n\nSignificant flood potential\nHilary is expected to weaken significantly before it reaches Southern California and parts of the Southwest, but there\u2019s an increasing chance of significant impacts to these areas in the form of heavy rain and flooding.\n\nSouthern California could receive some of Hilary\u2019s heaviest rainfall. Widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches may fall there and in southern Nevada from Saturday through Monday. The heaviest rainfall is expected mainly Sunday and Monday. Locally higher amounts up to 6 inches are possible in areas impacted by the heaviest deluges.\n\nRainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible for parts of Arizona, Central California and northern Nevada.\n\nMultiple days of heavy rainfall will give the ground little opportunity to absorb moisture and can progressively worsen the flood threat.\n\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Wednesday that \u201cmultiple years\u2019 worth of precipitation\u201d could potentially fall in some of California\u2019s driest areas.\n\nOne of those places is Death Valley, California, the hottest place on Earth. Death Valley typically receives about 2 inches of rain across an entire year, according to NWS data. Moisture from Hilary could unleash enough rain to give Death Valley at least a year\u2019s worth of rainfall in a single day.\n\nRainfall this exceptional proved destructive in Death Valley last year. Around 1,000 people became stranded in Death Valley National Park last August when 1.46 inches of rain fell in 24 hours and unleashed flash flooding that washed away roads and entombed cars in floodwater-swept debris.\n\nDramatic weather changes for suffering Southwest\nDespite the flooding danger, the rainfall would help combat drought and recharge groundwater across parched portions of the Southwest. Drought conditions expanded in New Mexico and remained steady in California and Arizona this week, the US Drought Monitor reported Thursday.\n\nThe seasonal monsoon that supplies the region with a large percentage of its yearly rainfall has been missing for much of the summer, and cities like Phoenix are still waiting for measurable rainfall.\n\nThe combination of rainfall and increased cloud cover across the Southwest is expected to bring a significant cooldown over the weekend. Temperatures that have been in the upper 90s to 110s could drop by as much as 20 degrees.\n\nPhoenix may not reach a high temperature in the triple digits over the weekend for the first time since the middle of June.","labels":["natural_disasters"]}
{"text":"Poland was the only economy in the European Union to avoid recession during the 2008 global financial crisis. Even in 2009, when the whole EU went into recession, Poland continued to grow at 2.6 percent. Today, Poland\u2019s economy is a quarter larger than at the onset of the crisis, while the economy of the EU as a whole grew by only 0.7 percent (Figure 1).\n\nThis remarkable performance resulted from a number of factors, including timely fiscal and monetary stimulus, a large depreciation of the currency, and a relatively large domestic economy, which limited the country\u2019s exposure to falling international trade. In addition, growth was supported by growing inflows of funds from the European Union, a diversified export structure, and sustained confidence among Polish consumers and entrepreneurs.\n\nPoland\u2019s impressive performance has also been driven by a healthy banking sector. Polish banks remained profitable, liquid, and well-capitalized throughout the crisis. They did not need a single dollar of public support. In contrast to most other EU countries, Poland\u2019s banks managed to increase lending to the private sector during the crisis, supporting the country\u2019s growth.\n\nAn overlooked factor has been the counter-cyclical role of PKO BP\u2014a commercial public bank and the largest player in the Polish market with almost a 20 percent market share\u2014in helping to deal with the crisis.\n\nWhile foreign-owned banks, which controlled almost 75 percent of the banking sector\u2019s assets, were cutting lending in panic, PKO BP was expanding lending at the same time. Its loan portfolio increased by 1.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and represented 40 percent of total new bank lending in that year. The bank\u2019s lending increased for all market segments, including the crucial small and medium-sized enterprise sector.\n\nPKO BP\u2019s positive contribution to Poland\u2019s market liquidity during the global financial crisis contrasts with the often poor performance of other state-owned commercial and development banks around the world, which often suffer from weak corporate governance, misaligned incentives, and unclear mandates. The consensus is that while lending by state-owned banks can sometimes play a useful counter-cyclical role, \u201cthe track record of state banks in credit allocation remains generally unimpressive,\u201d despite a few success stories.\n\nWhat can explain the different behavior of PKO BP and Poland\u2019s foreign-owned banks? Four things:\n\n PKO BP\u2019s decision to expand credit was based on the country\u2019s strong economic fundamentals, while lending decisions of foreign-owned subsidiaries largely followed the risk-averse policies of their international parent banks.\nThe government supported the bank\u2019s rights and new share issue in 2009, which strengthened the bank\u2019s capital base and allowed for expansion of lending.\nPKO BP maintained a conservative funding structure before and during the crisis, which minimized its dependence on the moribund refinancing market. The bank\u2019s domestic deposits fully financed outstanding loans, in contrast to the market average, where loan-to-deposit ratio reached almost 120 percent.\nPKO BP improved its liquidity owing to an outflow of deposits from foreign-owned banks, early repurchase of long-term bonds by the National Bank of Poland, and a reduction in the mandatory reserve.\nPKO BP\u2019s increased lending during the crisis did not undermine the loan quality. The bank\u2019s non-performing loans (NPLs) have increased less than the market average during 2008-2011. In 2011, NPLs amounted to less than 8 percent of the bank\u2019s total assets, below the market average of almost 9 percent. At the end of 2014, the bank\u2019s NPLs amounted to 7.7 percent.\n\nThe case of Poland\u2019s PKO BP suggests that state-controlled banks can indeed play an important counter-cyclical role during crises by supporting lending to the economy. It also highlights the benefits of a diversified bank ownership structure. Foreign banks are likely to play a positive role in supporting financial deepening and mitigating endogenous crises, but domestically owned banks may come in handy when the sector is hit by exogenous crises.\n\nFor state-controlled banks to be successful, however, they need to be professionally managed, commercially oriented, open to free-market competition, and subject to hard budget constraints. Taking state-controlled banks public can help meet some of these conditions. PKO BP\u2019s stock market listing promoted adoption of international accounting standards, reduced political pressures and imposed market discipline. But market discipline alone is not likely to be sufficient; state-controlled banks are likely to perform well in countries with a well embedded culture of transparency, accountability, and responsibility. Achieving these, however, is far from straightforward.\n\nThis blog post reflects the personal views of the author and does not represent the position of the World Bank Group.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"For decades, the petroleum industry in South America has been dogged by one environmental catastrophe after another. Oil spills, flaring and other environmentally damaging incidents are commonplace and have been so for years. This has weighed heavily on the petroleum industry\u2019s social license in many countries with it seemingly locked in an ever-present state of crisis in Ecuador and Peru. It is the near failure of the Venezuelan state and collapse of PDVSA\u2019s petroleum infrastructure which has sparked an environmental catastrophe in that country. While those countries garner the lions share of attention concerning environmental damage caused by industry operations the hydrocarbon sector in Colombia is among the continent\u2019s worst perpetrators.\n\nFor decades Colombia\u2019s national government in Bogota has held out the Andean country's oil industry as a model of success. Despite Colombia possessing meagre proven reserves, totaling 1.8 billion barrels at the end of 2021 with a 6-year production life, the country punches above its weight when it comes to production volumes. For September 2022, Colombia\u2019s average daily oil output was 753,584 barrels per day. While that is far less then the one million barrels per day pumped during 2013 and 2015 it is still significantly higher than neighboring countries like Ecuador that possess larger oil reserves. Data from Colombia\u2019s regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH \u2013 Spanish initials) shows there are 447 various oil contracts assigned to energy companies with 233 production contracts currently active with the remainder being at the exploration stage or in a few instances for special projects and technical evaluation. Those numbers illustrate the size of Colombia\u2019s hydrocarbon sector and why the country punches well above its weight when its scant oil reserves are considered.\n\nThe rapid growth of Colombia\u2019s petroleum industry over the last three decades saw oil become a key economic driver, with it responsible for a third of exports by value, 3% of gross domestic product and around a fifth of government revenue. For those reasons, the Andean country despite its paltry reserves is highly dependent on its domestic petroleum industry. While Bogota has been quick to point to the hydrocarbon sector\u2019s successes, historically Colombia\u2019s national government has been less than forthcoming when it comes to disclosing the environmental and social damage the sector causes.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the number of oil spills that occur in Colombia. An investigation by Mongabay, a nonprofit environmental news platform, found that a Colombian government database shows there more than 2,133 environmentally damaging incidents involving the country\u2019s oil industry between 2015 and 2022. That number, which has been difficult to verify because of a lack of government transparency, is particularly startling because Peru, which is garnering considerable international attention for the environmental damage caused by its oil industry, has experienced a far lower incidence of such events. According to a 2022 report by Oxfam and Peru\u2019s National Coordinator for Human Rights (CNDDHH \u2013 Spanish initials) there were only 1,002 oil spills in Peru from 1997 until 2021. That is less than half the incidences which have purportedly occurred in Colombia over a far shorter period, although a lack of transparency makes it extremely difficult to verify the data. Colombian social and economic thinktank CrudoTransparente counted 54 oil spills from 2017 to 2021, but there is little other hard data available. This lack of transparency in a country where censorship of the media and the murder of environmental defenders is not surprising. There have been many allegations of collusion between the government, oil companies in Colombia and paramilitary groups, notably the Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC \u2013 Spanish initials) which officially disbanded in 2006. The various self defense groups that appeared in Colombia that eventually coalesced to form the AUC, which was a U.S. designated terrorist group, evolved from a nexus between business leaders, the Medellin Cartel and civil patrols established by Colombian authorities. While the AUC has disbanded, various neo-paramilitary bands, tracing their origin to that illegal armed group, have emerged. Aside from their involvement in coca cropping and cocaine trafficking they are believed to be heavily involved in intimidating as well as murdering defending environmental defenders with 322 executed over the last decade.\n\nThe number one offender for oil spills in Colombia is the country\u2019s largest hydrocarbon producer, only refiner and owner of the Andean country\u2019s pipelines national petroleum company Ecopetrol. The data reviewed by Mongabay showed that Colombia\u2019s national oil company was responsible for 67% of the environmental incidents, including oil spills, analyzed. Oil spills that occur in Colombia are not only the fault of energy companies operating in the country and caused by poor maintenance, operational failures or human error, in many cases they are the consequence of sabotage and petroleum theft. Sabotage of oil pipelines and assaults on oilfields by illegal armed groups have long been a significant problem in Colombia. Leftist guerillas the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC \u2013 Spanish initials), which demobilized in 2017, and the National Liberation Army (ELN \u2013 Spanish initials) regarded Colombia\u2019s petroleum industry as a legitimate target in their armed struggle against the state. The extortion of petroleum companies through threats of sabotage, kidnapping of key employees and hijacking of trucks carrying crude as well as supplies became a substantial source of income for the FARC and ELN during the 1990s. \nWhile the volume of attacks on industry infrastructure, primarily oil pipelines, which were a key cause of oil spills have diminished considerably since the FARC struck a 2016 peace agreement with Bogota the volume of oil theft is rising sharply. Soaring cocaine production, significantly higher fossil fuel prices and a crackdown by Colombian authorities on fuel smuggling have forced those illegal armed groups manufacturing cocaine to find an alternate cost-effective supply of gasoline. The oil stolen is shipped to primitive clandestine jungle refineries where it is processed into a very crude form of gasoline known as pategrillo or cricket-foot in English, because of its cloudy green color. Illicit demand for gasoline is soaring because it takes extremely substantial amounts, estimated to be 74 gallons to 86 gallons, of the fuel to process enough coca leaves to produce one kilogram of cocaine. It is coca leaves that contain the crucial alkaloid which forms the base of cocaine and must be soaked in gasoline for it be extracted eventually producing a white paste usually around 40% pure.\n\nColombia\u2019s cocaine production keeps soaring higher, reaching yet another record for 2021 when an estimated 1,400 metric tons was produced representing a 14% increase over the record set a year earlier. As cocaine production grows, fossil fuel prices rise and it becomes increasingly difficult for criminal groups to obtain the copious quantities of gasoline because of monitoring by Colombian authorities the volume of petroleum theft will keep rising. When the crude oil is shipped to a clandestine refinery it is estimated that typically only around 30% to 40% of the petroleum will be processed with the remainder discarded into the surrounding environment. It is for these reasons that oil theft in Colombia is spiraling ever higher. According to data from Colombia\u2019s National Police, obtained by Reuters, the volume of petroleum being stolen has tripled from 2018 to be an estimated 3,447 barrels per day. \n\nOil spills and other industry related environmentally damaging incidents are a constant hazard for Colombia\u2019s oil industry. When they occur, they have a disproportionate impact on Colombia\u2019s Indigenous and poor communities with much of the hydrocarbon sector operating in rural regions. The volume of damage is startling, especially when it is considered that Colombia is ranked as the third most biodiverse country globally, after Indonesia and Brazil. A lack of government and regulatory transparency makes it difficult to track the frequency of incidents, volume of spills and resulting environmental damage. It is for these reasons that the social license for Colombia\u2019s petroleum industry is deteriorating and significant opposition to the controversial hydrocarbon extraction technique of hydraulic fracturing exists.\n\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"TOYOTA CITY, Japan, Sept 19 (Reuters) - At factories in Japan's industrial heartland, Toyota (7203.T) has turned to self-propelled assembly lines, massive die casting and even old-fashioned hand polishing as it aims to make up for lost ground in battery electric vehicles.\n\nThe world's top-selling automaker believes it can close the gap with Tesla (TSLA.O) and others by combining new technology with the famous lean production methods it has used for decades to wring inefficiency, including excess costs, out of manufacturing.\n\nThe automaker gave a glimpse of its latest advances at a plant tour in central Japan last week, some for the first time. It also showed off examples of thrifty ingenuity, such as a technique to make high-gloss bumpers without any paint. The mold is hand polished to a mirror finish, giving the bumper its lustre.\n\nElsewhere, three-decade-old equipment used to process parts can now be run at night and on weekends after being automated through robotics and 3D modeling, improvements Toyota said had trebled equipment productivity.\n\n\"The strength of Toyota's manufacturing lies in our ability to respond to changing times,\" Chief Product Officer Kazuaki Shingo told reporters on the tour.\n\nHe pointed to engineering and technology expertise anchored in \"TPS\", shorthand for the Toyota Production System.\n\nToyota revolutionised modern manufacturing with its system of lean production, just-in-time delivery and \"kanban\" workflow organisation. Its methods have since been adopted everywhere from hospitals to software firms and studied widely in business schools and boardrooms around the world.\n\nThe relentless focus on continuous improvement and squeezing costs helped fuel Toyota's ascent from post-war upstart to global giant. But in battery EVs, it has been eclipsed by another tireless innovator, Tesla, which has used efficiencies of its own to build market-leading profitability.\n\nUnder new CEO Koji Sato, Toyota in June announced an ambitious plan to ramp up battery EVs, a big shift after years of criticism that the maker of the industry-leading hybrid Prius was slow to embrace fully electric technology.\n\nThe Japanese automaker accounted for only about 0.3% of the global EV market in 2022, Goldman Sachs said in June, calling a stronger offering the \"missing piece\" in its lineup.\n\nIt is not the only car company grappling with the challenges from shifting to EVs. Detroit's Big Three automakers have cited competitive pressure from Tesla as they push back against wage demands from the United Auto Workers union that last week led to an unprecedented simultaneous strike.\n\nASSEMBLY LINE, GIGACASTING\nOne innovation being emphasised by Toyota is its self-propelled production lines, where EVs are guided by sensors through the assembly line. The technology removes the need for conveyor equipment, a major expense in the car assembly process, and allows for greater flexibility in production lines.\n\nIn a demonstration, EVs inched along without a roof, allowing parts to be slotted in. A Fanuc (6954.T) robot arm lowered cars seats into the EV bed. Nearby, an autonomous forklift took more seats off a container.\n\nToyota also showed off a prototype of the die-casting technology known as \"gigacasting\" pioneered by Tesla that produces aluminium parts far bigger than anything used before in auto manufacturing.\n\nLike Tesla, Toyota says it will produce EVs in modular sections, reducing parts. But it also points to innovations of its own. Since it has been working with die-casting for years, it has developed molds that can be quickly replaced, which is periodically necessary in gigacasting.\n\nToyota says that reduces the time to change the mold to 20 minutes, versus 24 hours normally. It estimates a 20% boost in productivity.\n\nThe automaker has also introduced a self-driving transport robot at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City that ferries new vehicles across a 40,000 square metre (10 acre) parking lot, a job typically done by drivers before loading cars onto carrier trucks.\n\nTruck drivers walk on average 8 km (5 miles) a day fetching cars, eating into driving time and adding to the physical burden in a job where turnover is high.\n\nThe automaker said it aims to have 10 of the robots operating in Motomachi by next year and will consider other plants after. It could also sell the robots to other companies.\n\n","labels":["None"]}

Currently, there are about 160 million packages in the nation\u2019s delivery pipeline, according to ShipMatrix data.\n\nTypically, each local driver delivers 250 to 300 packages per day at this time in the peak cycle, ShipMatrix said. However, hazardous road conditions are limiting daily deliveries to about 150 parcels per driver, the firm said.\n\nThe bad weather has even caused delays for the 20% of parcels moving via air in premium-priced express services, Jindel said.\n\nUntil the widespread cold snap of the past 2 to 3 days, the delivery carriers were holding their own in on-time delivery performance. From Dec. 8 to Dec. 17, UPS Inc.\u2019s (NYSE: UPS) on-time delivery rate stood at 97.9%, FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) stood at 96.8% and the U.S. Postal Service clocked in at 94.4%, according to ShipMatrix data.\n\n\n\nIt has been nine years since inclement weather played a part in triggering significant delivery delays during Christmas Week. In 2013, millions of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) parcels did not arrive on time, courtesy not only of the elements but of Amazon flooding UPS with millions of last-minute deliveries that UPS was not prepared for. The fiasco led Amazon to accelerate plans to build an in-house delivery network.","labels":["natural_disasters"]}
{"text":"Yellow Corp. (NASDAQ: YELL) has failed to make its required pension contributions for June and is planning to withhold payments for July. The pension funds, pension accruals and health care coverage for workers will suspend on Sunday, according to a statement by the Teamsters. \n\nThe Teamsters union has threatened to strike by Monday if this is not resolved and the pension contributions remain in default. The company owes $50 million, a large sum for a company in financial distress. Yellow currently has in excess of $100 million in cash reserves, according to an 8-K filed on July 7. \n\nIf a strike comes to pass, this would likely be the end for the storied less-than-truckload carrier. \n\nWhile there is a lot of noise around the Yellow story, one thing is clear: Management is aware of the risks of not paying into the pension fund. They would have only missed a pension payment out of dire necessity, not convenience. \n\nAfter all, this is not an Elon Musk-style default \u2014 \u201cI am not going to pay this because I don\u2019t want to\u201d \u2014 but rather a decision that is borne out of a lack of sufficient funds to cover the payments. \n\nYellow\u2019s management likely knew that not paying the funds would force the Teamsters\u2019 hands. Perhaps they were hoping for a last-minute government bailout and decided that not paying the pension payment would allow for a few more weeks of liquidity until that bailout came.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the reason for the company\u2019s decision not to pay, it knew that defaulting would breach its contract with the Teamsters and that it would face retaliation from a battle-ready leader in Sean O\u2019Brien. \n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s public statements and Twitter feed would suggest he is ready for a Yellow bankruptcy. On June 24, he posted a photo on Twitter \u2014 he goes by @TeamsterSOB \u2014 of a tombstone with Yellow\u2019s name and the dates 1924-2023. \n\n\nO\u2019Brien, a regular Twitter poster, last tweeted about Yellow on June 27. Since then, his feed has been dedicated to UPS. \n\nIf O\u2019Brien has written off the 22,000 Teamster jobs at Yellow, you can bet that there is little hope for the company\u2019s future. \n\nWhat Yellow customers can do\nYellow\u2019s customers have options, however. \n\nAccording to channel checks conducted by FreightWaves, many of Yellow\u2019s shipping customers have been preparing for the prospect of a shutdown, but not all have not acted upon it as of yet. This will likely change this week. \n\n\nSupply chain decision-makers would be wise to consider an alternative to Yellow as soon as possible. No shipping customer wants to be caught in a Yellow shutdown; there is a big chance that shippers won\u2019t see their freight for months \u2014 if ever. \n\nOnce a strike takes place, Yellow\u2019s revenue would drop to almost zero, as almost all of its revenue is dependent upon union labor. And it is unlikely that it could recover, short of an improbable government bailout. The cash burn would be insurmountable and the company would be forced into bankruptcy within days or weeks. \n\nFreight tendered this week that is still in Yellow\u2019s network would likely be abandoned at terminal locations across the country. These terminals would be unsecure and attractive locations for criminals to target, especially after a few weeks. \n\nYellow\u2019s terminal real estate is pledged to the bondholders. They would be responsible for liquidating the real estate portfolio. It could take months. The agencies that are responsible for liquidation are not going to concern themselves with freight that is left behind in Yellow\u2019s network. \n\nLinehauls won\u2019t be moving freight between terminals. There is a chance that outside contractors that are part of Yellow\u2019s linehaul network would hold freight hostage, demanding some form of payment for services rendered.  \n\nFor shipping customers, customer service jobs would likely be eliminated almost immediately and there would be no chance of getting in touch with anyone to help sort out where the freight is, much less recover it. And worst of all, there will be no one to file a claim at the carrier. Even if by some miracle you were able to do so, you would be an unsecured creditor with an infinitely small chance of recovering anything in a liquidation. \n\n\nWhile no one likes to see a storied company shutter or 30,000 people lose their jobs, a Yellow shutdown would happen at a time when the trucking industry could absorb the volume. The trucking economy is very weak right now. Capacity is abundant and Yellow\u2019s competitors have been preparing for its failure for the past few months. \n\nEven if LTL networks get stretched (Yellow represents an estimated 10% of the total LTL volume), shippers will find plenty of linehaul capacity to purchase from the truckload industry. This could provide a welcome catalyst for Yellow\u2019s competitors and the truckload sector. \n\nMarket volatility is likely to be a factor. Yellow largely relied upon its own Teamsters power to run linehaul services between terminals. The loss of this capacity could play havoc on the broader freight network for a few months as routing guides get reset. ","labels":["financial_distress","supplychain"]}

{"text":"Home  Americas\nUS Begins Probe Into Chinese Cyberattack On Joe Biden Admin\u2019s Emails; Hackers Expose Porous Security Gaps\nBy NC Bipindra -August 16, 2023\n\n\nMultiple American security agencies have begun a probe into a serious breach allegedly by a Chinese hackers group into Joe Biden administration\u2019s email accounts supplied by American software giant Microsoft, raising the alarm over sensitive information from those emails that may have fallen into foreign hands.\n\nWhile the US Congress launched an investigation into recent cyber espionage campaigns allegedly linked to China that led to the successful breach of several government email accounts within the State and Commerce departments earlier this month, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) too tasked its Cyber Safety Review Board to go into the cloud security and examine the recent cyberattack that targeted government email accounts, the US-based Nextgov\/FCW reported.\n\nThe DHS\u2019s Cyber Safety Review Board, composed of 15 cybersecurity leaders across the public and private sectors, will probe how threat actors target cloud computing environments for malicious purposes. The review will also assess how Lapsus$, a hacking group reportedly linked to China, leveraged a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Online to access unclassified government emails in the cyberattack.\n\nThe cyberattack was described by a senior Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) official as a \u201csurgical campaign\u201d targeting a \u201csmall number of mailboxes.\u201d DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, on the other hand, described cloud security as \u201cthe backbone of some of our most critical systems\u201d in a statement announcing the new review on August 11.\n\n\u201cOrganizations of all kinds are increasingly reliant on cloud computing to deliver services to the American people, which makes it imperative that we understand the vulnerabilities of that technology,\u201d Mayorkas said.\n\nThe Cyber Safety Review Board, which does not have regulatory authority, will aim to develop best practices that software providers and cloud users across sectors can employ to bolster network security.\n\nUS Congress Seeks Probe\nThe announcement comes after calls from Congress for federal investigations into the cyberattack, including from Democrat Senator Ron Wyden, who urged CISA and the attorney general to take action against Microsoft related to allegations of negligent cybersecurity practices he asserted in a letter last month. \u201cGovernment emails were stolen because Microsoft committed another error,\u201d Wyden wrote in his letter.\n\nWyden was happy over the DHS Cyber Safety Review Board announcing the investigation. \u201cHad the Board studied the 2020 SolarWinds hack, as President Biden originally directed, its findings might have been able to shore up federal cybersecurity in time to stop hackers from exploiting a similar vulnerability in the most recent incident.\n\nThe government will only be able to protect federal systems against cyberattacks by getting to the bottom of what went wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\nWyden noted in his July letter that the Cyber Safety Review Board was established in response to the 2020 SolarWinds hack but never delivered on a probe of the breach, and Microsoft\u2019s role in it, despite the lawmaker\u2019s urging.\n\n\u201cI have repeatedly pushed CISA and DHS to direct the Board to study the SolarWinds incident but have been rebuffed. Had that review taken place, it is quite likely that Microsoft\u2019s poor data security practices around encryption keys would have come to light, and this most recent incident might have been averted,\u201d Wyden wrote.\n\nLapsus$ Investigations\nThe DHS Cyber Safety Review Board had on August 10 released its report on Lapsus$, which was found to have \u201cleveraged simple techniques to evade industry-standard security tools\u201d and avoid detection while accessing critical networks.\n\nAccording to the report, cybercriminals like Lapsus$ used techniques like phishing employees and stealing cell phone numbers to gain access to proprietary data. The review featured ten actionable recommendations that government agencies, companies, and others can employ to bolster cyber defenses against Lapsus$ and other threat actors.\n\nThe report said standard multi-factor authentication techniques featured critical vulnerabilities that left major companies susceptible to cyber intrusions. \u201cLapsus$ and related threat actors are using basic techniques to gain an entry point into companies,\u201d Rosa Smothers, a government relations executive at the security firm KnowBe4 and former CIA cyber threat analyst, was quoted by Nextgov\/FCW.\n\n\u201cTheir primary attack vectors \u2013 SIM swap attacks and phishing employees \u2013 can be easily addressed, especially for companies like Microsoft and Okta that are so well resourced.\u201d The Board recommended organizations \u201cimmediately switch to more secure, easy-to-use, password-less solutions by design\u201d and called on the government to develop a \u201csecure authentication roadmap\u201d that helps accelerate the adoption of password-less authentication.\n\nCSRB Chair and DHS Under Secretary for Policy, Robert Silvers, said the review \u201cuncovered deficiencies in how companies ensure their vendors\u2019 security; how cell phone carriers protect their customers from SIM swapping; and how organizations authenticate users on their systems. \u201cThe board examined how a loosely organized group of hackers, some of them teenagers, were consistently able to break into the most well-defended companies in the world,\u201d Silvers said.\n\nUS Congress Seeks Cyber Espionage Briefing After Microsoft Letter\nThe US Congress, Nextgov\/FCW reported on August 2, launched an investigation into recent cyber espionage campaigns allegedly linked to China that successfully breached several government email accounts within the State and Commerce departments.\n\nIn separate letters to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Republican leaders of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability requested briefings from both officials on the discovery, impact, and response to the intrusions.\n\nRepresentational Image\nRepresentational Image\nOn its part, Microsoft previously released a report that said a China-based cybercriminal gained access to an unspecified number of unclassified government email accounts through forged authentication tokens and a flaw in its cloud-computing environment that has since been patched.\n\nThe letters note that the breach began on May 15 \u201cand operated in stealth for more than a month\u201d before Microsoft began its investigation into the espionage campaign.\n\n\u201cChina appears to be graduating from \u2018smash and grab heists\u2019 that used to be \u2018noisy\u2019 and \u2018rudimentary\u2019 to a level described by security experts as \u2018among the most technically sophisticated and stealthy ever discovered,'\u201d the letters said.\n\n\u201cThe incident even raises the possibility that Chinese hackers may be able to access high-level computer networks and remain undetected for months if not years.\u201d\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters in July that the agency \u201ctook immediate steps to secure our systems\u201d and notified Microsoft of the breach. However, he declined to specify the date the intrusion was detected. Miller also declined to indicate whether the breach was connected with Secretary Blinken\u2019s recent trip to China.\n\nThe intrusions have been associated with a China-based actor known as Storm-0558. According to Microsoft, the cyberattack accessed email accounts at approximately 25 separate organizations through the company\u2019s Outlook Web Access in Exchange Online and Outlook.com. \u201cThis type of espionage-motivated adversary seeks to abuse credentials and gain access to data residing in sensitive systems,\u201d Microsoft said in an announcement about the hack.\n\nThe letters also note that the hack further underscores a warning about China included in the National Cybersecurity Strategy released earlier this year, which calls the country \u201cthe broadest, most active, and most persistent threat to both government and private sector networks.\u201d\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, separately, wrote to the heads of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and CISA on July 27 to request a probe into Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity practices that, he says, facilitated the espionage campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first espionage operation in which a foreign government hacked the emails of United States government agencies by stealing encryption keys and forging Microsoft credentials,\u201d Wyden noted in his letter.\n\nThe lawmaker detailed multiple problems with the company\u2019s methods of securing encryption keys and said, \u201cthat these flaws were not detected raises questions about what other serious cybersecurity defects these auditors also missed.\u201d\n\nCISA Outlines New Cybersecurity Strategic Plan\nEarlier this month, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it prioritizes addressing immediate threats, hardening digital terrain, and implementing security at scale, among nine other objectives outlined in its new Cybersecurity Strategic Plan.\n\nReleased on August 4, the plan marks CISA\u2019s roadmap for the next three years as the agency works with the Biden administration to safeguard America\u2019s digital networks from the increased onslaught of malicious cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cNow is the moment where our country has a choice: to invest in a future where collaboration is a default rather than an exception; where innovation in defense and resilience dramatically outpaces that of those seeking to do us harm; and where the burden of cybersecurity is allocated toward those who are most able to bear it,\u201d the executive summary of the report reads. \u201cCyber incidents have caused too much harm to too many American organizations. Working together, we can change this course.\u201d\n\nThe nine objectives underpinning the strategy and its three overarching goals include prioritizing coordinated threat disclosure, proactive vulnerability analyses, and implementing cybersecurity investments, among other tenants.\n\nThe plan will focus on outcome-based measures for institutions working to reduce their cybersecurity risk. Some of these metrics are centered around reducing incident response time, particularly for federal agencies and critical infrastructure partners.\n\nOther metrics focus on strategic increases. In measuring the efficacy of agency collaborations, CISA is focused on analyzing the increases in the volume of relevant information, in addition to more specific actionable plans and post-incident reports. Notably, the strategy also focuses on implementing the federally-backed secure-by-design concept.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we can no longer accept a model where every technology product is vulnerable the moment it is released and where the overwhelming burden for security lies with individual organizations and users,\u201d the report reads. \u201cTechnology should be designed, developed, and tested to minimize the number of exploitable flaws before they are introduced to the market.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of federal mandates and legislation, tech companies still operate under a voluntary and trust-based collaboration model. CISA \u201cwill strive to ensure that regulators and other government entities with compulsory authorities leverage technically sound and effective practices developed together with our partners across the private sector, ideally enabling harmonization across both US and global regulatory regimes.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes that CISA will produce and regularly update criteria to develop and maintain secure-by-design products and ensure manufacturer cooperation.\n\nArtificial intelligence software and quantum computing are highlighted as potentially risky technologies that threaten current cybersecurity protocol, particularly with the coming of an operational quantum computer.\n\nCISA\u2019s strategy to mitigate these emerging threats is to work with the developers of these nascent technologies and prepare digital systems through post-quantum cryptographic migrations.","labels":["None"]}

And the issues are likely to linger for as much as a decade, a CBS News investigation found. \n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his office is now actively investigating several airlines for what a spokesperson described as \"unrealistic scheduling\" \u2014 practices that overstate a carrier's ability to service the tickets they sell, which can contribute to flight disruptions, including delays and cancellations.  \n\nThe aviation industry is short roughly 32,000 commercial pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers \u2014 and the gap widens every year, a CBS News analysis of data from the FAA, U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Department of Labor shows. \n\n\"There's definitely gaps in places,\" said Buttigieg. \"The system is just uneven right now.\" \n\nButtigieg acknowledged the staffing shortages are contributing to a surge in flight cancellations and delays that have affected millions of American travelers in recent months. \n\nWhen CBS News asked Buttigieg if his office should be holding airlines accountable and telling them not to schedule flights when there's not enough staff to fly them, the secretary was unequivocal.   \n\n\"If an airline is knowingly flying an unrealistic schedule, there are going to be consequences,\" Buttigieg said.  \n\n\"We have active investigations underway right now with regard to that,\" Buttigieg said. \"We take that very seriously because when you sell a ticket to a paying customer and you make a profit off of that, you better be ready to do everything in your power to service that ticket. And we're also going to hold you responsible for what happens if you can't.\" \n\n\"If you look at the delays, for example, that America experienced through last year in the summer 2022, a lot of that was driven by these companies not having the staff that they needed, Buttigieg said. \"This is not something that's going to be worked out overnight. It took years to get this way.\" \n\n\nCBS News analysis of the data provided by FlightAware shows that the number of delays caused by issues within air carriers' control has jumped from 5.2% in 2018 to 7.6% in 2023, a rise of thousands of delayed flights.  \n\n\"Unrealistic scheduling practices\" \nAirlines often blame the weather for delays. But staffing shortages can make those worse.  \n\nAnd it shows in the data.   \n\nThe pressure on the system became clear during a recent four-day period this summer: June 24-27, when 31,850 flights \u2014 a third of all flights nationwide \u2014 were delayed. During that time, airlines canceled 6,346 scheduled flights.  \n\nThat's one in every 17 flights canceled outright.  \n\nThe number of delays during those four days was 25% higher than in the same period last year. And when compared to the same period in 2019, before the pandemic, the number of cancellations was up 374%.    \n\nSecretary Buttigieg's office confirmed to CBS News that Southwest Airlines is among the carriers under investigation but declined to name other airlines involved in the department probe or give a timeline for that process. \n\n\nAt the time of publication, Southwest Airlines had not responded to a request from CBS News for comment.  \n\nIn late December, Southwest canceled thousands of flights during a massive winter storm. At the time, the airline issued a public apology for the disruptions, saying \"we've let our customers and employees down.\"  \n\nThe secretary's action comes in the wake of repeated calls for the Department of Transportation to provide a stronger response to increasing flight delays and cancellations as the country emerges from the pandemic. \n\n\nAccording to the DOT, from Dec. 24 to Dec. 31, 2022, software and staffing issues forced Southwest Airlines to cancel 14,042 flights, or 72.3% of all canceled flights nationwide, leaving passengers stranded around the country. \n\nAnd on Dec. 16, 2022, growing frustrated with rising complaints from consumers about ongoing flight disruptions, a bipartisan group of 34 state attorneys general wrote a letter to Secretary Buttigieg, saying \"the USDOT has yet to develop the ability to respond quickly enough to or coordinate effectively with our offices.\" \n\nAmong several recommendations, the attorneys general wrote that \"USDOT should require airlines to advertise and sell only flights that they have adequate personnel to fly and support, and perform regular audits of airlines to ensure compliance and impose fines on airlines that do not comply.\" \n\nMonths before that, in June 2022, U.S. Senators Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, and Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, both Democrats, wrote letters to the CEOs of 10 different airlines to demand corrective action.  \n\n\n\"While the industry has blamed these disruptions on unexpected weather and air traffic control issues, the data suggests the airlines themselves are at fault for many flight delays and cancellations,\" the senators wrote.   \n\n \"Airlines should have significant notice that they lack the crew to meet a certain flight schedule and, therefore, any shortages should not result in last-minute flight cancellations,\" the senators continued. \n\nKathleen Bangs, spokeswoman for flight tracking website FlightAware and a former commercial pilot, says when pending weather is a factor, it can be hard for airlines to predict how much to reduce flight schedules to spare passengers from travel headaches. \n\n\"How bad does it have to be?\" said Bangs. \"How widespread, how much of an impact do we think it's going to have at this airport, in that airport, to know how much we need to pare back those schedules? And I think, of course, they wanted to accommodate people.\" \n\n\nAirlines-4-America, the association which represents seven of the nation's biggest carriers, declined to talk with CBS News about flight disruptions and the impact of staffing shortages. In an email, a spokesperson said the airlines have \"reduced their schedules to reflect current operating realities,\" adding that they're \"hiring aggressively to make sure they have the right people in the right place at the right time.\" \n\n\"U.S. airlines recognize the importance of securing a pipeline of new employees\u2014pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and others\u2014and have established new pilot training programs, enhanced recruitment efforts and implemented programs to address financial hurdles,\" the spokesperson wrote. \n\n\"We can't catch up\"   \nThere's no doubt the staffing shortage \"affects us now,\" said Wichita State University emeritus associate professor Dean Headley. \"They are leaving planes on the ground because they don't have enough people to fly them for ground crews or anything like that.\" \n\nIn the past five years, flights reduced up to 48% in nation's busiest routes\nAirlines have cut a million flights, impacting some of the nation's busiest routes. One reason for the reduction in flights: airlines don't have enough staff to keep all those planes in the air.\n\nHeadley conducted marketing analyses on U.S. commercial airlines for decades at the W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State before retiring and assuming his current emeritus role there. Headley has published the Airline Quality Rating since 1991.  \n\n\n\"The airlines are doing about as much as they can [to improve staffing levels]. They can train about 1,500 to 1,800 pilots a year,\" Headley said.  \n\nBut since the industry is short about 17,000 pilots right now, \"we can't catch up that quick,\" he said. \n\nBecause of the current staffing shortage, commercial airlines have \"cut back flights to smaller regional airports. So, people [who] are not at a major airport will find that their flight schedules have been reduced simply because they don't have enough people to put in an airplane to fly it somewhere,\" Headley explained. \n\nAccording to a letter to the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee dated June 21, 2023, the Regional Airline Association (RAA) said airlines have already left 73 different markets since 2019 and 321 airports have lost some air service. According to the RAA, 61 airports have lost more than half their flights and 16 airports have lost all their major commercial flights. \n\nDean Headley says that smaller airports and cities can expect to see airlines cut back their routes there as they struggle to meet demand. \n\nWhat's worse, the data and industry experts, including Headley, say the trend in staffing issues points to a problem that could get a lot worse before it gets better and could affect your travel plans for another decade. \n\n\"Some of the predictions I'm hearing is that the pilot shortage won't be resolved until 2032 or something like that,\" Headley said.  \n\n\nThis worker shortage problem has been building for years but was made worse after the COVID pandemic forced airlines to drastically cut back on their routes and lay off thousands of workers. This prompted many pilots, flight attendants and maintenance workers to take early retirement or leave the industry altogether. When the flying public returned to the airports in 2022 and 2023, the airlines simply didn't have enough people to meet the new demand. \n\nTraining a pilot can take two years or longer and cost more than $100,000. And, by law, commercial pilots must retire at age 65.   \n\nAviation consultant Oliver Wyman predicts that because of that mandatory retirement the industry will be short 24,000 pilots by the year 2026 before the gap between trained pilots and the nation's commercial demand slowly begins to close. \n\nNot just pilots \nIt's the same story with aviation mechanics or maintenance technicians, as well as air traffic controllers. \n\nThe flying public's demand for flights is rising while the number of these critical workers is falling. \n\nWhile the number of people boarding planes has risen to record levels only seen just before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers working to move all those passengers and planes isn't keeping up with that demand.  \n\nThere aren't enough of these key air travel workers to meet demand\nBetween 2013 and 2022, the number of passengers increased by a greater percent than the number of pilots, while the number of air traffic controllers, mechanics and repairmen actually decreased.\n\n\"That is the big unsung shortage that nobody talks about,\" said Bangs of FlightAware. \"Most people don't understand that about half of all airline maintenance is done overseas. So, we outsource a lot of that maintenance and I think it's going to be challenging. We have to figure out a way \u2014 how do we attract young people to become mechanics, which are critical, but also at the same time they're outsourcing more and more of their work?\" \n\nProper training and certification can take 18 months to two years. Because of that time lag, consultant Oliver Wyman predicts a shortage of 18,000 mechanics in the coming years. \n\nThe worker shortfall includes perhaps the most important job to ensure the safety of the flying public, air traffic controllers. \n\nAir traffic controllers must attend a specialized academy for two to five months, then complete two to five years of on-the-job training before they can become fully certified. That process can cost a potential worker $35,000 or more. By law air traffic controllers must retire at age 56. \n\nRight now, CBS News analysis shows that there is a shortage of about 3,000 fully-certified air traffic controllers to meet current demand. \n\nWe are 3,000 air traffic controllers short of meeting demand.\nAir traffic controllers decreased by 11% while domestic airplane ridership has increased by 16% in the past decade.\n% change (air traffic controllers)\n2013-2022\n-65\n0\n+25\n\nPassenger counts represent the sum of originating and connecting passengers on all air carriers. An individual taking multiple flights is counted multiple times.\nMap: Dilcia Mercedes, CBS News  Source: Federal Aviation Administration\nA June 21, 2023, report by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Inspector General raises other serious concerns about that shortfall and takes the FAA to task for making \"limited efforts to ensure adequate controller staffing\" around the country.  The OIG found that in 20 of the 26 critical control towers in the United States, staffing fell well below the FAA's own 85% minimum threshold. And in New York TRACON (54%), Miami Tower (66%) and New York Center (68%) staffing is critically low. \n\nAll of this concerns 30-year veteran pilot Captain Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots' union. \n\n\"What I'm seeing is the system is under super pressure,\" Tajer said. Right now, \"we are sustaining that margin of safety ... but eventually it's like anything and something's going to give.\" \n\nOne possible solution to this shortage that's been embraced by government leaders and the airline industry: expanding the aviation workforce to include women and minorities once excluded from these jobs. U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that historically aviation jobs were made up of 95% White men. \n\n\"A lot of Americans have been underrepresented in aviation in the past,\" Secretary Buttigieg said. \"We've got to make sure that every kind of American who might be disposed to thrive in an aviation career sees that they could have a future, whether it's as a pilot, an air traffic controller, a mechanic.\" Multiple programs are trying to recruit a diverse workforce to fill the available jobs. \n\nOne is the Aviation Institute of Maintenance (AIM), which operates 15 campuses located across the United States.  Currently AIM is training about 4,200 students to become aviation maintenance technicians.  \n\nBoeing estimated the U.S. alone will need 178,000 aircraft mechanics, and more than 600,000 worldwide.\n\n\"The shortage is real, it's impacting everyone who engages in air travel, and it's an issue we have to address or ticket prices are going to continue to go up and the delays will continue to plague us,\" said AIM's vice president, Joel English. \n\n\"What we do in our classes is make sure that we're appealing to every type of individual who's looking for a great career pathway,\" said English. \"Looking around [at] our students, you'll see almost an even mix between Caucasian, African American and races like Hispanic and Asian. Our student body, about 15% female.\"  \n\nWhile 15% female students is still low, English says it is much higher than the current 2% of women mechanics in aviation today. \n\nIn 2022, 1,546 students graduated from AIM; 1,231 of them became certified aircraft technicians. English says the school has successfully placed more than 70% of its graduates in aviation industry jobs. \n\nNancy Tovar, a 33-year-old mother of two, has gone back to school to learn to become an airline mechanic near Dallas. \n\n\"I was a stay-at-home mom before I came into school,\" Tovar said. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do in life up until recently, and I just became a single mom. So that definitely motivated me and pushed me to figure out what's out here. And, you know, usually women\u2026 you don't see a lot of women in these kinds of professions.\" \n\n\"They only saw me as mom cleaning and cooking at home. And now they see me as mom is going to be working on this airplane that's flying and maybe the next one. And so, whenever they see a plane in the sky, they're going to be like, 'Mom, that's going to be you working on that one.'\" \n\nThere are also pilot schools that cater to only female pilots.  \n\nSome programs are working to attract future aviation workers while still in their early teens. A private specialty high school in the Dallas area is designed to teach students not only basic reading, writing and arithmetic but the skills of aerodynamics and flying. \n\nRising Aviation High School provides a traditional curriculum with an emphasis on STEM and aviation-related studies. The school even prepares students to get their private pilot's licenses. \n\nJocelyn Bruce, a junior, wants to attend the Air Force Academy and then fly for the Air Force before transitioning to piloting private charter or cargo planes. \n\n\"You would find that a lot of young girls, a lot of especially Black women really like aviation,\" Bruce said. \"They just never been told that it's something that they can do. So, a lot of them don't. They don't pursue. They don't pursue it.\" \n\nBruce admitted that embarking on her studies at the school put her out of her comfort zone. \n\n\"It made me a little nervous at first, but I got acclimated and comfortable,\" Bruce said. \"Now it's second nature.\" \n\nBoth Bruce and Tovar said the government could help by providing more scholarships and educational grants to aspiring professionals like them. \n\nThat's something Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg agreed is an idea worth considering. \n\n\"I don't believe that taxpayers should pay for something that companies should be doing on their own,\" said Buttigieg. \"But I do think it's a fair question why you would get more subsidy or support if you're going out to be a dentist then if you're going out to be a pilot (or aviation professional.) And we're looking right now what we might be able to do to true that up and to make sure that more people are supported who will have a great good paying career.\" \n\nButtigieg acknowledged that there currently are \"some gaps in what we do as a country when it comes to how we support the funding of the education for people to get into some of these fields.\" \n\n\"Student loans are something that are subsidized when you're going to a four-year university,\" Buttigieg said. \"But if you're going into one of these mechanics' programs, it's not quite the same. That's something I think we need to look at a policy level.\" \n","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"McDonald\u2019s\n will begin virtual focus groups with some owners and operators as a part of an ongoing civil rights audit, according to a message to franchisees viewed by CNBC.\n\nThe fast food giant retained WilmerHale law firm to conduct the examination of its practices, the memo said.\n\nLast year, shareholders approved of a proposal by SOC Investment group to conduct a civil rights audit in a close vote. At the time, SOC urged shareholders to back the measure ahead of the company\u2019s annual meeting, saying, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s plans do not adequately address the company\u2019s civil rights impact because it largely overlooks concerns with franchisees, which make up 95% of its U.S. restaurants.\u201d\n\nThe audit aims to determine whether the company\u2019s policies have an adverse impact on McDonald\u2019s U.S. stakeholders, including franchisees, employees, suppliers and customers.\n\nWilmerHale will partner with Perception Strategies, a \u201cnationally recognized research and consulting group focused on issues of identity, dignity, and belonging, to enhance our understanding of the experience of Owner\/Operators across the country and to help the company continue to promote fairness and opportunity within our system,\u201d the memo said.\n\n\u201cAs part of this initiative, Perception Strategies will conduct a Climate and Belonging Assessment to gain deeper insights into the experiences of our U.S. Owner\/Operators,\u201d the memo continued.\n\nThe document added that the assessment would involve inviting randomly selected franchisees to participate in one-hour virtual focus groups about their experiences. The note also assured owners that neither McDonald\u2019s nor anyone employed by the company would participate in the groups or the selection process.\n\nThe memo said the process is voluntary and identities would not be shared with McDonald\u2019s, and another notice said the groups would have no more than 12 people. An owner told CNBC that some franchisees were expressing concern about the 12-person panels and potential retaliation by the company.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it has high corporate governance standards and a long history of being responsive to shareholders, and looks forward to reviewing the outcome of the WilmerHale audit. The process began last year following the 2022 shareholders\u2019 meeting and is now gathering feedback from a range of stakeholders.\n\nThe audit comes as McDonald\u2019s has made changes to its franchising structure and restaurant grading system in recent years. In December 2021, McDonald\u2019s pledged to recruit more franchisees from diverse backgrounds, committing $250 million over the next five years to help those candidates finance a restaurant.\n\nCurrent and former Black franchisees have sued the company, alleging racial discrimination. One of the suits was dismissed, while an action brought by former MLB player Herb Washington resulted in a $33.5 million settlement from McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe company also faces two separate lawsuits from media mogul Byron Allen, alleging discrimination in its advertising practices. McDonald\u2019s has fired back against Allen in recent weeks, filing a motion for sanctions against the media companies owned by Allen. It claimed one of his suits was \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cfilled with allegations that he knows are false.\u201d\n\nThe company has also committed to increase its advertising spending with Black-owned media from 2% to 5% of its ad expenses by 2024. In the filing responding to Allen, it said it was on track to meet those goals.\n\nOther major companies including Citi, Starbucks, Amazon and Airbnb have undertaken civil rights and racial equity audits in recent years, and last year Apple shareholders approved a proposal for a similar assessment.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"OpenAI is trying to dismiss various claims in two legal actions launched by authors and comedians, who sued the machine-learning super-lab for scraping their books to train ChatGPT without explicit permission. \n\nIn June, novelists Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in the US over its harvesting of prose. Days later, comedian Sarah Silverman and novelists Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey also sued the biz. Both parties accused the ChatGPT maker of copyright infringement for ingesting their work to train the chatbot.\n\nOpenAI's lawyers have hit back, asking a federal court in San Francisco to dismiss five out six claims brought by Tremblay and Awad, those being: vicarious infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unfair competition, negligence, and unjust enrichment. It is, however, prepared to fight the first claim of direct copyright infringement in hope of winning it to make a point to any other creative person considering pursuing it.\n\nOpenAI made the same argument against Silverman et al's federal lawsuit, too, for what it's worth.\n\n\n\n\"This motion does not seek dismissal of Count I, for direct copyright infringement, which OpenAI will seek to resolve as a matter of law at a later stage of the case,\" the lab's legal eagles argued in court filings [PDF]. The lawyers believe most of the plaintiffs' accusations do not describe any actual law-breaking by OpenAI, and rest allegedly involve the biz directly infringing on the writers' intellectual property \u2013 allegations the organization denies. \n\nLawyers for the AI biz argued OpenAI has not violated copyright laws at all and that ChatGPT is protected under fair use. US copyright law states that \"transformative uses\" of work \u2013 where the original source is repurposed \u2013 is considered fair use. Although the large language model ingested the authors and comedian's books, it transformed their text for different applications. That's the argument, anyway. \n\n\"According to the complaints, every single ChatGPT output \u2013 from a simple response to a question (e.g., 'Yes'), to the name of the president of the United States, to a paragraph describing the plot, themes, and significance of Homer's The Iliad \u2013 is necessarily an infringing 'derivative work' of plaintiffs' books,\" they wrote in the court docs.\n\n\"Worse still, each of those outputs would simultaneously be an infringing derivative of each of the millions of other individual works contained in the training corpus \u2013 regardless of whether there are any similarities between the output and the training works. That is not how copyright law works,\" they concluded.\n\nAI and copyright is a contentious legal gray area. Similar lawsuits have been filed by visual artists, who claim companies like Stability AI have trained text-to-image models on their artwork. Although the US Copyright Office has declared that works which are \"not the product of human authorship\" cannot be protected, officials are unsure about other issues.\n\nThe office issued a request for public comment [PDF] this week on copyright law and policy issues raised by AI.\n\nThe Register has asked the plaintiffs' lawyers for comment.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"ORLANDO, Florida, Aug 24 (Reuters) - What if Japan or China intervened in the foreign exchange market to sell dollars and support their currencies and liquidated U.S. Treasuries in the process - and the sky didn't fall down?\n\nIt would be a scenario hard to imagine even 10 years ago, but it's more plausible now because the world's top two holders of U.S. debt no longer pack the Treasury market punch they once did - either individually or even together.\n\nThe Japanese and Chinese central banks' combined footprint in the world's largest, deepest and most liquid government bond market is now its lowest on record, at least since comparable data began being collected in the late 1990s.\n\nTheir combined $2 trillion pile in June, the last month official U.S. Treasury data is available, equated to 7.8% of the $25 trillion outstanding marketable U.S. Treasuries, less than a third of the record 25.4% registered in June 2007.\n\nJapan's official stash of $1.11 trillion represents 4.4% of the total market, also a record low, while China's $835 billion stash is around 3.4% of the total, the lowest in over 20 years. In contrast, the Federal Reserve holds $5 trillion, or 20% of the overall market.\n\nTo be sure, Japan and China are still forces to be reckoned with. They are by some distance the world's top two holders of U.S. bonds, and China's stash is probably significantly larger when state banks, wealth funds and suspected holdings in third-party countries like Belgium and Britain are factored in.\n\nBut they don't bestride the Treasuries market like they once did, nor does the threat of them selling strike the same fear into bond investors, global markets at large, and even policymakers in Washington.\n\nThat wasn't the case in years gone by, certainly in the 2000s before the global financial crisis when Japan, oil exporters and emerging countries - especially China - recycled their huge trade surpluses into U.S. Treasuries to build up formidable foreign exchange reserves.\n\n\"No foreign central bank owns the bond market, so to speak. The market is basically driven by a set of bets on the Fed, not flows from any one country these days,\" said Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations.\n\nJapan and China were both buyers of Treasuries in June, the last month of available data. Valuation-adjusted data from Fed economists Carol Bertaut and Ruth Judson show that China and Japan added $8 billion and $6 billion to their respective stashes.\n\nChina's Treasuries holdings fell a valuation-adjusted $34 billion in the first half of the year, although its U.S. agency debt holdings rose nearly $20 billion. Japan's Treasuries stash increased by $40 billion while its agencies pile fell by $25 billion.\n\nForeign central banks' total stockpile of Treasuries rose $26.5 billion to $3.54 trillion in June, and by almost $100 billion in the first half of the year, Judson and Bertaut's figures show.\n\nThis ties in with official sector holdings of U.S. Treasuries parked with the Fed, which are up around $100 billion this year.\n\nThat's a lot, but nowhere near keeping pace with the increase in supply. The Fed continues to reduce its holdings by $60 billion a month, and U.S. Treasury issuance is exploding.\n\nJapanese yen near 50-year low\nReuters Image Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nChinese yuan at 10-year low\nReuters Image Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWith U.S. bond yields at their highest since the late 2000s, the widening yield gap is pushing the yuan and yen to historically low levels against the dollar. The yen's real effective exchange rate, or REER, is also near its lowest in 50 years, and the yuan's REER value is the lowest in a decade.\n\nSpeculation is rising that Beijing or Tokyo could soon dip into their Treasuries holdings to fund dollar-selling intervention in the currency market.\n\nTokyo is more likely to take the plunge, as it did last September and October. Its rounds of yen-supporting interventions were worth a record $60 billion and funded mostly via U.S. T-bills or short-dated bonds.\n\nChinese state-run banks, meanwhile, are mopping up excess yuan to keep the exchange rate \"basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level\" and Beijing has other liquidity-boosting and exchange rate-management tools to steady the currency without selling Treasuries.\n\nAt least for now.\n\n\"We do not yet see signs of Treasury sales for intervention purposes, but further dollar appreciation particularly vs the yuan and yen pose risks,\" Bank of America strategists wrote last week.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)\n\nReporting by Jamie McGeever; editing by Jonathan Oatis","labels":["geopolitical_issues","investments"]}

By market close the company\u2019s stock price had recovered slightly to $40.69, a decline of 13.6 per cent on the day.\n\nCEO Tobi L\u00fctke said in a letter to employees made public Tuesday that the company made a bet that the global retail transition to e-commerce, which picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would continue to accelerate.\n\nThe Ottawa-based company, which backs digital storefronts and provides a variety of e-commerce services to its \u201cmillions\u201d of merchants, had scaled up its workforce to meet the demand it projected, L\u00fctke wrote.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, Shopify said it had more than 5,000 employees; as of Tuesday it said it has more than 10,000 without accounting for the layoffs. That means the company effectively doubled its headcount over the course of the pandemic.\n\nShopify was the country\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company for much of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The supply chain constraints, especially in motor components, are also expected to weigh on production in the current quarter.\n\nOn Monday, Lordstown posted sales of three vehicles and said it incurred $30 million in cost of sales. But, it did not provide a production or delivery forecast for the electric pickup truck during a conference call with analysts.\n\n\"We will continue to execute a capital constrained business plan,\" CFO Adam Kroll said, adding that Lordstown will need to raise \"significantly more\" capital to cover costs related to developing its new vehicle.\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $102.3 million, compared with $81.2 million a year earlier. The results included an impairment charge of $36.5 million that the firm said was driven mainly by a decrease in its stock price.\n\nThe company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $221.7 million and it expects to have between $150 million and $170 million in cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter.\n\nLordstown also reiterated doubt in its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe firm's revenue of $194,000, widely missed estimates of $1.29 million, while its adjusted loss was larger than expected.","labels":["supplychain"]}

It is part of an event series launched in partnership with Greenprint Hub, an initiative designed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore\u2019s central bank, to help grow the country\u2019s environmental, social and governance (ESG) fintech space. \n\nFor now, the roles of finance and investment professionals are being \u201crepurposed\u201d and given an \u201can extra ESG hat\u201d to integrate ESG into their applications, which Chidambaram said is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d in the long run.\n\nGreenprint Hub_Rochester Commons_ESG skills gap\nSpeakers at the Greenprint Hub conversation series included (from right) Ravi Chidambaram, founder of software-as-a-service start-up RIMM Sustainability, and Paddy Balfour, Asia director for sustainable recruitment firm Acre.

{"text":"The 2008 financial crisis in the US kicked off a debt supercycle, which spread to Europe in 2010 and has recently engulfed many of the world\u2019s low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Could the debt woes of Country Garden, the behemoth Chinese real estate developer now facing billions of dollars in losses, augur the cycle\u2019s next turn?\n\nThe answer remains unclear. While the Chinese authorities have a remarkable track record when it comes to containing economic crises, the challenges posed by a significant growth slowdown, combined with high debt levels \u2013 especially for local governments and the property sector \u2013 are unprecedented.\n\nChina\u2019s current problems can be traced back to its massive post-2008 investment stimulus, a significant portion of which fuelled the real estate construction boom. After years of building housing and offices at breakneck speed, the bloated property sector \u2013 which accounts for 23% of the country\u2019s GDP (26% counting imports) \u2013 is now yielding diminishing returns. This comes as little surprise, as China\u2019s housing stock and infrastructure rival that of many advanced economies while its per capita income remains comparatively low.\n\nIs the era of zero interest rates gone for good?\nJeffrey Frankel\nRead more\nAt the same time, in what had once seemed like a race between a tortoise and a hare, the US is speeding toward artificial intelligence-powered technological innovation and higher long-term economic growth. As the highly respected Wall Street Journal economics commentator Greg Ip recently put it, \u201cNo one talks about secular stagnation now,\u201d referring to a theory that a chronic deficiency in global demand and economically important innovation will hold down growth and real interest rates long into the future.\n\nFunnily enough, I said much the same at a conference seven years ago. In my presentation, which was based on my 2015 paper debt supercycle, not secular stagnation, I explained that post-crisis malaise was typical and would at least partly fade. I then conjectured: \u201cIn nine years, nobody will be talking about secular stagnation\u201d \u2013 a perhaps hyperbolic remark to underscore the point. (I am grateful that one of my co-panellists, J Bradford Delong, quoted me on his blog, perhaps forgetting that the conference was held under Chatham House rules.)\n\nMy greatest concern has never been an end to innovation but that the rise of AI will outpace our ability to control it\nOver the past decade, the overwhelming consensus in academic and policy circles has been that the world is deeply mired in an era of ultra-low interest rates driven by weak growth fundamentals. And in fact, it remains so today. For example, the Northwestern University economist Robert J Gordon\u2019s magisterial history The Rise and Fall of American Growth offers persuasive arguments for the death of innovation and the end of growth. Gordon posits that post-1970s inventions \u2013 even the computer revolution \u2013 are not nearly as economically important as, say, the steam engine or electricity generation.\n\n\nThe billionaire investor Peter Thiel and the former world chess champion Garry Kasparov made similar arguments in a 2012 debate on the topic of \u201cinnovation or stagnation\u201d at the University of Oxford. Arguing on the \u201cinnovation\u201d side of that debate, I pointed to advances in chess that heralded the coming of an AI age, while also noting that commercial innovation invariably stalls at times, for example during the Great Depression. In fact, my greatest concern has never been an end to innovation but rather that the rise of AI will outpace our ability to control it.\n\nThere are strong arguments for secular stagnation on the demand side, owing to demographic decline. In a brilliant 2013 speech, the Harvard economist Lawrence H Summers argued that only a continuing shortfall in global demand could explain the era\u2019s ultra-low interest rates, triggering an avalanche of research on fundamentals that could explain the demand deficiency. Progressive politicians have used this work to make the case that bigger government is needed to fill the void. Summers, however, was more circumspect, advocating increased investment in infrastructure and education, and outright transfers from rich to poor \u2013 ideas with which I strongly agree.\n\nBut despite some good arguments for secular stagnation, concerns about sustained slower growth are overblown. Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan have challenged the view that demographic decline inevitably lowers demand by pointing to the rapidly growing elderly population.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\n\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, interest rates also fell to zero during the Great Depression and stayed there \u2013 until they didn\u2019t. Notably, the rate on 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury bonds is currently well above its average level of about zero from 2012 to 2021.\n\nThe debt supercycle may have lasted longer than initially expected, perhaps because of the coronavirus pandemic. But it was a critical piece of the story, and now, as China\u2019s economy falters, it is the best explanation for what might come next.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Strong performances in Germany and the US have put Deutsche Telekom on a solid financial footing going into this year.\n\nThe German incumbent on Thursday said it expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDA AL) to grow to \u20ac40.8 billion this year, compared to pro forma EBITDA AL of \u20ac39.3 billion in 2022. It expects free cash flow after leases to grow by at least 40% to more than \u20ac16 billion.\n\nDT\u2019s upbeat outlook comes after it exceeded its guidance for 2022, with full-year revenue growing 6.1 percent year-on-year to \u20ac114.4 billion. It is no mean feat given DT raised its guidance multiple times last year, most recently in November, when it increased its EBITDA AL forecast to more than \u20ac37 billion from its previous target of around \u20ac37 billion. Not only that, but net profit almost doubled to \u20ac8 billion from \u20ac4.2 billion.\n\nDT capped off 2022 with a strong fourth quarter, as group revenue grew 4% to \u20ac29.8 billion, and EBITDA AL jumped 10.6% to \u20ac9.96 billion from \u20ac9.01 billion.\n\nAs per usual, the telco\u2019s domestic and US operations gave the standout performances.\n\nIn Germany, DT added 225,000 postpaid mobile customers, driving mobile service revenue up by 3.5% compared to Q4 last year. It also added 372,000 fibre customers during the quarter, increasing its overall broadband based by 74,000. As a result, revenue in Germany grew slightly to \u20ac6.4 billion from \u20ac6.3 billion, while earnings increased 2.9% to \u20ac2.5 billion.\n\nT-Mobile US\u2019 latest results have already been covered, but when it comes to their impact on its parent, it seems the strength of the dollar was the biggest factor. DT\u2019s US arm turned over \u20ac19.8 billion in Q4, up 8.3% on the prior year. However, in dollars, revenue was actually down 3.3% to $20.2 billion.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile US is systematically scaling back the terminal equipment lease business for its customers, which was taken over as part of the business combination with Sprint. This has a reducing effect on total revenue,\u201d Deutsche Telekom explained in its earnings report. Q4 service revenue at T-Mobile US grew to \u20ac15.2 billion from \u20ac12.8 billion.\n\nThe US and Germany helped to offset a lacklustre year in Europe, which saw revenue fall 1.2% to \u20ac11.2 billion. In Q4, revenue came in at \u20ac2.9 billion, flat compared to last year. Full-year EBITDA AL inched down to \u20ac3.9 billion from \u20ac4 billion, and in Q4 it fell to \u20ac956 million from \u20ac962 million.\n\n\u201cThe upheavals in the world, and their consequences, are not without their effects on Deutsche Telekom,\u201d said chairman and CEO Tim H\u00f6ttges, in a very brief statement. \u201cBut by continuing to execute our strategy, we were nevertheless able to meet all of our targets in 2022.\u201d","labels":["investments"]}

{"text":"GE, GM, Boeing and Ford among companies listing China risk\nGeopolitical risk is a top concern for supply chains, study says\nCompanies including General Electric Co., Boeing Co., and Nike Inc. are wading through a mounting pile of concerns about their China-linked supply chains as geopolitical troubles brew and pressure to cut ties ramps up from the US government and investors.\n\nGeopolitical risk is rising as recent tensions between China and Taiwan add to companies\u2019 long lists of supply chain worries. There\u2019s a hangover from the Covid pandemic and shutdowns in China, tariffs on Chinese imports, sanctions on Chinese businesses, and a new US human rights law targeting forced labor in China, lawyers and supply chain experts say. And it\u2019s all happening as the Biden administration and Congress\u2014continually hawkish on China as an economic and national security threat\u2014hope to incentivize manufacturing closer to home.\n\nGE, Boeing, and automakers General Motors Co, and Ford Motor Co. are among the companies disclosing in financial filings how US-China frictions pose business risks. There\u2019s also pressure from investors. Walt Disney Co., Apple Inc, Starbucks Corp. and Boeing faced China-related shareholder proposals in recent weeks, asking the companies to weigh the reputational risk of doing business in the country.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mountain of risk that continues to get larger,\u201d said Lisa Anderson, a supply chain expert at LMA Consulting.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the newly-formed Select Committee on China sent warning shots to companies including Nike and Adidas AG earlier in May, pressing them on how they avoid using goods made with forced labor in China. The new bipartisan committee has promised to \u201crestore supply chains and end critical economic dependencies on China.\u201d\n\nSome companies are shifting where they make their products or source their materials. Apple, for example, is planning to move more of its iPhone production from China to India. But the process of revamping supply chains that took years or even decades to build can be both time consuming and costly, lawyers and consultants say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very challenging because, first of all, supply chains are created over many years,\u201d said Carl Valenstein, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. \u201cPeople think you can easily change your supply chain\u2014you can\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\n\u2018Unique Risks\u2019\nCompanies with significant business tied to China are putting investors on notice about the continued or increasing risks.\n\nGE\u2019s April quarterly 10-Q filing noted the risks imposed by \u201can escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions between the US and China or other countries, and related impacts on our businesses\u2019 global supply chains and strategies.\u201d Boeing, in an April 10-Q filing, said that \u201cthe current state of US-China relations remains an ongoing watch item,\u201d noting the dueling US and China import tariffs on airplane parts and components.\n\nThe automotive industry, especially, is on alert. Ford said in a February filing that \u201cChina presents unique risks to US automakers due to the strain in US-China relations, China\u2019s unique regulatory landscape, and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain.\u201d And GM pointed out in its January annual report that \u201ccontinued US-China trade tensions\u201d among other factors could impact its business.\n\nBoeing declined to comment. GM and GE didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment. A Ford spokesperson downplayed the unique risk posed by the company\u2019s China operations\u2014at least in comparison to other risks that investors need to know about.\n\n\u201cFederal law requires us to disclose material factors\u2014including everything from pandemic conditions to geopolitical factors\u2014that could introduce risk to our business operations,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt is common\u2014and expected\u2014for multinational companies to do this, including other global automakers.\u201d\n\nA number of companies frequently reference the hit their supply chain\u2019s production took from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns in China.\n\n\u201cCovid made it quite brutally visible that having an undiversified supply chain meant losing market share at lightning speed,\u201d said Gregor St\u00fchler, CEO of supply chain AI platform Scoutbee.\n\nIntelligence Warning\nThen there\u2019s the specter of China potentially invading Taiwan, and the US sanctions that would surely follow.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big fear,\u201d Valenstein said, noting that an invasion of Taiwan would be far more disruptive on US supply chains than Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has been, because of how intertwined the US and Chinese economies are.\n\nThe US intelligence community has voiced its supply chain fears. The most recent annual threat assessment, published in February, laid out the US worries that China\u2019s dominance in the tech, semiconductor, battery, solar panel and pharmaceutical sectors \u201ccould pose a significant risk to US and Western manufacturing and consumer sectors if the government of China was able to adeptly leverage its dominance for political or economic gain.\u201d\n\nThe data back up just how many companies are mulling such concerns. A KPMG survey of 132 companies on Asian Pacific sourcing moves said 23% of supply chain shifts were prompted by geopolitical risk. The March report lists Vietnam, Taiwan, the US, Mexico and India among some of the top destinations for such shifts from China between 2018 and 2023.\n\n\u201cThe costs have become so significant that it\u2019s not a surprise to see efforts, slow though they may be, to shift away from China,\u201d said Ryan Fayhee, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed who previously worked at the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division.\n\nSupply chain experts say there\u2019s been an increase in clients mulling potential manufacturing or sourcing shifts, but much depends on the industry. The solar panel market has made a \u201cremarkable shift\u201d out of China, Valenstein said, but the life sciences industry \u201cis not going to abandon\u201d the Chinese market.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to boost US manufacturing, for example through incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act to encourage domestic sourcing of components and critical minerals for EV batteries. While China dominates the EV battery supply chain, Ford and Tesla have plans to build new battery plants in the US.\n\nFor many other companies, though, \u201ccutting China out of their supply chain is not realistic\u2014at least in the short or medium term,\u201d said Richard Mojica, a partner at Miller & Chevalier.\n\nNike, Adidas Pressed\nThere are also human rights concerns about sourcing materials in China. A new US human rights law targeting Chinese goods made with forced labor, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, assumes that any product made with goods even partially sourced from the Xinjiang region of China has been made with forced labor\u2014unless a company can prove otherwise.\n\n\u201cOne of the key concerns and challenges among numerous industries right now is the need to trace their supply chains and map them way back to the Nth degree,\u201d Mojica said, explaining that the broad swathe of government scrutiny is driving a lot of these assessments. \u201cThat is a humongous challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new law, which took effect in June, has caught some companies off guard. US Customs says on its website that it has denied 490 shipments into the country to date under the law; 291 of those were from apparel, footwear and textiles companies.\n\nLawmakers this month pressed Nike, Adidas, and Chinese-based shopping platforms Shein and Temu, questioning them in public letters about how they avoid using goods made with forced labor. The letter to Nike, for example, asks the retailer for a \u201cdetailed description\u201d of the steps it\u2019s taken since the UFLPA took effect\u2014to examine its supply chain, if its contractually obligated its garment suppliers to ensure that no materials from Xinjiang are used in clothes to be sold in the US, and what audit methods it uses to verify that suppliers in China are not exploiting Uyghurs.\n\nThe companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The lawmakers are warning businesses to make changes now: Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, encouraged companies at an April hearing to \u201cscour their supply chains.\u201d\n\n\nProxy Action\nShareholders have also pointed to forced labor concerns and the worsening US-China relationship during annual meetings.\n\nRecent resolutions at Apple, Disney, Starbucks, and Boeing were brought by the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative shareholder proponent. The group asked the companies to look into potential risks to their reputations and other areas of operating in China. While the proposals typically received less than 10% of support, Paul Chesser, who has presented the proposals for the group, said in an interview that he believes \u201cthis is an issue for which those on the left and right can come together.\u201d\n\nA March report on the 2023 proxy season from environmental, social and governance proponents strikes a similar bipartisan sentiment. The report from shareholder advocate As You Sow, partnered with the Sustainable Investments Institute and Proxy Impact, said concern about corporate ties to the Chinese Communist Party is \u201ca shared concern with progressive groups.\u201d\n\nCompanies have mainly argued that they already report on such risks. Boeing said in the proxy statement for its April annual meeting that \u201csingling out particular countries or groups of customers for scrutiny would be misleading to shareholders and potentially damage our relationships with customers, suppliers, and regulators.\u201d\n\nWhile at least some corporate boards are finding their China operations a growing area of concern and alerting investors, most companies still aren\u2019t completely ready to pull the plug, supply chain experts say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly movement but it\u2019s strategic and it can be piecemeal,\u201d Mojica said. \u201cThere\u2019s not this rush to get out of China.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Clara Hudson in Washington at chudson@bloombergindustry.com\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeff Harrington at jharrington@bloombergindustry.com; Michael Ferullo at mferullo@bloomberglaw.com\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"This year, hotel sales experienced a steep decline statewide, according to Atlas Hospitality Group, which recently released its midyear 2023 California sales report. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a record number decline,\u201d said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, who\u2019s been tracking California hotel sales for more than 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of percentage drop.\u201d\n\nStatewide, sales decreased 53% during the first half of the year.\n\nReay said he sees numerous similarities between now and 2009. \n\nBut, what\u2019s even more interesting about this year\u2019s dramatic decline in sales is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily square with how hotels are doing, a marked contrast with 2009, when the U.S. was coming out of the Great Recession.\n\n\nMost hotels \u2013 specifically in Southern California \u2013 have recovered from all the residual impacts of Covid-19 in terms of an operational standpoint, with revenue and occupancy rates having generally returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cThe big cause of this decline is the rapid increase in interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cThe one word that would sum it up is \u2018disconnect.\u2019\u201d\n\nReay said the disconnect exists between the expectations of buyers and sellers \u2013 the prices that sellers are looking for are just not comparable with the cost buyers must pay for loans.\n\nThis has resulted in an uptick in the notice of default filings and foreclosures, as well as borrowers simply handing keys back to their lenders.\n\n\u201cI would call this an interest rate-driven downturn,\u201d Reay said, noting that despite numerous similarities to 2009, we are not in a recession now because the operational side of the hotel industry is performing relatively well. \n\nLos Angeles hotel sales\n\nIn Los Angeles County, only 17 hotels were sold in the first six months of the year compared to 36 in the same period last year. That\u2019s a decline of 53%, the same percentage drop as the state.\n\nLikewise, of those transactions, the number of rooms that sold last year was 2,894, as opposed to the 1,315 in the first six months of this year, a 55% decrease. Also, the median price per room declined by 13% this year.\n\nYet, last year the total sales price was $808,259,906, whereas this year the total sales price was $1,008,790,000, a 25% increase. \n\nIn addition, the average price per room this year is up 16% year over year, further illustrating the disconnect between the expectations of buyers and sellers. \n\nAnd beyond high interest rates, Measure ULA \u2013 the one-time real estate transfer tax unique to L.A. city properties valued at or above $5 million that went into effect on April 1 \u2013 has hit the L.A. hotel scene hard, with many owners delaying selling.\n\nIn the second quarter of last year, L.A. experienced 20 hotel sales priced above $5 million. In that same period this year, the only hotel sale the city of L.A. had above $5 million was the $760 million foreclosure sale of the Fairmont Century Plaza, a 394-room luxury hotel located in Century City, by the Reuben Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhat you have unique to Los Angeles is not only this huge decline in sales because of interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s compounded by the fact that you now have the mansion tax and owners are really holding off on selling.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reay, as long as interest rates remain at their current levels there will be more pressure on sellers and lenders to adjust their price expectations downward.

{"text":"Horizon Blockchain Bridge Latest Crypto Hack Victim, $100 Million Stolen\nSCOTT IKEDA\u00b7JUNE 30, 2022\nUnited States-based blockchain bridge Horizon, a service that links Ethereum with the Harmony decentralized blockchain platform, is the latest project to fall victim to a crypto hack.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe blockchain bridge was hit for about $100 million in cryptocurrency as the attackers potentially exploited a signature vulnerability that outside security researchers had been warning about on social media for months. Harmony has not yet released any information about the actual cause of the breach, and the Horizon bridge remains closed as the company remediates the issue.\n\nBlockchain bridge latest in string of high-dollar attacks on Ethereum services\nHarmony has multiple blockchain bridges to different types of currencies; the crypto hack appears to have only impacted the bridge to Ethereum, lending some credence to the theory that a proposed vulnerability circulating on Twitter since at least early April was exploited.\n\nWhile Harmony has yet to comment on exactly what caused the crypto hack, a June 23 tweet from the company fingered a wallet address that the hackers apparently used to process the stolen funds (made up of a variety of crypto asset types) and convert everything to Ethereum. A June 27 update from the company indicated that the hackers were moving the stolen funds through Tornado Cash to anonymize them and that Harmony was working with the FBI and two outside security firms in an investigation of the incident. The company has also offered a $1 million bounty with a promise of no criminal charges if the funds are returned.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Horizon blockchain bridge was closed on June 23 as part of this investigation and remains down as it proceeds. The company is issuing updates on the situation via Twitter.\n\nThe incident follows the biggest attack to date on a decentralized finance platform (and one of the largest overall crypto thefts in history), the March theft of $600 million from popular NFT game Axie Infinity. There has been something of a trend of attacks on defi services in the past year, with a growing perception that they have lax security and are open to both code-based exploits and social engineering approaches. A February attack on the Wormhole bridge netted $325 million in stolen funds; about $10 billion was stolen in crypto hacks of defi platforms in 2021, and some analysts project this number going up by at least several billion by the time 2022 comes to a close.\n\nDid the Horizon crypto hack stem from a vulnerability identified on Twitter?\nThe potential flaw in the blockchain bridge, articulated on Twitter by user \u201cApe Dev,\u201d points out that the entire system relies on a wallet that authorizes transactions that has four owners. Two of the four signers are all that is needed to authorize a transaction. The crypto hackers may have compromised two of these accounts through a variety of means such as obtaining private keys by breaching a hardware security module (HSM), or finding an exploit in the validation code. There is also always the possibility of it being an inside job, or the credentials to two of the necessary signature accounts being found in a breach elsewhere.\n\nDefi in general has become a popular target for crypto hacks due to a long string of security lapses, but blockchain bridges are of particular interest to attackers as they store substantial amounts of crypto token liquidity to facilitate the cross chain transfers of funds. Attackers can tap directly into these funds and abscond quickly, as happened in this case.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe string of defi crypto hacks in recent months has cast a light on fundamental security shortcomings of the entire enterprise. These platforms are not subject to regulations, do not have to provide transparency to users about how funds and protocols are secured, and are not really held to exacting security standards by anything other than the possibility of losing a large amount of money to a breach. Defi platforms that fall victim to a hack or scam are often reduced to offering a \u201cbounty\u201d of the sort that Harmony is offering to recover the stolen funds, a strategy that has proven to rarely work.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHarmony\u2019s own ONE token dropped 12% in the immediate wake of news of the breach, and has continued on a slight downward trend since. The token had already been struggling with the general crash in crypto of recent months, currently down to $0.0228 from a peak value of 0.38 in early January.\n\n#Blockchain bridge was hit for about $100M in #crypto hack as attackers potentially exploited a signature vulnerability that #security researchers had been warning about on Twitter for months. #respectdata\nClick to Tweet\nBlockchain bridges will almost certainly remain popular targets for crypto hackers until, at minimum, the industry moves to better standard trustless models and invites reputable third party security audits. Nick Percoco, Chief Security Officer of Kraken, expands on what will be needed going forward if defi platforms are to shake their reputation as a risky place to park funds and assets: \u201cHigh profile attacks, such as this one, continue to reinforce the importance of the broader crypto ecosystem prioritizing a security-first mindset and remaining vigilant. Criminals constantly search for new attack vectors and vulnerabilities, which means that security protocols need to be consistently invested in and updated. We anticipate the spotlight on this event will focus the minds of cyber security teams across the blockchain ecosystem and will result in more robust protocols moving forward.\u201d\n\n \n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"Apple has started to gradually decouple from China to mitigate the geopolitical risks.\nIt\u2019s too soon to talk about a full decoupling, but the latest developments indicate that Apple is unlikely to stop diversifying its supply chains anytime soon.\nAs globalization unravels, this article highlights the challenges that Apple could face as it tries to avoid becoming the next casualty of the possible upcoming Sino-American confrontation.\n\nEven though Tim Cook has been publicly praising the CCP in the past, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) even restricted the use of Airdrop during the recent protests of Chinese citizens against Beijing, behind the scenes the company's management is actively diversifying the supply chains in order to mitigate the risks of relying too much on China as globalization unravels. Back in July, I wrote an article on Apple in which I highlighted the company's vulnerabilities in China and how Beijing is using some of them to leverage its relationship with the most valuable company in the world and the U.S. in particular.\n\nSince that time, Apple has undertaken several notable relocations, which could help it to ease some of the risks. First of all, the company has expanded its presence in Vietnam, and India, and continues to look for new partners in the Southeast Asian region where it could utilize low-wage labor to ensure that its margins are not severely affected when moving some of the supply chains to new countries.\n\nSecondly, Tim Cook's recent statement inside the new chip factory of Taiwanese company TSMC (TSM) in Arizona about the production of Apple-designed chips there starting from 2024 also makes it possible for the company to mitigate risks that are associated with Beijing's potential invasion of Taiwan in the future.\n\nWhile it's too soon to talk about full decoupling from China, as Apple continues to heavily rely on production within the country to this day, the latest developments indicate that the company is finally taking the threats that come from China seriously. Even though investors could see some of the company's costs rising in the foreseeable future, the diversification of supply chains ensures that Apple is able to survive and thrive in case of a further confrontation between Beijing and Washington.\n\nAs Apple diversifies, this article aims at highlighting the potential challenges that the company could face and how it could affect its performance in years to come.\n\nThe New Geopolitical Reality\nIn the last two years, Apple has been slowly decreasing its reliance on China. If in 2020, the company's exposure to the country's supply chains was 42%, then in 2021 that percentage decreased to 35.9%. Even though that's not enough to mitigate any major geopolitical disruptions, even such a decrease indicates that the company's management and Tim Cook in particular, who started building the existing supply chains during the Steve Jobs era, understands that it's no longer safe to over-rely on China in our current day and age no more.\n\nOne of the reasons for that is the inability to predict the direction in which Beijing will take the country. In one of my articles on Alibaba (BABA), I've already explained how the sacking of market reformists from the Standing Committee along with Xi Jinping, who has been reelected for an unprecedented third term as the General Secretary of the CCP, against the West makes China an unreliable partner for foreigners. Add to this the fact that the latest decision of the Biden administration to apply new export controls on advanced chips to China and a subsequent decision of Beijing to request opening a panel at the WTO against the U.S. have reignited the ongoing trade war and it becomes obvious that the improvement of Sino-American relations won't happen anytime soon. We already see that the U.S. manufacturing orders from China are now down 40%, which is a sign that things won't return to what we know as normal anytime soon.\n\nThe good news is that it appears that Apple is on its way to mitigating some of the risks of Beijing's foreign and domestic policy at the same time. Considering that there's constantly a possibility that Beijing decides to invade Taiwan by the end of this decade, it made sense for Apple's foundry partner TSMC to start building a plant in a safe location such as Arizona where the disruptions to its production of chips would be minimal. The appearance of Tim Cook along with President Biden earlier this month during the 'tool-in' ceremony of the upcoming TSMC plant in Arizona and the announcement of the production of Apple's chips on American soil starting in 2024 is a good way to ensure that the company's advanced chips won't be hostages to Beijing's foreign policy in the future.\n\nAt the same time, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that after the latest protests against the zero-Covid policy in Zhengzhou, which primarily affected the production of iPhones, Apple accelerated the process of looking for ways to outsource its production to other countries such as India and Vietnam. While the process is still ongoing, the analysts at JPMorgan (JPM) believe that by 2025 every fourth iPhone will be made in India, which is a sign that Apple started to take the risks of overexposing the production to a single country more seriously in recent months and finally is moving in the right direction after years of complacency.\n\nThe biggest upside in all of this is that with close to $50 billion in cash reserves and a decent debt profile, Apple could afford to move its production to other countries, which can't be said the same about other smaller businesses that are in the same position as the Cupertino-based tech giant.\n\nThe Upcoming Challenges\nWhile it makes sense for Apple to decrease its overexposure to China and mitigate some of the geopolitical risks, the company nevertheless is unlikely to fully decouple from the country anytime soon. The first major reason for it is the fact that China has become its third biggest consumer market after the Americas and Europe. Out of the $394.3 billion in net sales that Apple generated in FY22, $74.2 billion came from China. A potential loss of such a big consumer market in case of a potential direct confrontation between Beijing and Washington is certainly going to hurt.\n\nConsidering that the Pentagon in its latest National Security Strategy report noted that China is the only competitor that has the intent and capacity to reshape the global order, it becomes obvious that a potential direct confrontation in the future is more than possible whether we or Apple like it or not.\n\nHowever, even if we assume that the worst that could happen is simply a major decoupling of China and the U.S. from each other, Apple would nevertheless is more than likely to take a major financial hit even from such an outcome.\n\nOne of the main reasons for it is the fact that there's no guarantee that Apple would be able to keep its margins and expenses at the current levels if it outsources most of its production to other countries. A few years ago, a Chinese expert Doug Guthrie, who has been hired by Apple to help the company navigate within China, came to the conclusion that neither India nor Vietnam are viable replacements due to a bureaucracy that made it complicated to build infrastructure and production plants.\n\nIt's been a few years since he came to such a conclusion, so there's a chance that things have improved and Apple nevertheless manages to relocate the production without significantly hurting its margins or increasing its expenses. However, what we do know though is that it's more than likely that Apple would continue to postpone the release of future products such as its own electric car until it mitigates a significant portion of the geopolitical risks.\n\nAnother problem that the company is facing is the inability to significantly accelerate the outsourcing of production to other countries. Bloomberg estimates that it would take 8 years to outsource only 10% of its production capacity, which is likely to be too late for it to avoid becoming a casualty of a possible upcoming economic Sino-American confrontation, as a potential escalation of the ongoing trade war would more than likely impact its revenues and inflate the costs.\n\nLet's not forget that back in 2019, Apple managed to dodge some of the tariffs only due to the trade agreement between China and the U.S., which nevertheless hasn't fully ended a trade war at that time. With Sino-American relations being at historically low levels, the possibility of having a similar agreement in case of further escalation remains dim.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it becomes clear that Apple is more than likely to face tough following years as it tries to mitigate all the geopolitical risks at once. To figure out whether Apple's shares have any upside given the latest developments, I've updated my DCF model, which could be seen below.\n\nIn the base case scenario, the top-line growth assumptions are in-line with the street estimates, while most other assumptions are either averages of previous years or in-line with the latest reported period. As for the change in net working capital, it represents only 1% of revenues in the following years solely due to the fact that in previous years it fluctuated much and can't be fully predicted going forward. The terminal growth rate in the model remained at 3%, while WACC has been increased to 8.5% due to the rising interest rates.\n\nThe model shows that under normal conditions, Apple's implied fair value is $126.73 per share, which represents a downside from the current levels. While such a price is below the consensus price of $172.51 per share, it's nevertheless above the lowest street price target of $118 per share. At the same time, Seeking Alpha's Quant system gives Apple an F rating for valuation.\n\nConsidering that this is a base case scenario where Apple's operations are not disrupted, it's safe to say that any downsides that come with the relocation of production or any risks that could materialize due to Beijing's domestic or foreign policy have all the chances to negatively affect the company's valuation even more.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nIn the last couple of decades, Apple has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalization, as the high-tech chip designs of Silicon Valley coupled with the low-wage labor of China made it possible for the company to disrupt several industries, enrich its shareholders, and become the most valuable company in the world along the way. As globalization unravels, Apple is racing against time to decrease its exposure from China in order to mitigate any major geopolitical risks, secure its supply chains, and ensure its own survival in case the relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate even more and lead to a potential direct confrontation in the future.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Apple would succeed in its endeavor, as the decoupling from China creates not only opportunities but its own challenges as well. However, there's no doubt that the sooner Apple stops over-relying on a single party, the better the chances that it would be able to stay afloat and not be too exposed to the changing geopolitical landscape.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}
{"text":"Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have agreed to extend their merger agreement pending the outcome of negotiations with UK regulators. Both parties will now have until October 18th to finalize the transaction, after missing yesterday\u2019s original deal deadline.\n\n\u201cThe recent decision in the US and approvals in 40 countries all validate that the deal is good for competition, players, and the future of gaming,\u201d tweeted Lulu Cheng Meservey, Activision Blizzard\u2019s CCO and EVP of corporate affairs. \u201cGiven global regulatory approvals and the companies\u2019 confidence that CMA now recognizes there are remedies available to meet their concerns in the UK, the Activision Blizzard and Microsoft boards of directors have authorized the companies not to terminate the deal until after October 18.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft vice chair and president Brad Smith says the three-month extension is designed \u201cto provide ample time to work through the final regulatory issues.\u201d\n\nBoth Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have also agreed to a higher termination fee and new commercial arrangements for the transaction. A termination fee, payable if Microsoft or Activision walks away from the deal, is now set at $3.5 billion if the deal doesn\u2019t close by August 29th, and it jumps to $4.5 billion if September 15th passes without a finalization.\n\nActivision has also agreed to potentially \u201chold separate the Company or certain assets of the Company or to implement other lawful alternatives to consummate the Merger\u201d with UK regulators. This is a key part, as it may allow the merger to go ahead with restrictions from the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nThis three-month delay is related to Microsoft\u2019s ongoing negotiations with the CMA. The UK regulator originally blocked the deal over cloud gaming concerns earlier this year. While Microsoft has appealed that decision, the company is also preparing to reportedly offer a new proposal to sell off its rights to cloud gaming in the UK to try and get the deal over the line.\n\nThe merger extension comes after a case management conference in the UK on Monday, where the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) agreed to allow Microsoft and CMA to negotiate a way to close the deal and pause the appeal process. The CMA made it clear earlier this week that Microsoft had not yet submitted its final proposal, and the regulator now has until Thursday at midday to file all the relevant evidence to the CAT for the tribunal judges to officially put the pause of the appeal in place.\n\nMicrosoft had originally planned to close its Activision Blizzard deal by July 18th, but the complex situation in the UK has added some extra time to the process. While there is plenty of regulatory work to do in the UK to analyze a change to the transaction, Microsoft is extending its deal deadline date to avoid it falling through if Activision Blizzard decided to walk away or the unlikely scenario of another company attempting to offer better terms for an acquisition.\n\nReading between the lines it looks like Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are aiming for a lot sooner than October 18th. The CMA also said last week that it will now issue a final order by August 29th, and Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have agreed an termination fee increase to $3.5 billion for that same date. That suggests there\u2019s a realistic prospect of Microsoft\u2019s proposal to the CMA being complete by August 29th, but the company has a lot longer should the regulator need to more fully investigate its changes to the terms of the deal.\n\nFinally, in an internal memo to Xbox employees, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d about the acquisition still being finalized:\n\nTeam,\n\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard remain optimistic that we will get our acquisition over the finish line, so we have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement to October 18, 2023. While we can technically close in the United States due to recent legal developments, this extension gives us additional time to resolve the remaining regulatory concerns in the UK.\n\nI want to thank everyone for your time and energy in support of the regulatory process and on all the great work coming to fruition for Xbox this year. Players around the world will be delighted with the incredible lineup of games launching in the next few months, including Starfield and Forza Motorsport. It is also great to see the fantastic work the ABK teams are delivering for their players with the successful launch of Diablo IV and the ongoing performance of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and we congratulate them on their accomplishments.\n\nAs we move even closer to the finish line, we are more excited than ever before about furthering our mission to bring more games to more players everywhere.\n\nPhil","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"The international air freight industry, also known as the air cargo industry, experienced record high rates in the spring of 2020. Typically, about 45 percent to 50 percent of air freight is transported in the bellies of passenger planes, but in April 2020, 75 percent of this air freight capacity was removed from the market due to a severe reduction in air travel.1 At the same time, personal protective equipment (PPE) was in enormous demand all over the world.2 Drastically reduced shipping capacity and urgent demand for PPE pushed prices up for air freight transportation services for goods being shipped from foreign countries into the United States, also known as U.S. inbound air freight, to unprecedented heights.\n\nThis Beyond the Numbers article looks back at pre-pandemic inbound air freight price trends in the United States and around the world and uses U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) price index measures to describe the COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in the market since early 2020.\n\nU.S. and worldwide trends\nIn 2019, 6.7 million air freight tons were shipped to the United States from foreign countries according to the Department of Transportation.3 Asia is the top source of U.S. inbound merchandise goods shipped via air. As seen in table 1, China contributed the most, with over 842,000 freight tons, followed by Hong Kong, which shipped just under 700,000 freight tons in 2019. Inbound air freight is carried by both domestic and foreign carriers. The value of air freight transportation services provided solely by foreign carriers destined for U.S. markets was $8.5 billion in 2019.4 The dollar value for the delivery services to the United States on foreign carriers was highest from South Korea at $1.1 billion, followed by China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan. When combined, these five countries accounted for 43.9 percent of the inbound freight ton total and 50.9 percent of the total dollar value of import air freight transportation services.\n\nTable 1. Top five U.S. import air freight transportation services trade partners by import dollar value and their inbound freight tons for 2019 \nCountry\tImport dollar value (in millions)\tInbound freight ton totals (in thousands)\nSouth Korea\n\nThe international air cargo market is a smaller share of cross-border trade than ocean cargo transported on freighters. Some international cargo is transported by air on cargo and passenger planes when shippers are willing to pay the high cost to quickly deliver the goods. Air cargo services are typically used for high-value and perishable items. Air cargo demand is cyclical and depends on various factors such as global economic activity, the business restocking cycle, and export orders.5 Worldwide, the international air freight industry experienced strong growth in 2017, with demand, measured in cargo ton kilometers, increasing almost 10 percent and total cargo revenue ton-miles increasing 12.9 percent.6 Starting in 2018, demand slowed to an increase of 3.6 percent, with a corresponding total cargo revenue ton-miles increasing 5.6 percent. The industry experienced some setbacks in 2019 because of economic decline related to international trade disputes. Demand fell 3.9 percent that year in response, the first decrease since 2012. Total revenue ton-miles declined 7.0 percent in 2019. International air freight capacity, measured in available cargo ton-kilometers, increased 3.9 percent in 2017, 5.3 percent in 2018, and 1.6 percent in 2019. Air freight rates typically increase in the fourth quarter each year due to the holiday demand and then taper off after the New Year.7 U.S. trends mirrored world trends; over the 2016\u201319 period, the December 12-month percent change of the Inbound Air Freight Price Index was 7.7 percent in 2017, 5.2 percent in 2018, and -6.6 percent in 2019.\n\nInbound prices ascended then descended\nInternational air freight price indexes published by BLS measure monthly price changes for transporting consolidated shipments and individual packages on flights arriving and departing the United States on both foreign carriers and U.S. carriers. Prices are collected for all areas of the world and account for both the direction of transport and residency of the companies providing and buying air freight services. Inbound air freight price indexes measure the monthly price changes of air freight flown from foreign countries into the United States on both U.S. and foreign carriers. Price indexes are available for all-world inbound air freight and for Asia and Europe, the two major trading regions beyond North America. Further details regarding the methodology of international air freight price indexes published by BLS can be found in the Air Freight Fact Sheet.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, inbound air freight price trends for the United States followed world trends. Looking at the regional impact (chart 1), we can see how a 39.8-percent increase in inbound Asian air freight prices drove the overall price index\u2019s advance from June 2016 to November 2018. Prices then declined over the subsequent 10-month period. Both Asian and European inbound air freight prices contributed to the fall, decreasing 14.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, from November 2018 to September 2019.\n\nChart 1. Inbound air freight price indexes, December 2015 to December 2020\nLine chart with 3 lines.\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories.\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying Index (Dec 2015 = 100). Data ranges from 88.2 to 190.9.\nEnd of interactive chart.\nView Chart Data\nInbound air freight prices began to increase in October 2019. They rose throughout the remainder of the year and into earlier 2020, capping off with record-breaking price advances in April and May. Before April, increases in the Inbound Air Freight Price Index for Asia offset relatively minor declines in the Inbound Air Freight Price Index for Europe. Inbound air freight prices then recorded increases of 23.6 percent from March to April and 18.7 percent from April to May, led by record-breaking advances in air freight prices from Asia. The rise in April was the largest 1-month advance since the price index was published on a monthly basis, and the increase in May was the second largest. The magnitude of the changes was caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPlanes grounded while demand takes off\nBeginning in March 2020, the international economy experienced widespread lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This affected the airline industry because airlines stopped flying passenger planes, especially those designated for international travel. Considering that almost half of air cargo is flown in the bellies of passenger planes, the airline industry decided to ground these planes, severely restricting the overall capacity of air freight. According to Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service, the number of commercial flights (including cargo flights) dropped from 81,309 on March 18, 2020, to 23,926 on April 12, 2020, an astounding 70.6 percent.8\n\nFrom March through May 2020, drastic changes in the air freight market affected both capacity and prices worldwide. Global capacity drastically reduced starting in March 2020. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that international capacity declined almost 25 percent year-over-year in March 2020 and continued to decline on a 12-month basis, decreasing 40.9 percent in April, 32.2 percent in May, 33.9 percent in June, and 32.9 percent in July.9 Global air freight demand declined drastically as well while manufacturing capabilities stalled around the world. In addition, the IATA reported that total capacity in April, including domestic and international, contracted 27.7 percent over the past year, the largest drop since the series was first published in 1990. When capacity declined, this sharp reduction caused cargo load factors, the capacity that is actually utilized, to rise; shippers used more of the available space\u2014planes were fuller. For example, the international Asia Pacific cargo load factor reached 72.1 percent for the year ended in April 2020, an increase of 14.4 percent from April 2019. A 42.5-percent decline in capacity over the same period more than offset a 28.1-percent drop in demand. The Europe region experienced similar capacity restraints and a demand decline. The advance in the Asia Pacific and Europe cargo load factors showcased not only the fall in capacity, but also the enormous need for cargo space to quickly transport PPE to the United States. In addition, daily freighter utilization, defined as average travel time per plane, was close to 11 hours a day, the highest level since IATA started publishing the data in 2012.  \n\nRestricted capacity and U.S. demand for PPE, which primarily came from Asia, contributed to U.S. inbound air freight prices spiking in April and May of 2020. As seen in table 2, the Inbound Air Freight Price Index increased 23.6 percent from March to April and 18.7 percent from April to May. Before April 2020, the largest 1-month advance was a 6.3-percent rise in July 2017. Both European and Asian inbound air freight prices contributed to the increase from March to April 2020, rising 25.2 percent and 27.8 percent, respectively. These advances were the largest 1-month increases since the price indexes were first published on a monthly basis in December 2005. Inbound air freight prices from Asia drove the rise in May, advancing 31.4 percent and setting a new monthly record, while inbound air freight prices from Europe fell 1.0 percent.\n\nTo cope with the sudden supply and demand changes, airlines around the world converted their passenger planes into cargo-only, either by securing shipments and packages onto their planes\u2019 seats or by removing the seats in order to make space for freight.10 By the end of April 2020, roughly 900 passenger planes were exclusively used for cargo transportation around the globe.11 On May 22, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an exemption allowing various U.S. airlines to secure freight on top of and under their planes\u2019 seats when no passengers were being transported.12 By mid-June, the total number of passenger planes used solely for cargo transportation increased to over 2,300.13 On July 10, another exemption was issued allowing airlines to remove seats and secure cargo using the now unused seat tracks.14 As of late August, nearly 2,500 passenger planes were used solely for freight-only flights.15\n\nThe new normal?\nInbound air freight prices fell after the April 2020 and May 2020 increases, declining 2.5 percent from May to June and 9.9 percent from June to July. Despite the monthly decreases, the effects of the price shocks continued to linger. Before April 2020, the largest 12-month advance was a 21.8-percent increase from July 2007 to July 2008. The over-the-year increases recorded from March 2020 to March 2021 all exceeded the July 2008 12-month advance, including a 47.2-percent rise from May 2019 to May 2020, the new high-water mark. While prices remained elevated, strong pre-holiday demand for the months leading into December contributed to 1-month advances in the Inbound Air Freight Price Index which rose 3.0 percent in October 2020 and 6.3 percent in November 2020. Coinciding with the end of the seasonal demand was the beginning of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, further straining available air cargo capacity.16 Inbound air freight prices had a 1-month advance of 6.5 percent in December 2020.\n\nVaccine distribution continues to be a demand factor for air freight transporters to consider throughout 2021. Also, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and improving conditions for the global economy are all affecting air freight prices.17 Although inbound air freight prices declined between December 2020 and March 2021, the price index remains high. Until passenger planes are flying internationally again, the current situation is likely to be the new normal.18\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

She will become chief investment officer and president starting Sept. 1 and lead 2024 planning while her successor is sought.\n\nPorat was hired from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), where she was finance chief. In her new role, she will oversee the company\u2019s so-called Other Bets portfolio, the unit for more risky hardware and services ventures, as well as help manage the company\u2019s global investments.\n\nAdvertisers, who make up a big share of Alphabet's revenue, have pulled back on spending precious dollars on untested platforms, helping the Google parent as well as Facebook owner Meta Platforms.\n\nBut Alphabet's second-quarter results are sure to please investors concerned over a broader advertiser pullback following the meteoric growth of Web services during the pandemic, as consumers returned to physical retail.\n\nSilicon Valley has been buzzing over generative artificial intelligence software that can give long-winded responses to user queries and is predicted to be the next leap forward for Big Tech. Alphabet rolled out AI products at its annual I\/O developer conference in May and it revamped its search engine to include generative AI.\n\nThe new AI technology comes at a cost: the largest component of Alphabet's second-quarter capital spending was for servers and a \"meaningful investment\" in AI computing, Porat said in a conference call.\n\nAdvertising is coming to the company's revamped search, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on the call. Alphabet is testing what formats are effective and where to place ads inside of its AI-powered search.\n\nPresently, 80% of advertisers use at least one AI-driven search product, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said on the call.\n\nThe company plans to integrate generative AI into other products such as Gmail, Google Photos and its Android mobile operating system. Generative AI tech can create text, images and video that resemble what people produce.\n\nStill, the results released on Tuesday show that ad sales are still king. Investors punished social media company Snap (SNAP.N) on Tuesday for its disappointing ad sales in the quarter.\n\nRevenue at Google Cloud, which is among the biggest cloud service providers, rose 28% to $8.1 billion, besting expectations of $7.75 billion, and maintaining roughly the same rate of growth as the first quarter. Microsoft's Azure revenue rose 26%, ahead of the growth estimate from Visible Alpha.\n\nAnalysts and industry experts have said they expect cloud business growth to pick up toward the end of the year, with quarter-ended June being the trough as macro uncertainty begins to clear.\n\nInvestors expect AI to become a major growth driver for cloud businesses within a year, with Microsoft's Azure leading the pack followed by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS and Google Cloud.\n\nAd sales for Google's YouTube video service unit rose 4.4% to $7.67 billion.\n\nAlphabet reported net profit of $1.44 per share for the April-June period, compared with estimates of $1.34 per share.\n\nRevenue for the quarter stood at $74.6 billion, compared with estimates of $72.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data.","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"Key takeaways:\nMacy\u2019s online sales declined 10% in the quarter.\nThe Macy\u2019s flagship brand had the largest declines in sales, followed by Bloomingdale\u2019s.\nThe department store says the online marketplace is growing.\nMacy\u2019s Inc. reported online sales declined 10% in the second quarter ended July 29, 2023. Net sales declined 8% during the period to $5.13 billion. Brick-and-mortar store sales also declined 8% over the year-ago period. \n\nDespite lagging sales, Macy\u2019s did manage to beat analyst expectations. However, the retailer\u2019s declining sales are signs of deeper problems, according to Neil Saunders, managing director at retail research firm GlobalData.\n\n\u201cEffort, imagination, creativity, and determination are needed to turn Macy\u2019s around. Sadly, these are qualities that Macy\u2019s has traditionally lacked, so it remains debatable as to whether a revival can be engineered,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nMacy\u2019s is No. 17  in the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of North America\u2019s online retailers by web sales.\n\nConsumer spending declined\nMuch of the sales slump can be blamed on broader economic trends, says Macy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette in a transcript via Seeking Alpha.\n\n\u201cOver the last several quarters, we have seen Macy\u2019s customers more aggressively pull back on spending in our discretionary categories,\u201d he says.\n\nAbout half of Macy\u2019s customers have annual household incomes of $75,000 or less, and those customers are cutting spending and shifting priorities toward experiences over goods.\n\nThere may be a deeper problem, though. Sales are 7.5% lower than they were in Q2 of 2019.\n\nMacy\u2019s sales decline is \u201csignificantly worse than the overall market,\u201d Saunders says. \u201cThis puts the better performance achieved during the pandemic years into perspective: Macy\u2019s was a beneficiary of circumstance rather than the author of its success. With the advantages of a strong economy now firmly behind us, Macy\u2019s is back to being one of the laggards of retail.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s online marketplace\nMacy\u2019s digital marketplace, launched in October 2022, is a potential bright spot going forward, the retailer says. The retailer nearly tripled the number of brands available on the marketplace to 1,350, and GMV grew 116% since the previous quarter.\n\nThe marketplace is also valuable as a place to test brands and merchandise before potentially offering them in stores, Macy\u2019s says. The department store recently announced Max Magni would join Macy\u2019s as chief customer and digital officer to guide online growth.\n\nThe retailer also \u201csoft-launched\u201d an online marketplace for Bloomingdale\u2019s in July. Customers are responding well so far, Macy\u2019s said.\n\nComparing brands\nSome of Macy\u2019s brands fared better than others. The flagship Macy\u2019s brand reported the biggest declines, at 9.2%. Bloomingdale\u2019s net sales declined more slowly, down 3.6% year over year. Comparable store sales declined just 2.6%. Bloomingdale\u2019s outlets outperformed standard Bloomingdale\u2019s locations, Macy\u2019s said. \n\nSkin care brand Blue Mercury was the only section of the business where sales grew. Net sales grew 5.6% and comparable sales grew 5.8%.\n\n\u201cCustomers continue to respond well to our skin care and color cosmetic brands,\u201d Gennette said.\n\nMacy\u2019s also announced a new private label brand, On 34th, targeting female consumers age 30 to 50. Sales have surpassed expectations so far, Gennette says, with the \u201cpotential to become one of our biggest private brands.\u201d\n\nSaunders is cautiously optimistic about On 34th, too.\n\n\u201cThis collection is far better than many of Macy\u2019s existing lines and has been assembled with some care and attention to detail. \u2026 While On 34th cannot in and of itself pull Macy\u2019s out of the mire, it is an example of the type of initiative that is needed to start moving the dial.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s earnings\nFor the fiscal second quarter ended July 29, Macy\u2019s reported:\nNet sales declined 8% to $5.13 billion.\nMacy\u2019s online sales declined 10%.\nIn-store sales declined 8%.\nFor the six months ended July 29, Macy\u2019s reported:\nNet sales were $10.11 billion, down from $10.95 in the year-ago period.\nOperating income was $368 million, down from $862 million.\nPercentage changes may not align exactly with dollar figures due to rounding.

{"text":"Supply chain chaos will likely persist through to the middle of next year, according to Jim Snabe, chairman of German conglomerate Siemens and Danish shipping firm Maersk.\n\nBusinesses and consumers around the world are currently facing lengthy delays on products and materials because of supply chain issues.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC\u2019s Annette Weisbach on Tuesday, Snabe said: \u201cRight now, we have congestion primarily in the West Coast of the U.S. where the ports are full of containers.\u201d\n\nWhile many countries have been closed to travelers at various times during the coronavirus pandemic, supply chains and transportation routes have remained largely open.\n\n\u201cThe trade of goods has actually gone up, not down,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere was a short period when the factories closed when the volumes went down but since the middle of 2020, the demand for physical products has gone up dramatically.\u201d\n\nSiemens Chairman: We will see many more Covid-19 waves\nThe pandemic has resulted in more people working remotely and investing in their homes.\n\n\u201cThe trade of goods has actually gone up, not down,\u201d Snabe said, adding that he believes this is because people don\u2019t spend as much on services anymore. \u201cWe don\u2019t go to restaurants so much, we don\u2019t go to the cinema, we don\u2019t travel. People are home and they want to improve their homes.\u201d\n\nOne of the main issues, Snabe said, is there aren\u2019t enough truck drivers to pick up containers from the ports.\n\nBy the end of last week, 84 vessels had to wait for an average of 18 days in front of ports, Snabe said. \u201cThat takes capacity out of the shipping industry because they are lying there idle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have higher demand and lower capacity, not because we don\u2019t have enough vessels, but because they are not sailing because of congestion,\u201d Snabe added. \u201cWe have to balance that out. We think this will happen somewhere mid-next year, but maybe not before.\u201d\n\nImportant items used in areas like healthcare can often be fast-tracked when necessary, Snabe said.\n\nSemiconductors have been in particularly short supply during the pandemic, leading some car companies to pull semiconductor-reliant features from their vehicles and lengthy delays on products such as Sony\u2019s PS5.\n\n\u201cWe can make sure that that we can deliver,\u201d Snabe said, adding that Siemens has a \u201cpreferred relationship\u201d with its semiconductor suppliers.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}
{"text":"Limited supplier finance reporting rules can mask trouble\nIndustry volume has increased to $2.2 trillion worldwide\nThe accounting scandal that led to a $4 billion hole in the balance sheet of major Brazilian retailer Americanas SA centers on a common funding tool with notoriously opaque reporting: supplier finance.\n\nAmericanas, which nosedived into bankruptcy protection last week, is an extreme example of how the arcane practice, also called supply-chain finance or reverse factoring, can take advantage of loose accounting rules to flatter a company\u2019s balance sheet. The process involves a bank or third party paying a buyer\u2019s suppliers at a discount earlier than they would be otherwise.\n\nAmericanas hasn\u2019t revealed much detail of how it used supplier financing to mask its indebtedness, and its financial statements offer few clues. The company did not return multiple requests for comment. But what\u2019s clear is that the practice played at least some part in masking more than 20 billion reais ($3.9 billion) of debt.\n\n\u201cWe see the nature of that supplier finance is more of bank debt nature,\u201d former Chief Executive Officer Sergio Rial told investors on Jan. 11. \u201cSo I have more debt than I had originally thought.\u201d\n\nRegulators, credit rating providers, and some investors have warned for years about the lack of accounting rules for these supplier-finance arrangements. Companies following US-based accounting rules must start disclosing this year that they use the financing.\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board, which sets the financial reporting guidelines used by Americanas, is mulling similar disclosures. The board met Wednesday to vote on when to make new disclosures mandatory, but put off the decision for another month.\n\n\u201cIf this is something that makes the headlines, I think we just are sending a very bad signal,\u201d IASB\u2019s Chair Andreas Barckow said of delaying the disclosures.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that supplier finance has played a role in major corporate financial collapses. Carillion Plc became one of the UK\u2019s largest corporate failures in 2018, with the defunct contractor using reverse factoring to label almost half a billion pounds of debt as \u201cother payables.\u201d Abengoa, a Spanish energy company, was brought close to insolvency in 2015, with supply-chain finance once again playing a large part.\n\nLack of Clarity\nIn a supplier finance transaction, banks provide what\u2019s essentially a short-term loan to help companies pay suppliers quickly. A company then pays the lender back later, sometimes 90 days or more. The retailer frees up cash by doing so.\n\nSuch arrangements between investment-grade companies and suppliers are considered low risk, but regulators and credit rating providers worry about companies on shaky footing using these tools to mask indebtedness \u2013 out of the sight of investors and analysts.\n\nEven as some have sounded warnings about a proliferation of supply-chain finance, the practice continues to grow. Issuance in 2022 hit $2.2 trillion worldwide, according to an estimate from BCR Publishing\u2019s World Supply Chain Finance Report published on Tuesday.\n\nSupplier financing itself isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, and suppliers sometimes prefer to get paid sooner even at a discount. The issue is a lack of clarity as to what companies actually have to disclose about their financing arrangements with suppliers, according to Peter Parry, who is on the policy team for the UK Shareholders Association.\n\n\u201cBecause companies are not obliged to disclose this, they\u2019re able to hide the fact that there is a major cash-flow problem,\u201d Parry said. \u201cIt\u2019s utterly opaque.\u201d\n\nSome Progress\nAccounting bodies have made some progress in attempting to improve transparency. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which don\u2019t govern Americanas\u2019s reporting published rules in September that come into effect this month forcing companies to disclose that they use supplier finance programs and how much is at stake.\n\nNew disclosure requirements would make it harder for blow ups like Americanas and others happen, but it could take years for changes to be made.\n\n\u201cDefinitely the new disclosures would solve that problem \u2014 there\u2019d be no chance of having supply chain financing and investors not knowing about it,\u201d said Steve Cooper, author of The Footnotes Analyst blog and a member of the IASB from 2007 to 2017. \u201cThis is exactly the type of situation here where the disclosures are important.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress"]}

A red pickup is in the foreground.\nFord Motor sales nudged up in January from a year earlier, with electric vehicles leading the way.Credit...Cydni Elledge for The New York Times\n\nFord Motor said on Thursday that it lost $2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.\n\nThe company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $2.8 billion last year. Ford said on Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.\n\nThe automaker said its revenue had risen about 16 percent, to $158 billion, mainly because of higher car prices. The company sold 4.2 million vehicles worldwide, up from 3.9 million in 2021.\n\nFord has long struggled to reduce defects and recalls in its cars and trucks. Recalls can be expensive and time consuming, and company executives said on Thursday that they were working to improve the reliability of their vehicles.\n\n\u201cIn simple terms, we need to improve quality and lower costs now,\u201d the company\u2019s chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call.\n\nThe Rise of Electric Vehicles\nSearching for a Rental: A New York Times reporter was determined to rent an electric vehicle for environmental reasons. But from booking to driving, there\u2019s a learning curve.\nCharging Network: Seven major automakers announced a plan to build 30,000 charging ports in the United States and Canada in an effort to persuade more people to buy electric cars and trucks.\nFalling Prices: Ford, Tesla and other automakers are having to lower prices to lure buyers as the supply of battery-powered models begins to exceed demand.\nA New Job for Electric Cars: Some energy experts say battery-powered vehicles could increasingly help keep the lights on and support electric grids, rather than straining them, during blackouts.\nFord\u2019s performance was also hurt by a $600 million loss stemming from its joint ventures in China and about $12 billion in special expenses, including those related to Argo and Rivian, which has lost much of its value since it listed on the stock exchange in November 2021.\n\nExcluding the special expenses, interest and taxes, Ford made a $10.4 billion profit last year, it said, roughly as much as in 2021.\n\n\u201cWe should have done much better last year,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.\n\nIn the last three months of the year, Ford had a $1.3 billion profit, a steep drop from a year earlier, when it booked a large gain from its stake in Rivian. Ford\u2019s revenue in the final three months of 2022 rose 17 percent, to $44 billion.\n\nThe company sold 1.15 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.1 million a year earlier but about 500,000 fewer than Ford had expected, Mr. Lawler said.\n\nFord\u2019s production has been slowed by the global shortage of computer chips, and Mr. Lawler said the company expected some disruptions to continue this year and a slight increase in production volume.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, there is still going to be volatility on chips,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the older chips used in the auto industry, there is still capacity constraint.\u201d\n\nFord said it expected this year\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\nShares of Ford stock were down about 7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Ford said that its sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2 percent in January and that its sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.\n\nThe automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, up from 142,445 in January 2022, when a shortage of computer chips slowed production and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of January, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier, a strong signal that supply chain problems were easing.\n\nModels responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, the Bronco sport utility vehicle and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V.s, up 11 percent.\n\nFord halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitl\u00e1n, just north of Mexico City, to increase output. Production will restart this month, the company said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Honda, Hyundai and Kia reported sales increases of 9 percent to 22 percent, also as a result of improved supplies of vehicles.

{"text":"Aug 30 (Reuters) - A California federal judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit accusing X, the social media service formerly called Twitter, of disproportionately laying off older workers when Elon Musk acquired the company last year.\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Illston on Tuesday said the plaintiff in the proposed class action, John Zeman, had provided enough evidence that the mass layoffs had a greater impact on older employees to continue pursing the case.\n\nZeman, for example, claims X laid off 60% of workers who were 50 or older and nearly three-quarters of those who were over 60, compared with 54% of employees younger than 50.\n\nIllston ruled that the federal law banning workplace age bias allows plaintiffs to bring so-called \"disparate impact\" claims in a class action, an issue that has divided courts.\n\nThe judge dismissed a claim that X intentionally targeted older workers for layoffs, but gave Zeman a month to file an amended lawsuit fleshing out that claim.\n\nShannon Liss-Riordan, Zeman's lawyer, said \"this decision validates the arguments we are making that the discrimination claims can go forward.\"\n\nX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of about a dozen X is facing stemming from Musk's decision to lay off about half of Twitter's workforce beginning last November.\n\nThose cases include various claims, including that X laid off employees and contractors without the required advance notice and that Musk forced out workers with disabilities by refusing to allow remote work and calling on employees to be more \"hardcore.\"\n\nAt least two lawsuits claim the company owes ex-employees at least $500 million in severance pay.

{"text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Congressional report published Thursday offered a blistering critique of popular Chinese retailers Shein and Temu, with lawmakers accusing the latter of failing to maintain \u201ceven the fa\u00e7ade of a meaningful compliance program\u201d that seeks to prevent goods made by forced labor from being sold on its platform.\n\nIn the report, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said Temu\u2019s business model essentially allows the company to avoid responsibility in complying with a U.S. law that block imports from China\u2019s Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers should know that there is an extremely high risk that Temu\u2019s supply chains are contaminated with forced labor,\u201d the report said.\n\nTemu is owned by Pinduoduo Inc., a popular e-commerce site in China. It was launched in the U.S. last year and has grown in popularity by offering cheap goods, from apparel to home products, from China-based sellers.\n\nThe report is part of an ongoing Congressional investigation into products offered to American consumers that could be made with forced labor in China. As part of the probe, the committee sent letters in early May to brands Nike and Adidas, as well as Shein and Temu asking for information about their compliance with the anti-forced labor law.\n\nLawmakers noted they weren\u2019t done with their investigation but wanted to quickly share some of their findings with the public.\n\nThe report said Temu admitted it \u201cdoes not expressly prohibit\u201d the sale of goods from Xinjiang and \u201cconducts no audits and reports no compliance system to affirmatively examine\u201d whether its suppliers are observing U.S. forced labor law. It also said the only deterring measure the company reported was making its suppliers agree to \u201cboilerplate terms and conditions\u201d that prohibit forced labor use.\n\nAccording to documents Temu provided to the committee, the company has more than 80,000 suppliers that fuel its vast e-commerce platform.\n\nThe report comes a few months after representatives with \u201cShut Down Shein,\u201d an anonymous coalition of brands and human rights organizations, began meeting with congressional offices seeking to increase scrutiny on the fast fashion site.\n\nLast week, two bipartisan bills were introduced in Congress seeking to make changes to a century-old trade rule - known as de minimis - that benefits both Shein and Temu.\n\nUnder the provision, imported packages valued under $800 receive tax exemptions and less oversight from U.S. customs. The report said Temu and Shein ship nearly all their packages, most of which are valued under $800, from China directly to consumers. Typically retailers ship overseas goods to a domestic warehouse, pay the required taxes, and then deliver packages to consumers. It said the two companies are likely responsible for nearly half of all de minimis shipments, resulting in a huge tax break and minimal oversight.\n\nLawmakers also criticized Shein for relying on the provision.\n\n\u201cTemu and Shein are building empires around the de minimis loophole in our import rules \u2014 dodging import taxes and evading scrutiny on the millions of goods they sell to Americans,\u201d Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the committee, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a hard look at this loophole that is being abused to tilt the playing field against American companies,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, Shein said the company\u2019s \u201cpolicy is to comply with the customs and import laws of the countries in which we operate.\u201d It also said it has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for forced labor and has implemented a robust system to ensure compliance with U.S. law.\n\nTemu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

The group is believed to be operating on behalf of the Belarusian government.\n\nESET is aware of attacks against the Belarusian embassies of four countries: two in Europe, one in Africa, and one in South Asia. \n\nThe security company\u2019s researchers have identified several pieces of malware used by the cyberspies, including ones named NightClub, Disco, and SharpDisco. The malware and their plugins enable the attackers to monitor files and exfiltrate data from compromised systems, including files, screenshots and audio recordings. \n\nAt least some of these malware families are believed to have been delivered using AitM attacks at the ISP level, with the traffic of targeted IP addresses being redirected to a fake Windows update site set up to distribute malware. ESET has named two Belarusian ISPs that may be involved in the operation: Unitary Enterprise A1 and Beltelecom.\n\n\nThe cybersecurity firm has found evidence suggesting that MoustachedBouncer has been collaborating with a Russia-linked group named Winter Vivern, which has targeted government entities in Europe and Asia, including NATO members.  \n\nThe company believes that Belarusian state-sponsored threat actors are using a lawful surveillance system named System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM) to conduct the attacks. \n\nTelecom providers in the country are required by law to ensure that their hardware is compatible with the SORM system, which gives authorities direct access to user communications and associated data without the need to notify the provider. \n\nADVERTISEMENT. SCROLL TO CONTINUE READING.\nThe Hub for Industrial Cybersecurity - Join us in Atlanta\nESET noted that it cannot completely rule out the possibility that the AitM attacks were launched using compromised routers within the targeted embassies, but these lawful interception capabilities make it more likely that the attacks are being conducted at ISP level. \n\n\u201cThe main takeaway is that organizations in foreign countries where the internet cannot be trusted should use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel to a trusted location for all their internet traffic in order to circumvent any network inspection devices,\u201d ESET concluded. \n\nRelated: Mandiant Attributes Ghostwriter APT Attacks to Belarus\n\nRelated: Russia-Linked APT29 Uses New Malware in Embassy Attacks","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"DETROIT -- The Detroit Auto Show is underway this week, against the backdrop of an historic strike effort from unionized auto workers.\n\nAlmost every year since 1907, Detroit has played host to a trade show that attracts executives, celebrities, politicians, journalists, and everyday enthusiasts from around the car world, all of whom descend on the city\u2019s Huntington Place convention center to check out the latest the automotive industry has to offer. At this year\u2019s show, Ford pulled the wraps off an updated F-150 pickup truck, and GMC showed off a new Acadia SUV.\n\nLast year, Ford\u2019s latest Mustang made its debut at the show, and President Biden was one of several high-profile attendees.\n\nPHOTO: The UAW Solidarity House is seen on Sept. 14, 2023, in Detroit.\nThe UAW Solidarity House is seen on Sept. 14, 2023, in Detroit.\nMichael Dobuski\/ABC News\nWhile other cities regularly host big auto shows, experts say Detroit has long been the most influential in the American car industry.\n\n\u201cIt was the biggest, it had the most people, it had just the most excitement,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, Director of Insights at Edmunds, says of past Detroit Auto Shows.\n\nAdvertisement\nBut this year, the event is confronting a UAW strike that has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry.\n\nFor the first time in its history, union auto workers are striking all \u201cBig Three\u201d American automakers simultaneously. The strike could see up to 146,000 unionized auto workers walk off the job at General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. And for a show that\u2019s estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the local economy, it comes at a critical moment.\n\nPHOTO: Ford unveils updated F-150 at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept.12, 2023 in Detroit.\nFord unveils updated F-150 at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept.12, 2023 in Detroit.\nMichael Dobuski\/ABC News\nCaldwell says the strike will likely have an impact on attendance at the 2023 Detroit Auto Show, especially considering the city\u2019s close ties to the auto industry.\n\n\u201cHere in Detroit, [most people] know the intricacies of the auto industry and realize what some of the issues are with these workers - perhaps even know someone in the auto industry themselves.\u201d\n\nUAW workers are striking for increased wages and the restoration of certain benefits. They argue their proposals are fair given the profits Big Three automakers have seen in recent years, and are proportional to the wage and benefit increases the executives at their respective companies have seen. The automakers have argued they need that money to aid the transition to electric vehicles, and to be competitive against carmakers that don't have unionized workforces.\n\n\n\u201cStrikes are generally not happy events and auto shows are happy events.\u201d says Caldwell, \u201cSo it is kind of a push-pull here.\u201d\n\nThe UAW strike isn\u2019t the only challenge the Detroit Auto Show is facing.\n\n\u201cThe Detroit Auto Show is still reeling and trying to recover from the pandemic,\u201d says Mike Martinez, a reporter with Automotive News.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic forced organizers to cancel the 2020 and 2021 iterations of the show, the event returned in 2022 with a new, smaller footprint that added outdoor activities. That shows failed to attract crowds seen at earlier Detroit Auto Shows. Thad Szott, the President of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, estimated that the 2022 show drew in between 300,000 and 500,000 attendees. That\u2019s a far cry from the nearly 775,000 people it attracted in 2019.\n\nRegardless, the updated format is in place again for 2023. Ford, this year, unveiled the latest F-150 outdoors at the nearby Hart Plaza. The event featured live music, food trucks, and a lineup of antique Ford pickup trucks.\n\nRecent Stories from ABC News\n\u201cIt's smaller scale than it used to be,\u201d says Martinez. \u201cSo it's still trying to gain some publicity and draw in attendees, draw in media.\u201d\n\nJessica Caldwell says the show\u2019s smaller stature was evident even during the media preview days, which made the event feel \u201calmost like a regional show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're really only seeing news from the Detroit automakers: from Ford, from General Motors, from Stellantis,\u201d says Caldwell.\n\n\u201cNormally you would see news from, you know, maybe a Honda or a Hyundai \u2026 we\u2019re not seeing that this year,\u201d says Caldwell.\n\nPHOTO: Jeff Gilbert, President of the North American Car Of The Year Awards, speaks at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept. 13, 2023, in Detroit.\nJeff Gilbert, President of the North American Car Of The Year Awards, speaks at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept. 13, 2023, in Detroit.\nMichael Dobuski\/ABC News\nIn addition to Ford\u2019s updated F-150 and GMC\u2019s new Acadia, Cadillac unveiled a facelifted CT5 sedan, and Jeep similarly refreshed its Gladiator pickup.

The items will be distributed in the wake of natural disasters to nonprofits and other aid partners that quickly help communities impacted by hurricanes or other disasters. The Disaster Relief Hub is a dedicated space within Amazon\u2019s global logistics network to store and quickly pack items that are most-needed following damaging storms and other emergencies.\n\n\"As natural disasters increase in frequency and severity, we\u2019re expanding our Disaster Relief Hub in Atlanta, allowing us to deliver more items in less time during this year\u2019s hurricane season,\" said Abe Diaz, head of Amazon Disaster Relief. \"Since 2017, we\u2019ve responded to more than 100 natural disasters and humanitarian crises in the U.S. and across the world. We\u2019ve donated more than 23 million relief items, and we\u2019ve mobilized our teams and used our logistics capabilities to help communities in need\u2014from flying two cargo planes to T\u00fcrkiye after the recent earthquakes to setting up two humanitarian hubs in just 10 days to help Ukrainian refugees.\"\n\nAmazon works year-round with national and international relief organizations\u2014such as the American Red Cross, Save the Children, and World Central Kitchen\u2014to identify items that will most likely be needed after natural disasters. Data shows that more than 80% of the needed items are the same after each natural event.\n\nUsing such data and forecasts from relief organizations, Amazon teams are able to pack tens of thousands of relief items and have them ready to deploy as soon as it\u2019s safe following a natural disaster. Some of the most frequently requested products include diapers, tarps, cots, blankets, heaters, tents, solar lights and chargers, and cleaning supplies.\n\n\"We are extremely grateful for our collaboration with Amazon. During times of disaster, companies like Amazon enable the American Red Cross to carry out our mission and serve those in need. As we start another hurricane season, it is critical we have stocked warehouses and relief supplies to help at a moment\u2019s notice,\" said Dee Dixon, regional chief executive officer of the American Red Cross of Georgia. \"Amazon\u2019s donation and commitment to disaster relief and preparedness help the Red Cross respond to communities and families in need across the country.\"\n\nImproving disaster response through cloud technology\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is helping organizations use the power of cloud computing to improve disaster response. For example, AWS is working with the American Red Cross to better serve communities by innovating cloud computing-enabled solutions, including powering Alexa-enabled devices to receive hurricane alerts and to schedule blood donations.\n\nAWS also has a dedicated Disaster Response team that helps standby partners\u2014including relief organizations and nonprofits\u2014prepare for and respond to disasters globally with the cloud. This includes testing proof-of-concepts and fine-tuning existing innovations under simulated disaster conditions, with support from AWS Disaster Response vehicles. These vehicles are enabled with technology like AWS Snowball Edge devices, which are powerful and portable cloud computing devices designed for rugged deployments in the harshest physical environments.\n\nAWS has used cloud technology to help standby partners with mapping and damage assessment of hard-hit areas, re-establishing internet connectivity, and scaling call centers to handle increased requests after a disaster. The team also provides computing power for responding organizations in the field to process information on-site, enabling them to make faster decisions about where to focus response efforts.\n\nIn the past 18 months alone, Amazon has responded to major disasters and humanitarian crises across the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida, the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, as well as tornadoes, wildfires, and floods.\n\nTo learn more about Amazon disaster relief and response efforts, visit https:\/\/www.aboutamazon.com\/impact\/community\/disaster-relief\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20230601005336\/en\/","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Grocery delivery service Instacart on Friday said its core business turned profitable after making public its filing for a long-awaited stock market launch, while also disclosing an investment from PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O).\n\nSan Francisco-based Instacart, which filed confidentially for its initial public offering (IPO) in May 2022, said in the filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that PepsiCo had agreed to buy $175 million in preferred convertible stock.\n\nNorges Bank Investment Management, a division of Norges Bank, and entities affiliated with venture capital firms TCV, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and Valiant Capital Management have agreed to participate in the IPO as cornerstone investors, Instacart said.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, Instacart's revenue came in at $1.48 billion, up 31% from the same period last year. Advertising and other revenue surged 24% to $406 million. It reported net income of $242 million during the six-month period, compared to a $74 million loss a year earlier.\n\nInstacart's push to go public comes days after SoftBank Group-backed (9984.T) chip designer Arm Holdings disclosed the paperwork for its IPO filing.\n\nLike Arm and marketing automation firm Klaviyo, Instacart is expected to list its shares in September - part of a wave of high-profile names testing investor appetite for new stocks. The market for new listings has been subdued for most of the last two years due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the spike in interest rates.\n\n\nIf successful, the listings could revitalise the U.S. IPO market, which has already seen some green shoots this year on bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate policy could guide the economy to a \"soft landing.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to see more companies kick off their (IPO) process in 2024, which is when a healthy IPO market will return,\" said Mike Bellin, IPO services leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers U.S.\n\nThe fact that Instacart is generating a profit could also help it find favour among wary IPO investors, who since last year have stayed away from listings of loss-making startups, analysts said.\n\nLONG ROAD TO IPO\nInstacart's move to go public comes years after it first started making preparations for a stock market debut. Reuters reported in November 2020 that it hired Goldman Sachs to help lay the groundwork.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen, and Brandon Leonardo, Instacart brought in former Facebook executive Fidji Simo as its Chief Executive Officer and former Goldman Sachs technology banker Nick Giovanni as its Chief Financial Officer in 2021 as part of its preparations to go public.\n\nIn March 2021, Instacart added Snowflake (SNOW.N) CEO Frank Slootman, a software industry veteran behind some big IPOs, to its board.\n\nCustomers can order through the Instacart app, and an Instacart \"shopper\" delivers the product in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nThe company has also expanded its delivery business to non-grocery goods such as those from beauty product retailer Sephora, convenience store 7-Eleven and pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS.N).\n\nAccording to data by Euromonitor, the online grocery sector was set to be the largest source of growth for the U.S. food and beverage industry, adding nearly $100 billion in sales by 2027.\n\nThe company also sells software-as-a-service offerings targeted at retailers and charges fees for such offerings.\n\nIts core delivery business received a boost in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a surge in online orders. But as lockdown restrictions started easing from 2021, growth slowed down and market volatility forced the company to revise its valuation.\n\nIn December 2022, Instacart slashed its internal valuation to as low as $10 billion, 74% less than the $39 billion price tag in its funding round in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not expect our pandemic-accelerated growth rates to recur in future periods, our growth during this period helped establish a business with much greater scale and much higher gross profit,\u201d Instacart said in the filing, known as an S-1.\n\nInstacart had earlier planned to list in the fourth quarter of last year, but deferred those plans as a sell-off in technology stocks and the Fed's rate hikes caused a rout in equities.\n\nThe company filed for the IPO as \"Maplebear,\" the name under which it was incorporated.\n\nGoldman Sachs and J.P.Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering, Instacart said, adding that its shares would be listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"CART.\"","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"Amazon violated labor law in advance of unionization elections last year at two warehouses on Staten Island, a federal administrative judge has ruled.\n\nThe judge, who hears cases for the National Labor Relations Board, ruled on Monday that Amazon supervisors had illegally threatened to withhold wage and benefit increases from employees at the warehouses if they voted to unionize. The judge, Benjamin W. Green, also ruled that Amazon had illegally removed posts on a digital message board from an employee inviting co-workers to sign a petition being circulated by the Amazon Labor Union. The union sought to represent workers at both warehouses.\n\nThe ruling ordered Amazon to stop the unfair labor practices and to post a notice saying it would not engage in them.\n\nIn the same ruling, the judge dismissed several accusations brought in a complaint by the labor board\u2019s prosecutors, including charges that Amazon indicated take-home pay would fall if workers unionized; that Amazon promised improvements in a program that subsidizes workers\u2019 educational expenses if they chose not to unionize; and that Amazon indicated that workers would be fired if they unionized and failed to pay union dues.\n\nThe judge found that these accusations were either overstated or, in the final instance, that the action was not illegal.\n\nAmazon can appeal the ruling to the labor board in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that the judge dismissed 19 \u2014 nearly all \u2014 of the allegations in this case,\u201d Mary Kate Paradis, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement, adding: \u201cThe facts continue to show that the teams in our buildings work hard to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe union declined to comment.\n\nThe violations occurred at a vast Amazon warehouse known as JFK8, where workers voted to unionize in an election whose results were announced in April, and at a smaller, nearby warehouse known as LDJ5, where workers voted down a union the next month.\n\nIn the weeks before the elections, Amazon summoned employees at the warehouses to dozens of anti-union meetings at which supervisors questioned the credibility of the Amazon Labor Union, emphasized the costliness of union dues and warned that workers could end up worse off under a union.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling set aside a broader question brought by labor board prosecutors: whether employers can force workers to attend such meetings.\n\nThe meetings are legal under labor board precedent and common among employers facing union campaigns. But the board\u2019s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, has argued that the precedent is in tension with federal labor law and had sought to challenge it.\n\nJudge Green concluded that he lacked the authority to overturn the precedent. \u201cI am required to apply current law,\u201d he wrote.

He kind of hit the ball down the middle of the fairway.\u201d\n\nROHAN KHANNA, HEAD, EURO RATES STRATEGY, BARCLAYS, LONDON \"It's tough to rationalize the move (in bond markets). The speech is very balanced but clearly points to the risk of doing more rather than doing nothing at all. It's not about when do we start easing but whether we need to do more. So, the fixed income selloff reflects that.\"\n\nMICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON\n\u201cPowell continues to walk a tightrope. Unlike last year, where he really wanted to emphasize the Fed\u2019s inflation-fighting credibility, this year I think he is demonstrating that he is pleased with how far monetary policy has come and how inflation has been reduced. But he is still holding on tightly to this notion that they are watching it carefully and they still have work to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think that the market continues to underestimate the potential for at least one if not two more rate hikes should inflation remain above the Fed\u2019s target. Even this morning during the speech, he emphatically said 2% is and will remain our target. And as a result, until we get closer to those levels the Fed is likely more hawkish than dovish.\u201d\n\nBRIAN MULBERRY, CLIENT PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ZACKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO\n\n\"Early in Chair Powell's comments, he has described the difference clearly between short term declines in core PCE and the 12 month change, the longer term price comparisons show that restrictive monetary policy is still needed to bring sustained progress on overall prices. This is already weighing on markets as the slightly hawkish comments are showing that rates are likely to go higher and stay there for longer than markets have currently priced in.\"\n\nVIRAJ PATEL, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, VANDA RESEARCH, LONDON\n\"The fact that he said policy is well above most neutral estimates is not what the bond market has been pricing in recent weeks. So that's a disappointment for bond bears. He kept absolutely every possible option on the table by saying nothing new.\"\n\nJUAN PEREZ, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, MONEX, WASHINGTON\n\u201cMarkets are being provided little in terms of clear guidance because not even Fed officials can see clearly what difficulties may arise in the future.\u201d\n\nThe opening dinner of the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell walks into the opening dinner of the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, U.S., August 24, 2023. REUTERS\/Ann Saphir Acquire Licensing Rights\n\n\u201cIn the midst of an expanding American economy, Powell has to say that all moves will be very data-dependent, and he seems to feel no need to guarantee any pauses. The Dollar seems to be naturally strengthening, equities may even feel some downward pressure, but I still sense that down the line there will be a decoupling of Dollar-advancement tied to Fed hawkishness. There are signs that borrowing costs have increased to a point of denting demand, especially for Housing, so if anything there are chance the economy may not stay so hot in order to feel the need to hike interest rates again.\u201d\n\nCHRISTOPHER HODGE, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cHe was very quick to assure markets that the Fed won\u2019t be hanging any 'mission accomplished' banners any time soon, but still highlighted the need to data dependence. Clearly softer labor and economic indicators are needed before any pivot in tone, but just reiterating the higher for longer narrative by itself restricts financial conditions by pushing up mortgage and corp borrowing rates (see the Fed\u2019s FCI-G and movements along the curve in recent weeks) and may alleviate the need for more hikes.\"\n\n\"It was a change in emphasis, highlighting the potential need for more tightening, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that softer incoming data will keep the fed comfortable with current levels and allow previous hikes and current conditions to work their way through the system. I think the Fed is legitimately split on what to do now making incoming data, starting with next week\u2019s NFP and JOLTS, even more important.\"\n\nMICHAEL GREEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SIMPLIFY ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\u201cThe best way to think about it is: it was largely non information. It is an acknowledgment of some progress that has been made. It's a reiteration that the Fed at best is going to go very slowly and cautiously.\"\n\n\u201cPeople had been prepared for volatility if that volatility fails to emerge. Then the big winner here are people who had actually sold insurance in the market. I don't think anyone's going to meaningfully change their positions after this speech.\"\n\nANDRE BAKHOS, MANAGING MEMBER, INGENIUM ANALYTICS LLC, PLAINSBORO, NEW JERSEY.\n\n\"August has been a difficult month for the market, so it is hungry for news that will help reverse the trend. Investors are hanging on to every word, but the main takeaway is that Powell signalled that the Fed would raise rates if needed. Around that concept, we're going get intraday volatility.\"\n\nCARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO, ING, FRANKFURT\n\"The speech was as expected. I don't think it's overly dovish as the market reaction suggests. A pause in September is likely but this is not an official end to hikes. This is the best Powell could do in the current circumstances.\"\n\n\"The alternative would have been to sound very hawkish, triggering turmoil, or sound very dovish, which is not good if inflation comes back, so this strikes a good balance. I think (ECB chief Christine) Lagarde will do the same later.\u201d\n\nJOSEPH LAVORGNA, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cI have him leaning a little bit more on the hawkish side because it seems to me that while they're talking risk management, I just don't see anything that suggests that they're going to cut rates anytime soon.\"\n\n\u201cHe's finding the flexibility to hike more, not buying the flexibility necessarily to ease. It seems to me it's between hiking more and staying on hold rather than, \u2018OK we're kind of where we need to be and policy is symmetrical.\u2019 But, I don't think another hike is coming.\u201d\n\nSTUART COLE, CHIEF MACRO ECONOMIST, EQUITI CAPITAL, LONDON\n\n\u201cPowell\u2019s message is largely as expected, that is progress is being made in the fight against CPI but it is too soon to say the battle is won and the Fed is prepared to hike further if necessary. My hunch is that he is being seen as not as hawkish as had been feared.\u201d\n\nQUINCY KROSBY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n\"He is outlining the backdrop for the path of inflation, the trajectory that we have witnessed. But overall his core message is that two months, three months does not necessarily make the trend. There is still quite a bit to focus on. The 12-month trajectory is still elevated... He said there's still work to be done. And this is not different from some of the press conferences we have seen following the last couple of rate hikes. There's nothing in this that should be a surprise or a shock. He is staying close to his message, and that is we cannot declare victory yet.\"\n\nDAVID WAGNER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS, CINCINNATI, OHIO\n\"Historically, the average Jackson Hole event doesn\u2019t generate more market volatility than any other trading day. But, much like we expected, Jerome Powell took a pass this year as he kept his message clear and concise. He remained hawkish and held policy at restrictive levels until we brought inflation down. Even though inflation has come down, it remains too high.\"\n\n\"Given the market's expectation of 100bps worth of cuts by the end of '24, we think that this meeting will continue to fly in the face of investors as they will have to digest higher rates for longer, which can ultimately reintroduce the right tail risk of interest rates into the market causing valuations to contract.\"\n\n\"Powell basically disabused investors that cuts are right around the corner, with ample retread on how far they still are from their price objective.\"\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, WISCONSIN\n\"There were many words, but little was said. Rather than last year's short but brutal speech, Powell opted for a longer and calmer speech. The key word was 'carefully.' They will proceed carefully instead of forcefully.\"\n\n\"He was close to breaking his arm patting himself on the back for orchestrating a soft-landing. The jury is still out on that, though. Long and variable lags aren't dead.\"\n\nKARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CORPAY, TORONTO\n\"On balance, this is a modestly less hawkish speech than markets had feared. Powell recycled a lot of the \"higher for longer\" language used last year, but also said policymakers will \"proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data\" - messaging that clearly puts the central bank on a data-dependent footing in the near term.\"\n\n\"Powell's words lacked the drama associated with previous speeches from Bernanke and Draghi, and even fell short of the directness found in his own appearances, but we would argue this is a good thing - conditions remain too uncertain for black-and-white messaging, and markets should welcome a more gradualist and incremental approach at this point in the tightening cycle. Odds on another move by year end should come down, and the dollar looks likely to lose some altitude - particularly relative to the euro.\"\n\nCompiled by the Global Finance & Markets Breaking News team","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"DUBLIN, March 2 (Reuters) - Shares in CRH jumped 10% on Thursday after the building materials giant announced plans to buy back shares worth $3 billion, a more than three-fold increase on last year on the back of record sales and profits for 2022.\n\nDublin-based CRH also recommended moving its primary listing to the United States where it is the largest building materials supplier and made about 75% of its $5.6 billion in core earnings last year, which were up 13% and ahead of expectations.\n\nCRH Chief Executive Albert Manifold described the U.S. as a \"one-way bet\", with already robust demand boosted by government funding such as the $430 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and a rise in the onshoring of manufacturing activity due to geopolitical changes.\n\n\"The U.S. really is in good shape and we're facing I suspect five to 10 years of really strong growth,\" Manifold told Reuters in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We are now at an historic step-off point in the United States.

{"text":"Most readers would already be aware that Siemens Healthineers' (ETR:SHL) stock increased significantly by 15% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Siemens Healthineers' ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Siemens Healthineers\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Siemens Healthineers is:\n\n11% = \u20ac2.0b \u00f7 \u20ac19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every \u20ac1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20ac0.11 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nSiemens Healthineers' Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\nAt first glance, Siemens Healthineers seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This probably goes some way in explaining Siemens Healthineers' moderate 9.1% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Siemens Healthineers' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 18% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.\n\npast-earnings-growth\npast-earnings-growth\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SHL worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether SHL is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Siemens Healthineers Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nWhile Siemens Healthineers has a three-year median payout ratio of 53% (which means it retains 47% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.\n\nMoreover, Siemens Healthineers is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of four years of paying a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 45% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Siemens Healthineers' future ROE will rise to 14% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.\n\nSummary\nOn the whole, we do feel that Siemens Healthineers has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

In January, the board authorized the company to hire law firm ArentFox Schiff LLP to review policies, submit a report and make recommendations.\n\nMicrosoft published a 50-page transparency report from ArentFox on Tuesday. The report is significant in an industry that\u2019s making pronounced efforts to improve diversity and ensure that sexual misconduct is taken seriously. At Microsoft, claims of harassment and discrimination have led to internal discussions that spilled over into public view.\n\n\u201cThe board of directors and our senior leaders are fully committed to this implementation plan as we continually work to close the gap between our espoused culture and the lived experience of our employees,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a company blog post.\n\nThe shareholder proposal was brought last year by Arjuna Capital. It followed a report about Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates\u2019 departure from the company\u2019s board after it investigated a claim that Gates had tried to start a relationship with an employee two decades ago.\n\nSuch proposals typically fail, and the company had recommended that shareholders vote against it. But it received 77.97% of all votes, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe report on Tuesday referenced the Gates incident and provided some details. Kathleen Hogan is the company\u2019s head of human resources and executive vice president.\n\n\u201cOn July 7, 2019, Person A, a Microsoft employee, reported to Kathleen Hogan that Bill Gates had subjected her to inappropriate communications and conduct,\u201d the transparency report said. \u201cIn doing so, Person A made references to sexual harassment and the me too movement.\u201d\n\nThe woman met Gates for the first time in 1999, and they then met in person \u201cintermittently\u201d after that, the report said. The company hired a law firm to look into the woman\u2019s assertions and found that that they did meet and communicate. Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, discussed the assertions with Gates, who said that the relationship had been consensual.\n\nIn a statement, Arjuna Capital said the report, citing privacy reasons, doesn\u2019t offer much new detail on the investigation of Gates. But it acknowledged significant changes Microsoft has agreed to make around holding executives accountable.\n\nMicrosoft said in its blog post Tuesday that it will add language, as suggested in the report, to its policy against harassment and discrimination, enhance executive training, reevaluate the terms of substantiated violations of the policy and look at ways to address concerns about negative career impact for those who raise complaints.\n\nMicrosoft received 721 employee complaints of discrimination and harassment in the U.S. between 2019 and 2021, and investigators found most allegations to be unsubstantiated, according to the report.\n\nThe law firm spoke with some of the people who brought complaints in 2021 and found that many worried that their actions or being part of an investigation could hurt their career prospects, even if complaints were substantiated. Some of these people said their promotions or pay increases were delayed because their alleged harassment or discrimination had weighed on their performance reviews, and they were unhappy that human resources had told them there was no way to deal with that sort of impact.\n\nSome of the people the law firm interviewed said they disliked that investigators declared their complaints were unsubstantiated and not severe enough to violate Microsoft\u2019s policy against discrimination and harassment.\n\nMicrosoft said it will provide data each year on harassment reports, the percentage of claims that have been substantiated and the company\u2019s responses.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"Shares of Snowflake (SNOW) got a boost in aftermarket trading Wednesday after reporting second-quarter earnings that easily topped analyst expectations. But SNOW stock gave those gains back and ended up in the red Thursday.\n\nFor the period ended July 31, the cloud-data platform provider reported adjusted earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $674 million. The revenue marked a 36% increase from the $497 million in sales for the same period last year.\n\nSNOW stock analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of 10 cents per share on a 33% yearly sales rise, to $662 million.\n\nAlso, Snowflake officials reiterated their sales outlook for the rest of the company's fiscal 2024, which ends in January. The firm expects $2.6 billion in sales for the year, representing 34% year-over-year growth. But that outlook fell short of the $2.76 billion expected from analysts polled by FactSet ahead of Wednesday's earnings.\n\nSNOW shares took a hit in May when the company lowered its outlook for the year prior to first-quarter earnings. The company predicted 44% to 45% sales growth.\n\n\nPotential AI Boost?\nSNOW stock sank 5.2% to close at 147.67 on the stock market today.\n\nSnowflake reported its quarterly results as most eyes in the investor world were trained on the earnings report of chipmaker and artificial intelligence leader Nvidia (NVDA). Company officials said Snowflake also can benefit from the AI boom.\n\n\"Snowflake as the global epicenter of trusted enterprise data is well positioned to enable the growing interest in AI\/[machine learning],\" Snowflake Chairman and Chief Executive Frank Slootman said in written remarks. \"Enterprises and institutions alike are increasingly aware they cannot have an AI strategy without a data strategy.\"\n\nSnowflake announced in June that it was partnering with Nvidia to build custom large language models for AI.

But there were signs of improvement for the market leading up to Wednesday's earnings for Snowflake.\n\nNotably, Amazon (AMZN) earlier this month reported second-quarter sales growth for its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing unit that topped analyst expectations. SNOW stock climbed 3.5% in trading the day after Amazon's earnings report, on Aug. 4.\n\nProduct revenue for Snowflake increased 37% year over year to $642 million on the quarter. This metric accounts for customers using the company's software to store or analyze data.\n\nBut Snowflake management indicated its customers continue to keep an eye on software costs.\n\n\"Our forecast assumes that our largest customers will continue to be a growth headwind,\" Chief Financial Officer Michael Scarpelli said on the earnings call. \"We are seeing encouraging signs of stabilization, but not recovery.\"\n\nEncouraging Signs On Consumption\nSnowflake derives most of its revenue from charging for overall consumption of its product, rather than on a subscription basis.\n\nWilliam Blair reiterated an outperform rating on SNOW stock.\n\n\"Overall, though the company is still not in the clear regarding pressure on consumption, the signs are encouraging,\" William Blair analyst Jason Ader said in a note to clients. \"We expect that continued improvements in profitability as well as new growth tailwinds from AI should dovetail nicely with a recovery in cloud consumption next year.\"\n\nSNOW stock ended the regular trading session 2% higher at $155.70 on the stock market today. Overall, SNOW stock was up 8% for 2023 heading into earnings. But shares have fallen 12.5% this quarter.\n\nFurther, Snowflake stock holds a weak IBD Composite Rating of 56 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

We've gathered articles on the news from SHRM Online and other media outlets.\n\nLayoffs Challenged Based on Gender\n\nSoon after Elon Musk bought Twitter, the company laid off about 3,700 employees\u2014roughly half its workforce\u2014and hundreds more then resigned. The new lawsuit said that Twitter laid off 57 percent of its female employees, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender disparity was greater for engineering roles, where 63 percent of women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"It's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when Elon Musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,\" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, the plaintiffs' lawyer, who is in Boston.\n\nTwitter has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit involving the alleged failure to provide advance notice and hasn't responded to other complaints.\n\nOther Complaints\n\nOther complaints against Twitter claim it backed out of promises to allow remote work and provide consistent severance benefits after Musk bought the company, as well as complaints related to alleged disability- and gender-based discrimination and another lawsuit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off. At least one employee claimed that Twitter did not provide enough notice of the layoffs, allegedly violating federal and California laws, and did not offer additional pay in lieu of notice. Three claims also have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.\n\nTwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.\n\nLayoffs Snowball\n\nTwitter isn't the only company that has laid off workers. The technology sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands laid off, including from Meta and Stripe. Sales and recruiting jobs have sustained some of the deepest cuts. In addition, layoffs have spread beyond technology, such as to the Walt Disney Co.\n\nLayoffs Are Harming DE&I Efforts\n\nRecent layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, have eroded diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts nationwide. The tech industry already is one of the least diverse. In 2021, just 4.4 percent of employees at Google were Black and 6.4 percent were Latino, according to the company's diversity report.

One investment was in SenseTime, which a New York Times report linked to Chinese tracking and profiling of the Uyghurs.\n\nIn addition to Qualcomm, PitchBook data shows that U.S. firms Tiger Global Management and Silver Lake, which were not mentioned in the letter, invested in SenseTime prior to its 2021 IPO.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said Tiger had since fully exited its position in SenseTime, which it had taken on prior to the New York Times reporting.\n\nSilver Lake did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s investment in Denglin Technology, an apparent competitor, also faces Congressional scrutiny. Qualcomm was one of Denglin\u2019s earliest backers, according to PitchBook, and invested in an additional 2022 funding round.\n\nThe firm with the most potentially problematic investments, according to the letter is GGV Capital, which has offices in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore. The letter identified 43 different investments in Chinese AI companies from 2015 to 2021, more than any other identified by independent researchers at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nGGV has $9.2 billion in assets under management, and established operations on the ground in China in 2005. Even before that, it invested in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and subsequently backed TikTok parent ByteDance and ride-hailing company Didi.\n\nGallagher and Krishnamoorthi identify GGV\u2019s investment in Megvii, a Beijing-based facial recognition software provider, as a point of concern. The company \u201cactively supports the surveillance of Uyghurs,\u201d the letter says.\n\nMegvii is backed by a number of major investors, including Alibaba, Foxconn and the Macquarie Group. GGV invested in Megvii in 2019 alongside Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund in a deal that valued the company at about $4 billion.\n\nWalden, a smaller firm, was identified as a particularly significant backer of Chinese AI companies. The letter said that from 2015 to 2021, at least 39% of the firm\u2019s AI deals were in that sector, including one investment in a now blacklisted company called Intellifusion.\n\nIntellifusion has since gone public and has a market cap of 22 billion Chinese yuan, or roughly $3 billion.\n\nRegarding GSR Ventures, the letter said the firm \u201cwas among the top U.S.-located investors in PRC artificial intelligence companies between 2015 and 2021, according to a recent report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\u201d The lawmakers cited 33 distinct investments in the six-year period, including Horizon Robotics, which was last privately valued at $5 billion in 2021.\n\nThe letters advance Gallagher\u2019s push for controls on U.S. money in key technologies in China.\n\nAfter meeting with Silicon Valley executives in April, Gallagher told CNBC in an interview that he \u201cemerged from that day cautiously optimistic that we could put in place some sensible controls on American capital flowing to China that would allow us to not fund our own destruction or fund our own loss in the great AI race.\u201d \n\nHe said at the time he found there was \u201cbroad support\u201d among venture capitalists and others to keep U.S. asset managers from investing in Chinese AI firms.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has also considered steps to ensure U.S. technologies can\u2019t be overly leveraged by China to advance its own AI efforts. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the agency was weighing further limits on advanced chips used for AI that could be exported to China.\n\nPressure has been building on VC firms with substantial investments in China, in part due to concerns over intellectual property theft within technology and a budding AI race. Last month, legendary VC firm Sequoia Capital said it would split its international business into three parts, with Neil Shen helming its powerful Sequoia China unit.","labels":["investments"]}

It may not last\nWhile several countries owe even more as a percentage of their GDP \u2014 including the United States \u2014 Britain stands out for a different reason: Almost a quarter of its government debt is \u201cindex-linked,\u201d meaning it\u2019s tied to inflation.\n\nThat\u2019s double the share in Italy, whose dependence on inflation-linked debt comes second only to that of the UK among advanced economies, according to Fitch Ratings.\n\nAs prices in the UK have soared over the past 18 months, so have the repayments and the interest owed by the government on inflation-linked bonds.\n\nHigh inflation helped drive Britain\u2019s debt-servicing costs to their highest level as a share of GDP in more than four decades in the latest financial year, decimating the country\u2019s finances just as it grapples with feeble economic growth and draws closer to a general election.\n\nAccording to Fitch, Britain now spends more to service its debt than any other developed economy, as a percentage of government revenue.\n\n\u201cThe 2020s are turning out to be a very risky era for the public finances,\u201d the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, said in a report last month.\n\n\u201cIn just three years, they have been hit by the Covid pandemic in early 2020, the energy and cost-of-living crisis from mid-2021, and the sudden interest rate rises in 2022.\u201d\n\nAs an indication of how high borrowing has jumped, the UK government expects to spend \u00a3116 billion ($148 billion) on debt interest in the current financial year. That\u2019s behind only social security (\u00a3341 billion), health (\u00a3245 billion) and education (\u00a3131 billion).\n\nCredit downgrades looming?\nThe UK\u2019s growing debt burden puts it on shaky ground ahead of upcoming assessments by the three main credit ratings agencies. A downgrade to its credit rating, which is a reflection of a country\u2019s creditworthiness, could raise borrowing costs further still, although the impact may be limited.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming clear that rating agencies are placing an ever-greater scrutiny on debt-to-GDP ratios when making their decisions,\u201d wrote Ellie Henderson, an economist at Investec in London, in a note Tuesday.\n\nWhen Fitch stripped the United States of its top AAA rating earlier this month, it cited the country\u2019s high debt-to-GDP ratio as one of the reasons for the downgrade, she added. Fitch currently has the UK on a negative outlook, meaning it is at a higher risk of a downgrade to A from its current level of AA-. That would indicate a \u201chigh\u201d rather than \u201cvery high\u201d credit quality.\n\nA trader works the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell, on May 25, 2023, in New York City.

{"text":"BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 The Christmas blizzard of 2022 is long in the rearview mirror for a lot of people in Western New York, particularly as we languish in the heat of the August sun. \n\nOfficials with the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, however, are analyzing their response to the historic storm. \n\n\nOverall, 47 people were killed in the longest lasting blizzard below an altitude of 5,000 feet. Blizzard conditions engulfed Western New York around 8:45 a.m. on Friday, December 23 and lasted until Tuesday, December 27. \n\nOn Christmas, the storm shifted from a blizzard to a lake effect snow event. \n\nThe 33-page report, released by NYSDHSES, stated that 50 interviews were conducted and over 1,300 pages of relevant documents were reviewed. \n\nThe report highlighted poor communication, language and coordination as areas that impacted the states response. \n\nIt also points to the public underestimating the severity of the storm. \n\n\"When the storm that would become the Blizzard of \u201922 was initially forecast, it is possible that some WNY residents underestimated the need to prepare, given the recent relative ease of storm experience in November 2022,\" the report said. \n\nRegarding communication, the report highlights that the state did not use its NY-Alert system \"due to a low subscriber base.\"\n\nNY-Alert is a platform that users can receive emergency alerts from the state via phone, email, text or fax. \n\nOther communication that needs review is the way state agencies phrased announcements to the public. For example, the report highlights a communication by the NYSDOT for motorists to \"heed all warnings.\"\n\n\"A reference to 'heed all warnings' could have been enhanced by referring to the specific rules in place at that time,\" the report said. \n\nThe issue of the travel ban was a topic conversation and finger pointing in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The state report doesn't outright indicate a state travel ban should have been initiated earlier, but rather points to the evolving forecast as the reason why it wasn't.  \n\n\"This ban was enacted after inclement conditions appeared in the early morning, instead of Friday afternoon as the State planned for based on Thursday night\u2019s forecast. The midmorning travel ban meant that some drivers were still on the roads or had planned to be on the roads that day \u2013 even as the weather quickly deteriorated.\"\n\n\nAccording to the report, various state agencies rescued 649 people from the roads at the height of the blizzard. One recommendation in the report is for more state roads installing barriers. \n\n\"The State should consider the feasibility of adding additional barriers on roads that do not already have them, to allow for greater enforcement of travel bans.\"\n\nState officials did cite that Erie County was not using a current version of standard emergency management software. The report states that \"there were still usability challenges for response staff\" because the county uses an older version. \n\nErie County executive Mark Poloncarz rebuffed that conclusion in the report and said that \"there are no compatibility issues.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to 2 On Your Side, the county executive said:\n\n\"Erie County was proud to participate in New York State's After Action Report of the Christmas Blizzard by providing full access to all key county personnel involved in the storm response. We will be incorporating any relevant findings into our very active winter storm preparation process that is already well underway.\"\n\nBuffalo Mayor Brown, or anyone else from the administration, was unavailable for an interview regarding the report. Mayor Brown's office sent a statement saying:\n\n\"The Mayor is aware the State's After Action Report for the response to the December Blizzard is completed. City staff participated in the process as requested and we are currently reviewing the document. As previously announced, the City has established a Storm Response Task Force and has already purchased new equipment and adopted new storm-fighting procedures.\"\n\nOverall the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services didn't give itself a passing or failing grade in regards to their response to the blizzard. But the state acknowledges areas where agencies are working in silos and more collaboration is needed. \n\n\n\"The system cannot improve in isolation. Going forward, state agency partners, along with local officials should work towards an improved state emergency management through intentional communication.\"","labels":["natural_disasters"]}
{"text":"LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - First the good news.\n\nThe supply of minerals critical to the green energy transition could move close to levels needed to support climate pledges by 2030, according to the first annual review of the sector by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nInvestment in the critical minerals pipeline grew by 20% in 2021 and by 30% in 2022, led by lithium, copper and nickel.\n\nExploration spending was up by 20% last year with Canada and Australia both registering year-on-year growth of over 40%, notably in hard-rock lithium plays, according to the IEA.\n\n\nThe less good news is that the sector needs to do more if it is to match the level of demand required to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nMoreover, \"the adequacy of future supply is far from assured\", the IEA said.\n\nThe IEA highlighted potential problems with project delivery times, a continued lack of geographical diversification and \"mixed progress\" on improving sustainable and responsible practices in minerals and metals production.\n\nIEA clean energy equipment price index\nIEA clean energy equipment price index\nTIMING AND COST\nThe extended time-lag between a new mining or processing project being announced and delivered is a well-known issue in the metals sector.\n\nRisks of schedule delays and cost overruns have been \"prevalent in the past\" and \"cannot be ignored\" when projecting future supply, the IEA said.\n\nCopper mines are a good example, major new greenfield projects typically taking at least five years to enter production.\n\n\nThe problem is compounded in the case of lithium, a metal that is core to current battery technology, by the need to generate a high-purity product.\n\nThere is a significant step-up from producing technology-grade to achieving consistent battery-grade lithium. \"This means that even with an overall balance of supply and demand, the supply of battery-grade products may still be constrained,\" the IEA said.\n\nIn addition, new projects often come with higher costs, exerting upwards pressure on pricing.\n\nAlthough prices of some critical minerals such as copper have eased over the last year due to recession in the \"old economy\", prices for most critical minerals remain well above historical averages as supply struggles to catch up with demand.\n\nThe IEA's clean energy equipment index, tracking costs of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, fell consistently between 2014 and 2020 but has since broken that downtrend as raw material inputs push up overall manufacturing costs.\n\nProduction trends for nickel and cobalt\nProduction trends for nickel and cobalt\nLIMITED DIVERSIFICATION\nThere has been only limited success in diversifying the geographical sourcing of critical minerals in recent years, the IEA said.\n\nWhat progress has been made has come largely at the mining stage of the production chain.\n\nThe processing segment of the chain has actually become more concentrated as incumbent players consolidate their dominant position.\n\n\"Compared with the situation three years ago, the share of the top three producers in 2022 either remains unchanged or has increased further, especially for nickel and cobalt,\" the IEA noted.\n\nChina, which already dominates lithium processing, accounts for half of the world's planned new lithium chemical plants. Indonesia, which has emerged as the world's largest nickel producer over the last decade, will host nearly 90% of planned nickel refining projects.\n\n\"The world has not yet successfully connected the dots to build diversified midstream supply chains,\" the IEA said.\n\nMoreover, China's move to control exports of gallium and germanium underlines the concentration of supply in a host of smaller, esoteric metals that feed into the critical minerals landscape.\n\nOther minerals such as magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and silicon are all niche products but vulnerable to disruption due to a high reliance on a limited number of suppliers.\n\nDespite increasingly strenuous efforts by the United States and Europe to diversify supply chains, \"all countries rely on a functioning global market for critical materials and related technologies,\" according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n\n\"Each critical material has a unique geography of trade which, on an aggregate level, entangles countries in a broader web of interdependence,\" IRENA noted in a just-released report titled \"Geopolitics of the Energy Transition\" .\n\nESG CHALLENGE\nThe IEA's assessment of progress on environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures across 20 key companies shows headway being made on community investment, health and safety, and gender equality.\n\nHowever, \"environmental indicators are not improving at the same rate,\" it warned.\n\nThe sector's greenhouse gas emissions remain high while water withdrawals almost doubled from 2018 to 2021.\n\nESG issues have become a key determinant of new supply in the form of local push-back against both mining and processing projects.\n\nIRENA estimates that 54% of energy transition minerals are located on or near Indigenous peoples' land, the percentage rising to over 80% in the case of lithium projects.\n\nAround half of the world's copper and lithium production is concentrated in high water-stress areas, including the lithium triangle in South America, according to IRENA.\n\nPotential conflicts over both land and water rights feed back into the new supply equation in the form of delays at the permitting stage of any project.\n\nCOULD DO BETTER\nThis is the IEA's first major update on green transition metals and, like the IRENA report, it is an attempt to understand the three-way challenge of producing enough of them to meet carbon reduction targets, simultaneously diversifying supply and doing it all in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nThere's quite a lot of good news on the first part but considerably less on the second and the third, particularly when it comes to Western countries' ability to scale up their own supply chains in the face of environmental opposition.\n\nIndeed, the risk of minerals conflict appears to have moved up a notch after China flexed its critical metal muscles in the niche gallium and germanium markets.\n\nThere is potential for many more clashes in areas such as deep-sea and Arctic mining. Both are new frontiers for metals production but each is heavily disputed, both geopolitically and environmentally.\n\nIf it were a school report, the IEA's first annual assessment of the critical minerals sector would be headlined: \"Has made solid progress this year but still much room for improvement.\"\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Global supply chain disruptions following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the rapid rise in U.S. inflation over the past two years. Evidence suggests that supply chain pressures pushed up the cost of inputs for goods production and the public\u2019s expectations of higher future prices. These factors accounted for about 60% of the surge in U.S. inflation beginning in early 2021. Supply chain pressures began easing substantially in mid-2022, contributing to the slowdown in inflation.\n\nFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, global shipping and transportation costs surged, and delivery times and backlogs spiked to historically high levels. The resulting supply shortages added significant pressure to inflation.\n\nThis Economic Letter examines the quantitative contribution of global supply chain disruptions to the run-up of U.S. inflation during the past two years. Our evidence suggests that an increase in supply chain pressures can lead to a sizable increase in overall personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation. Supply chain disruptions increase input costs and raise the public\u2019s expectations for higher prices. We estimate that these effects contributed about 60% of the above-trend run-up of headline inflation in 2021 and 2022.\n\nMeasuring global supply chain pressures\nWe measure supply chain disruptions using the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Akinci et al. 2022). The GSCPI summarizes information from 27 monthly indicators of transportation costs\u2014such as the Baltic Dry Index, the Harpex index, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics airfreight cost indexes\u2014and supply chain-related components from the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index surveys for manufacturing firms in seven major economies, including China, the euro area, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nFigure 1 shows the GSCPI (blue line) from January 1997 to April 2023. The GSCPI is normalized to have an average value of zero over the full time series. The vertical axis indicates how many standard deviations the index is above or below the average. As global supply conditions change, the GSCPI fluctuates around its average level. For example, the spike in 2011 reflects disruptions to automobile production and distribution following Japan\u2019s Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The index climbed again in 2017, following the China\u2013U.S. trade disputes. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the GSCPI jumped to unprecedented levels, over four standard deviations above its average value by the end of 2021. Since mid-2022, supply chain pressures have eased steadily, with the GSCPI gradually returning to its historical average.\n\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Pressure Index and PCE inflation\nSource: FRB New York, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and authors\u2019 calculations. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\n\nMovements in the GSCPI are modestly correlated with those in headline PCE inflation (green line), with a correlation of about 0.53 over the full sample. This correlation partly reflects the surges in both series during the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic sample (1997\u20132019), the correlation was much lower, about 0.24. In estimating the effects of changes in the GSCPI on inflation, we focus on the pre-pandemic sample period from 1998 to 2019, to ensure that our findings would not be driven by the special pandemic conditions.\n\nHow does inflation respond to supply chain shocks?\nThe correlation between inflation and the GSCPI reflects the combined effects of a variety of factors. To isolate the effects of changes in supply chain constraints on inflation, we first identify a GSCPI shock, which measures unexpected changes in the GSCPI that are not explained by fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions. In particular, our estimation controls for changes in aggregate demand conditions, measured by six-month lags of the unemployment gap, and in monetary policy, measured by two-year U.S. Treasury yields.\n\nWe use the local projections method\u2014a statistical tool proposed by Jord\u00e0 (2005)\u2014to project how inflation responds over time to a surprise increase in the GSCPI of one standard deviation above its average level. The size of this GSCPI shock is relatively modest compared with the sharp increase in the GSCPI during the pandemic.\n\nFigure 2 shows the average response of headline PCE inflation to a surprise GSCPI increase of one standard deviation relative to its average value (blue line). It also shows the confidence band (blue shading), indicating statistical uncertainty in estimating the responses. Assuming that the model is correctly specified, the shaded area contains the actual value of the inflation response to the GSCPI shock roughly two-thirds of the time.\n\nFigure 2\nResponses of headline PCE inflation to GSCPI shocks\n\nResponses of headline PCE inflation to GSCPI shocks\nNote: Blue shading indicates 68% confidence band.\n\nThe figure illustrates that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI leads to an increase in headline PCE inflation of about 0.5 percentage point at the peak. The effects are relatively short lived, statistically vanishing about a year after the impact.\n\nSince supply chain disruptions directly constrain supplies of traded goods, with only indirect effects on services, one would expect a GSCPI shock to boost goods price inflation more than overall inflation. This is the case in our model results. We find that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI raises PCE goods inflation by up to 1.5 percentage points relative to the pre-shock level, about three times the peak effect on overall inflation.\n\nWe also find that a GSCPI shock raises unemployment, suggesting that it acts like an adverse supply shock that raises inflation but reduces economic activity. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI raises the unemployment rate by up to 0.7 percentage point relative to the pre-shock level. These findings are in line with empirical studies of the effects of global supply chain disruptions on inflation and economic activity in the euro area (see, for example, Finck and Tillmann 2023).\n\nHow supply chain constraints can affect inflation\nA surprise increase in the GSCPI can raise inflation through several channels.\n\nThe first channel works through inflation expectations. Disruptions to global supply chains are often associated with surges in commodity prices. Studies have shown that people\u2019s inflation expectations\u2014especially for short-term, one-year ahead inflation\u2014are sensitive to commodity price fluctuations (see, for example, Glick et al. 2021). We examine the responses of one-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Philadelphia Fed\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) following surprise changes in the GSCPI. We find that a shock that raises the GSCPI one standard deviation increases SPF short-term inflation expectations by up to 0.1 percentage point. This estimate suggests that a shock that raises the GSCPI four standard deviations above its mean, as observed from late 2020 to late 2021, would increase one-year-ahead inflation expectations by up to 0.4 percentage point, or about 40% of the actual increase in the SPF short-term inflation expectations during the same period\u2014that is, from 2.1% in the first quarter of 2021 to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of a GSCPI shock on long-term SPF inflation expectations, such as for 10 years ahead, are more muted.\n\nThe second channel works through import prices. A tightening of supply chain constraints can raise imported goods prices, which are then passed through to consumer prices. Using a similar local projections model, we estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI raises inflation for imported goods by up to 0.9 percentage point at the peak. However, since the share of imported goods makes up only about 5% of total PCE, the pass-through from the import price channel to final consumer price inflation is likely to be limited.\n\nThe third channel works through the costs of intermediate inputs. In response to supply chain disruptions, businesses would pass increases in intermediate input costs through to consumer prices. We use a similar local projections model to examine the quantitative importance of this channel. We find that a one standard deviation GSCPI shock raises 12-month changes in the producer price index (PPI) of crude materials by up to 10 percentage points. The same shock raises intermediate materials PPI inflation to a smaller extent, about 3.5 percentage points at the peak. The effects on finished goods PPI inflation are even smaller, about 2.5 percentage points. Thus, a GSCPI shock raises input prices significantly. However, as costs move further along the production chain, from initial inputs to intermediate goods, PPI inflation becomes less sensitive to a GSCPI shock. The effects of the shock on final consumer goods inflation are even more muted, as shown in Figure 1. This \u201csnake effect,\u201d whereby the impact of the shock dissipates as it works its way through the supply chain, is consistent with economic theory (see, for example, Huang and Liu 2001).\n\nContributions of GSCPI shocks to recent inflation\nTo assess the quantitative contributions of GSCPI shocks to the run-up of PCE inflation in the past two years, we use a structural vector-autoregression model that takes into account the joint dynamics between the GSCPI, inflation, and the control variables for demand conditions and monetary policy. We estimate the model using data from January 1998 to March 2023, and then compute the contributions of GSCPI shocks to the deviations of inflation from its sample average. This GSCPI-driven inflation is the predicted path of PCE inflation from our model, assuming that it has only been affected by shocks to the GSCPI.\n\nFigure 3 shows headline PCE inflation (gray line) separated into three components: trend inflation (green bars), contributions of the GSCPI (blue bars), and contributions of other factors (gold bars) from April 2021 to March 2023. During this period, GSCPI shocks contributed on average about 60% of the above-trend run-up of headline inflation. Our finding here is in line with recent analysis by Shapiro (2022), using a different methodology.\n\nFigure 3\nContributions of supply chain shocks to recent PCE inflation\n\nContributions of supply chain shocks to recent PCE inflation\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and authors\u2019 calculations.\n\nSince mid-2022, the contributions of GSCPI shocks have declined from 2.5 to 1.4 percentage points, and headline inflation has also slowed, reflecting the recent easing of supply chain constraints. Although the GSCPI fell back closer to its historical average around the beginning of this year (see Figure 1), the contribution of the GSCPI shock to inflation remains positive, reflecting the delayed effects of the shock on inflation.\n\nConclusion\nSupply shortages caused by global supply chain disruptions following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have added pressure on U.S. inflation. Our analysis suggests that supply chain shocks can have significant impacts on PCE inflation by raising inflation expectations and intermediate input costs. We estimate that supply chain disruptions contributed on average about 60% of the run-up of U.S. inflation during the past two years. Since mid-2022, indicators show that increased pressure from the supply chain disruptions have been easing gradually, which has contributed to the slowdown in inflation.\n\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}

{"text":"Cineworld Group Plc today filed a disclosure statement and plan of reorganization as the company took steps to bring its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to a conclusion. Cineworld filed for Chapter 11 on Sept. 7, 2022 in the Southern District of Texas (Houston).\n\nThe reorganization plan follows the outline agreed to by the company and an ad hoc group of lenders on April 2 and detailed in a restructuring support agreement (RSA). The company said today that, as with the RSA, the filed reorganization plan has the support of holders of 83% of the company\u2019s $3.9 billion of debt under its \u201clegacy facilities\u201d (namely term loans due 2025 and 2026 along with a revolver due 2023) and holders of 69% of its $1.94 billion DIP facility. The official creditors\u2019 committee is also on board.\n\nVoting on the plan documented by the disclosure statement is scheduled to end on May 23. The confirmation hearing is set for May 26.\n\nIn general, the plan is for Cineworld to reduce its outstanding debt by around $4.53 billion. The plan sees the company raising $1.46 billion in new first-lien exit financing, plus $800 million to be generated by selling 72.32% of newly issued common stock (before management incentive plan dilution), $400 million of which will be backstopped by legacy facility debt holders. Cineworld will also enter into a new $200 million revolver.\n\nRegarding recoveries, the DIP loan now in place will be repaid in full, in cash. Legacy facility claims will receive projected recoveries of around 3.4%, according to the disclosure statement. General unsecured claims will receive recoveries of 0.5-1.3%, while holders of interests in the Cineworld parent company, including common stock, will receive no recovery, the document shows. A $10 million litigation trust is also being established.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy, Cineworld embarked on a sales process in an attempt to sell some, or all, of its assets. The company received no all-cash bids for the entire business. Cineworld, its advisers and an ad hoc lender group believed that only an all-cash bid for the entire business \u201csignificantly in excess of the valuations underpinning the [RSA] transactions\u201d would be of greater interest than the restructuring now documented by the filed plan of reorganization, according to the disclosure statement. \n\nBut the sales process is continuing for the company\u2019s \u201crest of world\u201d business, including operations in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Israel. That process expected binding offers to be submitted by April 10, and foresees bidding procedures set by April 24, an auction on May 10 if multiple bids are received, and a definitive agreement signed two days later. The reorganization plan assumes the new exit financing facility will be reduced by net sales proceeds, if any.","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a challenge by President Joe Biden's administration to the legality of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, putting on hold a deal that would shield its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits over their role in the country's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe justices paused bankruptcy proceedings concerning Purdue and its affiliates and said they would hold oral arguments in December in the administration's appeal of a lower court's ruling upholding the settlement. The Supreme Court's new term begins in October.\n\nPurdue's owners under the settlement would receive immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed by states, hospitals, people who had become addicted and others who have sued the Stamford, Connecticut-based company over its misleading marketing of the powerful pain medication OxyContin.\n\nIn a statement, Purdue said it was disappointed that the U.S. Trustee, the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog that filed the challenge at the Supreme Court, has been able to \"single-handedly delay billions of dollars in value that should be put to use for victim compensation, opioid crisis abatement for communities across the country and overdose rescue medicines.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the legality of our nearly universally supported plan of reorganization, and optimistic that the Supreme Court will agree,\" the company added.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nAt issue is whether U.S. bankruptcy law allows Purdue's restructuring to include legal protections for the members of the Sackler family, who have not filed for personal bankruptcy.\n\nPurdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 to address its debts, nearly all of which stemmed from thousands of lawsuits alleging that OxyContin helped kickstart an opioid epidemic that has caused more than 500,000 U.S. overdose deaths over two decades.\n\nPurdue estimates that its bankruptcy settlement, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in 2021, would provide $10 billion in value to its creditors, including state and local governments, individual victims of addiction, hospitals, and others who have sued the company.\n\nThe Biden administration and eight states challenged the settlement, but all of the states dropped their opposition after the Sacklers agreed to contribute more to the settlement fund.\n\nIn May, the 2nd Circuit upheld the settlement, concluding that federal bankruptcy law allows legal protections for non-bankrupt parties like the Sacklers in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit ruled that the legal claims against Purdue were inextricably linked to claims against its owners, and that allowing lawsuits to continue targeting the Sacklers would undermine Purdue's efforts to reach a bankruptcy settlement.\n\nMembers of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing but expressed regret that OxyContin \"unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.\" They said in May that the bankruptcy settlement would provide \"substantial resources for people and communities in need.\"\n\nIn a court filing, the administration told the Supreme Court that Purdue's settlement is an abuse of bankruptcy protections meant for debtors in \"financial distress,\" not people like the Sacklers. According to the administration, Sackler family members withdrew $11 billion from Purdue before agreeing to contribute $6 billion to its opioid settlement.\n\nMany other stakeholders have responded in opposition to the administration's request to halt the settlement.\n\nA group comprising more than 60,000 people who have filed personal injury claims stemming from their exposure to Purdue opioid products told the Supreme Court they support the settlement, including legal immunity for members of the Sackler family.\n\n\"Regardless of how one feels about the role of the Sackler family in the creation and escalation of the opioid crisis,\" the group told the justices, \"the fact remains that the billions of dollars in abatement and victim compensation funds hinge on confirmation and consummation of the existing plan.\"","labels":["financial_distress"]}

He is a fellow at Princeton University, Singularity University, Bosch Academy, the Chicago Council for Global Affairs and the World Economic Forum. His latest book is Terra Incognita: 100 Maps to Survive the Next 100 Years. He received his PhD at the University of Oxford.\n\nMac Margolis is a research editor at the Igarap\u00e9 Institute and columnist with The Washington Post. He is the author of The Last New World: The Conquest of the Amazon Frontier.\n\nEven before Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva assumed office on Jan. 1, he was steeling himself for a national emergency. From cratered riverbanks and escalating violence to deadly pathogens on Indigenous lands, wildcat gold prospectors had left their devastating mark on the Amazon basin. Waved on by former President Jair Bolsonaro between 2019 and 2022, they helped nudge Brazil closer to the status of global pariah.\n\nLula wasted no time, immediately revoking two of his predecessor's executive orders that had sped up irregular gold mining. He went on to dispatch security forces to evict the miners from besieged Yanomami territory, sanctioned a provisional decree to crack down on the purchase of illegal gold, and set aside more than 2,300 square miles as protected Indigenous land. In early May, he sent three ministers to the region to assess the damage.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBrazil's latest rhetorical pivot from plunder to preservation drew accolades at home and abroad. At the COP27 climate conference last year, Lula declared Brazil was back as a climate champion and would not tolerate any illegal deforestation. Whether the world's largest tropical forest can survive Lula's broader ambitions \u2014 to remake his country into a regional power broker, bolster the clout of developing countries and help ring in a new multipolar world order \u2014 is another matter.\n\nA Brazilian road project cuts through the Amazon, paving the way to vast deforestation\nWORLD\nA Brazilian road project cuts through the Amazon, paving the way to vast deforestation\nLittle more than four months in office, Lula has crossed continents and oceans, calling on President Biden in Washington and Xi Jinping in Beijing. His hyperactive diplomacy is part of a wider Brazilian campaign to show that Latin America's largest country is beholden to neither the United States or China and will blaze its own nonaligned path. To press the point, Lula has sent emissaries to meet with Russia, dissed the faltering U.S. dollar, talked up doing business in China's yuan currency, and offered to set up a \"peace club\" to resolve the war in Ukraine.\n\nLula's boosters argue this is nothing more than diplomatic boilerplate for strengthening the hand of nations of the so-called Global South. But here's the paradox. Owing to geopolitical uncertainty, Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, a simmering U.S. and European banking crisis and wider global recession concerns, the dollar has tumbled on international markets. And as the greenback slides, gold \u2014 that age-old safe harbor of security and wealth in troubled times \u2014 has soared.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHaving risen nearly sixfold in the last 20 years, the troy ounce recently breached $2,000 and may reach $2,200 by year's end. Central banks are leading the scramble for gold; nine of the top 10 official buyers are in the developing world, including Brazil. Cue the acceleration of the 21st century Amazon gold rush, and with it, an even steeper challenge for Lula, whose global ambitions may well ride on the fate of the rainforest.\n\nWord travels fast in gold country. Every fluctuation in the price of the precious metal sends new waves of prospectors streaming to the hinterland, especially the states that make up the so-called Legal Amazon in Brazil. In recent years, tens of thousands of gold miners have diffused across the Brazilian Amazon (20,000 of them in Yanomami territory alone), many using mercury to extract the precious metal, spewing the toxic substance into rivers in the process. Artisanal gold mines (garimpos) expanded at three times the rate of industrial mines from 2010 to 2020, overtaking the land area for corporate prospecting in the Amazon.\n\nIn Roraima, a gold rush state in Brazil's far north, the number of gold brokers, smiths and jewelers has exploded in recent years. The frenzy is facilitated by the region's notoriously lax oversight, overstretched state institutions, local corruption and feeble command and control in mining regions. So even as authorities order episodic raids and inspections in the region, fortune hunters and their deep-pocketed sponsors decide the prize is worth the risk. Little wonder that clandestine airstrips and wildcat mining have multiplied in the nine states that make up Brazil's Amazon, with garimpos alone expanding 632% on vulnerable Indigenous lands from 2010 to 2021.\n\nIllegal mining may not be the biggest environmental threat to the Amazon basin. Clear-cutting the forest for cattle, bootleg timber operations and land-grabbing are by far the region's leading drivers of deforestation, which has spiked in recent years and now threatens to push the world's signature tropical forest beyond the ecological tipping point of regrowth and natural recovery.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYet the dirty secret of the Amazon is that predation isn't just an accumulation of transgressions but an ecosystem of criminality with interdependent accomplices who flourish in the shadows, studies by the Igarap\u00e9 Institute have shown. Beyond the prospector is an elaborate web of buyers, sellers, suppliers, financiers and middlemen, many who conspire to usurp the rule of law for private gain.\n\nAsk the Brazilian authorities who are struggling to crack down on illegal gold miners and their moneyed enablers. A recent writ before the Brazilian Supreme Court shows that, between 2021 and 2022, federal police launched 92 raids, which rendered 1,527 investigations into illegal gold prospecting and trade. Federal police found that roughly 30% of all the gold produced in Brazil is illegal, that production has spiked on nominally off-limits Indigenous land and conservation units, and that the whole enterprise is built on fraudulent financial certificates.\n\nOpinion: A violent tragedy foretold in the Amazon\nOPINION\nOpinion: A violent tragedy foretold in the Amazon\nMuch of the Amazon free-for-all is rightly attributed to Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who, during his 2019-2022 term, pandered to Amazon miners, timbermen and ranchers by easing environmental restrictions and scaling back inspections and policing. Yet the recent gold rush also owes to earlier measures to stimulate the Amazon economy by eliminating bureaucratic controls. Consider Law 12.844, a sprawling bill, signed in 2013 by then-President Dilma Rousseff, of Lula's Workers Party, which authorized the purchase, sale and transport of gold from artisanal mines, under the thinnest of pretenses. By signing an affidavit of good faith, miners, brokers and jewelers could bypass official oversight institutions to offer garimpo gold directly on the open market. At the end of April, the Brazilian court overturned that rule.\n\nOpinion: Brazil's President Is A Global Health Threat\nTHE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS\nOpinion: Bolsonaro is a global health threat\nSuch lenience, in the name of slashing red tape and job creation, created a regulatory fast lane for dirty gold by relaxing controls over buyers and sellers. In the process it weakened the \"traceability of gold production and commerce, increasing opportunities for illicit practices,\" the federal police's Amazon and environment division concluded last month.\n\nThe new Lula government did the right thing not just by clamping down on the legions of wildcat miners but also in targeting the shadowy network of buyers and sellers who work the institutional blind spots, co-opt local officials and game the porous legal code to trade in tainted gold. Recent investigations show that much of this gold finds its way to foreign buyers, including in the U.S. and the Arab Gulf states.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTaking back the Amazon from bad-faith dealers and resource pirates who profit by putting rainforest inhabitants in jeopardy is crucial to restore Brazil's tarnished sovereignty and rule of law. That Lula's wider geopolitical ambitions for Brazil in a de-dollarized, multipolar world order could also help usher in the next Amazon gold rush also shows just how complicated that mission will be.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Beneficient, a Dallas financial services company, hired the same law firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems in the high-profile lawsuit against Fox News to file a defamation lawsuit against a Wall Street Journal reporter.\n\nLawyers from Clare Locke on Friday filed a defamation lawsuit in U.S. District Court in East Texas on behalf of Beneficient and its founder and CEO Brad Heppner asking for undisclosed compensatory and punitive damages over a social media post and series of articles published over the past year in the newspaper by staff writer Alexander Gladstone.\n\n\nThe Journal published a story on Friday that quoted private documents it viewed that showed Beneficient was using a faulty accounting method that would misstate revenue and showed payments went to Heppner\u2019s nearly 1,500-acre ranch in East Texas. The Journal said that in 2019, chief financial officer Tiffany Kice, made the discoveries and left the company. Three board members and other c-suite executives left the company within months.\n\nGWG Holdings, a company that invested in Beneficient, defaulted on $2 billion in debt last year and filed bankruptcy, leaving individual investors with as much as $1.3 billion in potential losses, the article reported.\n\nThe Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. and Murdoch is chairman of Fox Corp., which settled a two-year lawsuit in April by paying Dominion $787 million, believed to be a record settlement in a media case, to end the legal battle over the network spreading lies about the 2020 election.\n\nBeneficient said in its complaint that \u201cGladstone has purposefully disregarded critical facts, distorted critical timelines and cherry-picked the information he has received to promote an overarching, pre-ordained conclusion: Brad Heppner, through his control of Beneficient and other companies, engineered self-serving transaction to enrich himself \u2013 and maintain a so-called \u2018lavish lifestyle\u2019 \u2013 at the expense of vulnerable and elderly \u2018retail\u2019 investors.\u201d\n\nThe complaint went on to say that Heppner can prove the statement is false and that Gladstone published his stories with \u201cmalice.\u201d\n\nGladstone hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment and The Journal declined to comment. Beneficient declined to comment.\n\nA tweet from Gladstone a year ago called out Heppner\u2019s ranch in Anderson County saying its debt was funded by transfers from Beneficient and its former parent company, GWG Holdings, which is in the process of a bankruptcy court-led reorganization.\n\nOther prominent Twitter accounts piled on with likes and replies, according to Beneficient\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cGladstone\u2019s Twitter audience \u2014 and others in the community \u2014 have taken Gladstone\u2019s allegations at face value and now believe that Heppner and Beneficient acted improperly,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nHeppner purchased the Bradley Oaks Ranch in 2003, according to the lawsuit, which noted that was 16 years before GWG started investing what ended up being a total of $230 million in Beneficient.\n\nBeneficient disclosed in its annual filing that on June 29 the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the company and Heppner that the agency\u2019s staff had made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file a civil enforcement action against the company, alleging SEC violations relating to Beneficient\u2019s association with GWG.\n\nBeneficient had a partnership with GWG before separating into an independent company in November 2021, the lawsuit said. Heppner joined the GWG board in April 2019 as chairman, but the lawsuit says that he was not a member of the special committees that decided to invest in Beneficient.\n\nGWG, which issued high-yield bonds that financed the purchase of life insurance policies on the secondary market, filed for bankruptcy in April 2022 after it missed interest payments to bondholders. GWG had previously disclosed that the SEC was investigating its accounting practices, according to regulatory filings.\n\nCurrent and former Beneficient and GWG board members are high-profile individuals including two former Federal Reserve Bank district presidents. Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach who built a large commercial real estate company is no longer a board member.\n\nFormer Dallas Fed Bank president Richard Fisher, former Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and leverage buyout financier Tom Hicks are current Beneficient directors.\n\n\nFriday\u2019s article in The Journal said Fisher, Lockhart and others have been accused in court filings \u201cof facilitating a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Heppner.\u201d\n\nBeneficient went public in June after it was acquired last year by Avalon Acquisition with the intention of taking it public through its SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company structure. Beneficient ended up raising about $8 million from the IPO, according to The Journal.","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"Labor shortages are plaguing high-stakes sectors like law enforcement, health care and aviation.\n\nWhy it matters: Understaffing in some industries can have dire consequences for public health and safety \u2014 for example, a shortage of air traffic controllers has led to increase in near-miss airplane collisions, the New York Times recently reported.\n\nAt the same time, a lack of available workers in AI and manufacturing threatens to slow productivity and growth in areas where the U.S. is otherwise poised for huge leaps forward.\nThat's a problem not just for companies in those sectors, but for the broader economy.\n\nSchools across the country are understaffed, without enough teachers, bus drivers, or social workers.\nThe child care industry is also dealing with a shortage of available workers. Parents often either can't find care or can't afford it, which can cause them to stay on the sidelines of the labor force \u2014 making the worker shortage that much worse.\nPolice departments are also struggling to hire.\n\nSo are prisons \u2014 21% of correctional officer positions were unstaffed in federal prisons, according to a March report. A staffing shortage throughout the Bureau of Prisons is increasing incidents of violence and leading to more health issues for prisoners.\nHow it works: Americans are getting older, and there are fewer younger people of working age. Add to that a tight labor market \u2014 unemployment in the U.S. is very low \u2014 and there simply aren't enough workers in the U.S. to meet demand.\n\nSome of these high-stakes shortages are about wages. Government jobs, like teaching and law enforcement, typically can't raise pay high enough to compete with better-paying private sector jobs.\nSome of them are about working conditions: Employers trying to fill in-person, high-stress roles are competing with jobs that offer more flexibility, including remote options.\nAnd some of them are about skills: There are only so many people with a ton of expertise creating AI programs, for example. That's the problem in nursing, too.\n\nWhat we're watching: For workers, this isn't a crisis. A tight labor market means higher pay, better benefits and more congenial employers.\n\nUPS likely wouldn't have given such a generous contract to its unionized workforce \u2014 with some drivers earning $170,000 a year \u2014 if not for the tight labor market.\nPlenty of employers have figured out ways to adjust to this new normal \u2014 particularly in industries like retail and restaurants.\n\nThey've raised pay significantly, are relying more on automation (think self-checkouts gaining popularity), or cut their hours, or have made it work with some combination of those tactics.\nBut not every sector can take these steps. A lot of employers can raise wages and attract what workers are available, but the sectors facing these high-stakes shortages don't necessarily have that option.\nThe bottom line: Absent a surge in immigration, a surprise flood of sidelined women into the workforce, or a recession that drives down demand for employees, demographic changes mean that labor shortages will likely stick around.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

They don\u2019t care about passengers, or Britain\u2019s railway, but they will not break us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTrain drivers at these companies have not had a pay rise for four years, since 2019, while inflation has rocketed, We haven\u2019t heard a word from the employers \u2013 we haven\u2019t had a meeting, a phone call, a text message, or an email \u2013 since 26 April and we haven\u2019t had any contact with the government since 6 January.\u201d\n\n\nIt will be the 12th one-day strike by Aslef members since the dispute started more than a year ago. A series of overtime bans by drivers have caused disruption on the rail network over the summer, including from 3 July to 8 July, from 31 July to 5 August and from 7 to 12 August.\nWhelan warned of further industrial action if the deadlocked row continued, saying Aslef members were pressing the union to go \u201charder and faster\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: \u201cFurther strike action by the Aslef leadership is unnecessary and will cause more disruption to passengers looking to enjoy various sporting events and the end of the summer holidays.\n\n\u201cThe union leadership has its head in the sand and refuses to put our fair and reasonable offer to their members.

{"text":"Aside from the record death toll from the Ebola outbreak in Africa, businesses around the globe will be affected by the pandemic, with the mining, agricultural and energy sectors most at risk of having their businesses disrupted.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even companies that don\u2019t have operations in the affected areas might have suppliers there who have to shut down, making disruption of transportation and supply networks a potential problem for many other organizations.\n\nThe outbreak that began in Guinea and spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria had claimed more than 1,100 lives by the end of last week, prompting quarantines, flight cancellations and business disruptions.\n\n\u201cFrom a corporate risk management perspective, the issue is usually how to reduce illness and avoid business disruption,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, London-based head of population risk and data analytics research and development at Swiss Re Ltd.\n\nJohn Rose, Annapolis, Maryland-based chief operating officer of risk management information and consulting firm iJET International Inc., said travel and logistical networks are particularly sensitive to disruption by a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn area impacted by Ebola, you are seeing a serious reduction in air traffic,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cNo airline is going to fly a wide body jet to Africa if only nine passengers are aboard, so you have to have a plan B to move your assets around.\u201d\n\nQuarantines and border closings also affect employees and supply chains, said Kimberly Hale, a senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Chicago.\n\n\n\u201cCompanies need to keep in mind that if they are sending people to affected regions, borders can close at the drop of a hat,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nMining, agricultural and energy companies tend to have large operations in the African nations, so they now are bearing the brunt of the Ebola pandemic.\n\nFor example, Luxembourg-based steelmaker and mining firm ArcelorMittal S.A. last week said contractors working on expanding an iron ore mining site in Liberia had declared force majeure and were moving workers out of the country, shutting the project down.\n\nIn a statement, ArcelorMittal said it had taken steps to protect employees and operations, including providing thermoflash scanners to test employees and visitors for fevers at all its Liberia locations, personal protective equipment to hospitals and clinics, and training to health care workers and employees.\n\nJason Jarrett, Vancouver, British Columbia-based chief adviser for global business resilience, global security with Rio Tinto Group, said the London-based mining company, which has extensive operations in Guinea, put in place appropriate steps to minimize the risks when the Ebola outbreak was first detected in March.\n\nThe company enhanced medical support for its people, Mr. Jarrett said, noting that all Rio Tinto staff in Guinea receive regular briefings with the latest medical advice and those visiting are fully briefed on arrival. Rio Tinto is also providing sanitation supplies such as soap and chlorine to the communities in which its people live and work.\n\n\u201cTo support the work of the Government of Guinea and Doctors Without Borders in fighting the disease, we are distributing prevention kits, organizing public awareness campaigns and providing sanitation equipment such as shovels, rakes and refuse bins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also constructed some latrines in one of the main towns to help improve hygiene.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Jarrett said that while Rio Tinto has not stopped the movement of its people in, out or around Guinea, it is ensuring that travel is only for essential purposes.\n\nChris Baudouin, Chicago-based CEO of the Aon Global Client Network, said an aggressive employee safety approach is warranted.\n\n\u201cA lot of our clients are mining operations, which tend to have assets in remote areas and limited access to health care and transportation,\u201d Mr. Baudouin said. \u201cSo they tend to err on the side on caution, especially if airlines are shutting down flights.\u201d\n\nTo remain abreast of the situation, Susan Morton, senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Boston, said it\u2019s important for businesses to have pandemic, crisis response and business continuity plans in place, and closely follow guidance from organizations such as the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere also are also dedicated, real-time third-party risk monitoring services available.\n\nMichael Kiewski, Chicago-based director of Aon\u2019s Crisis Operations Center, said his staff provides risk managers with real-time information from the company\u2019s crisis centers in Chicago and South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are taking open information from media and social media, analyzing it and sending it out to our risk manager clients,\u201d Mr. Kiewski said. \u201cWe are watching which airlines cancel flights and which countries are shutting down borders.\u201d\n\nCompanies with workers within the affected areas also face pressure from workers\u2019 families and adverse media attention that can tarnish their corporate reputation.\n\n\u201cStranding employees exposes you to lawsuits,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real risk.\u201d\n\nCompanies that do extract employees from affected areas of Africa still need to bear in mend Ebola\u2019s lengthy incubation period and plan accordingly. \u201cYou can leave Sierra Leone or Guinea and be perfectly fine and three weeks later come down with it,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nIndeed, to reduce the risk of transmission, Mr. Jarrett said Rio Tinto has asked workers who have visited the highest-risk areas to stay at home up to 21 days before returning to work.\n\nGeoff Taylor, London-based executive director at Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. said the pandemic highlights the need for companies to focus on supply chain resiliency.\n\n\u201cYou might be able to withstand the loss of one factory, but what if you lose a key port or have an entire country subject quarantines or sanctions?\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have single-source suppliers or several concentrated in a certain region, it is good to contemplate what your options are.\u201d","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"Easing supply-chain pressures haven\u2019t come fast enough to pull the maker of the popular Instant Pot cooker and Pyrex glassware out of a financial tailspin brought on by pandemic-driven turmoil. \n\nInstant Brands filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month with its balance sheet crumpled by the high costs of keeping its supply chain running even as demand for its products, standbys in many American kitchens, soared and then slumped in rapidly changing consumer markets. \n\nThe company is seeking to restructure debt that includes tens of millions of dollars owed to manufacturers in China and some $320,000 to various unnamed logistics providers, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. It lists United Parcel Service, to which it owes $802,274, and Packaging Corp. of America, at $765,167, among its top 30 unsecured creditors. \n\nThe company said in its filing that it faced \u201cunprecedented liquidity challenges, which have accelerated dramatically over the past months driven by severely tightened credit terms with suppliers, rising interest rates, continued inflation and a shifting in Instant Brands\u2019 historical distribution channels in North America, while supply chain issues persisted.\u201d\n\nThe Logistics Report\n\nTop news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.\n\nSupply-chain experts said Instant Brands\u2019 woes show how many retailers and manufacturers, particularly smaller operators without big capital cushions, are still coping with the financial overhang of the turmoil during the pandemic. International shipping costs, for instance, surged some 10-fold in 2021 from prepandemic levels and have only receded this year. \n\nRetailers have a lot of inventory that they purchased and imported at high rates and have shipping contracts negotiated during a period of high prices, \u201cso that now maybe some of the cost increases are starting to come through,\u201d said Lisa Ellram, a supply-chain management professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nThe Downers Grove, Ill.-based company\u2019s Instant Pot became a hit early in the pandemic as locked-down Americans turned to the all-in-one kitchen gadget to cook more meals at home. \n\nBut consumer demand shifted just as port closures, shipping backlogs and soaring freight costs tangled the company\u2019s supply chain. As overstuffed freight transportation channels started to crack and delays spread, lead times for ordering everything from raw materials to finished goods lengthened. Instant Brands said in its filing that it ordered parts further in advance and raised its prices to help offset those costs, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2021, a supply chain perfect storm unfolded,\u201d the company said in its bankruptcy filing. \n\nInstant Brands faced more challenges last year as retailers, overstocked with items consumers no longer wanted, slashed orders.

{"text":"Congress and the Biden administration are weighing various legislative and executive actions to ban TikTok, a social media platform with approximately 150 million US users. However, broad restrictions on TikTok or future non-US communication platforms could carry long-term implications for free speech, global data transfers, and US-China relations. Instead of banning TikTok, the United States could benefit from comprehensive rules to address digital privacy, algorithmic profiling, and content moderation across the entire technology ecosystem.\n\nIn March 2023, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reportedly recommended banning or divesting from TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China. This marked the latest sign that US-China relations are on an unmistakable downward trajectory. The bilateral relationship had worsened between 2017 to 2020 for a variety of reasons, including China\u2019s response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detention of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang. Former President Trump was an instigating factor as well; he imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports, popularized controversial rhetoric including the \u201cChina virus,\u201d and even suggested that a TikTok ban was partially motivated by retribution for COVID-19.\n\nWhen President Biden took office in 2021, it was not initially clear whether he would act to either heighten or de-escalate competitive tensions. Towards the beginning of his term, Biden revoked Trump\u2019s 2020 executive order to block the popular social media app in order to assess the stated security risks and adopted more diplomatic language in general. Yet, his administration recently embarked on a series of more hawkish actions, including restricting semiconductors exports to China in October 2022 and doubling down on Trump\u2019s TikTok ban in March 2023. Members of Congress have also introduced a range of bills in 2023, including the RESTRICT Act, DATA Act, and ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act, that aim to empower the executive branch to ban TikTok. In this manner, tensions with China have risen to a \u201ckitchen table issue\u201d: up to 150 million Americans use TikTok and could be directly impacted by a ban, unlike prior restrictions on telecommunications equipment manufacturers, such as Huawei and ZTE.\n\n \n\nThe Goals and Challenges of a TikTok Ban or Divestiture\n\nAny policy towards TikTok warrants a careful cost-benefit analysis, especially since a ban or divestiture of a consumer-facing app of this size is virtually unprecedented in the United States. Because divestiture would likely face significant regulatory and financial hurdles, including Chinese export control laws, US antitrust scrutiny, and broader economic volatility, the reported CFIUS decision could result in a de facto ban. Proponents of an outright ban have expressed concerns that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) might access TikTok\u2019s user data or even control its content recommendation algorithm to target disinformation. While the Biden administration and Congress have not presented any public evidence of such misuse in the past, their position is that the CCP might do so in the future under statutes such as the 2017 National Intelligence Law. TikTok has attempted to reduce these risks through Project Texas: a plan to store Americans\u2019 personal information in the United States, outside the CCP\u2019s jurisdiction, among other safeguards. The Biden administration has not publicly explained why CFIUS abandoned Project Texas negotiations in favor of a ban or divestiture, but a widespread lack of trust amongst Americans regarding independent Chinese-based companies in the United States complicates any middle-ground agreement.\n\nIndiscriminate data collection poses legitimate privacy and national security risks, but banning or divesting TikTok is not an effective solution to address them. US digital platforms face little to no legal requirements to protect personal information or prevent the proliferation of harmful content. As such, from a practical standpoint, these stated risks would persist even if ByteDance sold TikTok to a US company. In fact, numerous US-based mobile apps and data brokers collect enormous amounts of sensitive personal information and transfer it abroad\u2014including to entities within China. Moreover, disinformation is a decentralized problem that stems from many actors on both US and non-US platforms. Some of the most harmful examples actually originated domestically, such as the \u201cBig Lie\u201d that primarily spread on platforms like Parler, Gab, and Fox News leading up to the US Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. In other words, CFIUS and lawmakers are pushing a TikTok-specific solution to address risks that are scattered across the broader technology ecosystem.\n\nAny cost-benefit analysis must also consider the risks of banning TikTok\u2014not just the risks of it continuing to operate in the United States. In the short-term, a ban would primarily impact US TikTok users, not the CCP: it would block a form of speech and creative expression for approximately one-third of Americans and directly harm brand influencers, musicians, and political organizers. In the long-term, precedent with TikTok could encourage other countries to impose similar restrictions on US companies, especially given widespread global distrust of an underregulated US data ecosystem with frequent privacy scandals in both the public and private sectors. When France followed the United States in prohibiting TikTok on government-issued devices in March 2023, it also included US mobile apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Netflix on that list. The Court of Justice of the European Union previously invalidated two EU-US data transfer agreements in its Schrems I (2015) and Schrems II (2020) decisions, demonstrating how ongoing concerns with US government surveillance, too, could threaten to normalize barriers to international data flows.\n\n \n\nMore Holistic Approaches to Digital Privacy and Safety\n\nThese trends are not sustainable. An increasingly walled-off internet would disrupt global commerce, access to information, and communications flows. Legislation like the RESTRICT Act could signal a long-term policy shift towards banning or selling off additional non-US platforms that transfer personal data\u2014which, in a digital age, could broadly encompass numerous commercial and non-profit entities. Rather than engaging in a potentially perilous action of that scope, Congress should instead create legal limitations on how all US companies process and transfer personal information, including to inform automated profiling and content recommendation algorithms. In turn, the Biden administration must improve public transparency on its decision to divest or ban TikTok and allow opportunities for civil society input\u2014especially for an action that could affect millions of Americans. So far, Congress has placed the entire burden on TikTok to prove that it does not pose security risks, but the administration has not provided a classified congressional briefing or public evidence that: (1) TikTok\u2019s data practices are substantially different from its US-based competitors, (2) it poses a tangible enough threat to warrant a drastic measure like a ban, and (3) more targeted solutions such as updated privacy regulations or Project Texas would not sufficiently address the stated issue.\n\nIn recent weeks, several lawmakers have acknowledged that concerns over TikTok\u2019s data collection and algorithmic targeting reflect systemic under regulation across the US digital sector, and have called for comprehensive legislation like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act to set boundaries on how all businesses process, transfer, and store personal information. Despite this recognition, there are a few possible strategic calculations behind the recent momentum to ban just TikTok. First, there is the idea of reciprocity: since China has blocked US companies like Google and Facebook, some might argue that the United States is justified in banning TikTok. After all, the biggest beneficiaries of a TikTok ban would be its US competitors\u2014Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, all of whom engage in comparable data collection and content recommendation tactics. In addition, some contend that banning TikTok could prevent the CCP from accessing social media data to train facial recognition algorithms, thus strengthening the US technological advantage in artificial intelligence development, even though most user-uploaded videos and images are public anyways. In this manner, some lawmakers might see a TikTok ban as an offensive approach\u2014not just a defensive one.\n\nHowever, this form of economic protectionism is short sighted. It is a product of increasingly hawkish attitudes among US lawmakers, based on a notion of fundamental differences in democratic and authoritarian principles. If the United States takes similar steps to China, it risks undermining its own message. China has already been criticized by much of the world for its \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d and the United States\u2019 global image could similarly suffer if it also resorts to banning large chunks of the internet primarily based on country of origin. Nor should the United States, with a long tradition of free speech, head down the CCP\u2019s path of censoring communications from up to 150 million Americans to address unproven fears that a small fraction of those accounts may express ideas associated with a government it does not like.\n\nDuring a hearing on March 23, House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) told TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew: \u201cWe do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values.\u201d But what exactly do American values consist of in a widely polarized nation? During the hearing, legislators blamed TikTok for a range of issues from harming mental health to allowing drug-related content\u2014thereby conflating problems that are specific to TikTok and those that are broader societal issues. In one ironic example, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL), who is a board member of the Alachua County Friends of the National Rifle Association, lambasted Chew during the hearing over a user-uploaded video that contained a cartoon gun.

{"text":"In a major step forward for the reorganization of Celsius Network LLC and its affiliated debtors (the \"Debtors\"), the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved the adequacy of the Debtors\u2019 fourth amended disclosure statement and the solicitation and voting procedures for their joint plan of reorganization (the \"Plan\") on August 17, 2023. The court order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) sets forth the key dates and deadlines relating to the confirmation process, such as filing objections, voting on the Plan, and attending the confirmation hearing. The Order approving the disclosure statement can be found here.\n\nA hearing on confirmation of the plan is tentatively scheduled for October 2, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET. Prior to the confirmation hearing, creditors will have a chance to vote on the Plan and those Creditors eligible to vote will be receiving solicitation materials, likely in the next few days. The Plan that creditors are going to be voting on is substantially the same as the one that we analyzed in our prior post.\n\nThe following is a summary of some of the key terms contained in the Order and the Solicitation Procedures related to voting and confirmation of the Plan.\n\nThe Order establishes the following key dates and deadlines for the Plan confirmation process:\n \nThe Order also approved the Debtors\u2019 Solicitation Procedures, which govern the distribution of solicitation packages and the Plan voting process. The Solicitation Procedures provide for the following:\n\nSolicitation packages will include a cover letter, a letter from the official committee of unsecured creditors, the Solicitation Procedures, the applicable ballot form, a notice of claims settlement, the Disclosure Statement and its exhibits (including the Plan), the Order, the notice of the Confirmation Hearing, and any additional court-ordered documents.\n\nSolicitation packages will be distributed primarily via email (e.g., for account holders and other holders with email addresses on file). The Debtors will also cause a \u201cpush\u201d notification to be delivered via their mobile application to holders of certain claims. Physical packages will be provided upon request.\n\nHolders of claims entitled to vote on the Plan may submit their Ballots via (a) the Claims, Noticing, and Solicitation Agent's online voting platform at https:\/\/case.stretto.com\/Celsius\/balloting, or (b) mail or hand-delivery to the Claims, Noticing, and Solicitation Agent at Celsius Ballot Processing c\/o Stretto, 410 Exchange, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92602.\n\nNon-voting notices will be provided in lieu of Solicitation Packages for unimpaired claims, claims deemed to reject the Plan, disputed claims, and unclassified claims.\n\nOn the voting ballot, applicable creditors will have the option to opt out of the settlement, whereby claims are increased by 5% in exchange for waiving fraud claims.\n\nAssumption and rejection notices will be provided to contract counterparties.\n\nIrregular ballots will be subject to the Debtors' discretion (in consultation with the Committee).\n\nAmendments to plan documents will be allowed, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval and notice requirements.\n\nOne potentially noteworthy revision to the amended disclosure statement is pointing out that the Debtors have yet to settle with the CEL Token Holders and, to the extent that they have not done so by the time of the Confirmation Hearing and the CEL Token Holders vote to reject the Plan, they will look to the Court for guidance.\n\nRepayment to Earn and most other creditors will not take place until after the Plan is confirmed.\n\nThe Plan provides better treatment for those Creditors who actively vote for the plan, as such creditors should carefully review the Solicitation Procedures and the instructions on the ballot forms before voting on the Plan and consult with their legal advisors regarding their rights and obligations under the Plan. Creditors should also monitor the Debtors' case website at https:\/\/cases.stretto.com\/celsius\/ for any updates or amendments to the Plan, the Order, or the Solicitation Procedures. In particular, if there is any discrepancy in your claim type or amount you should reach out to Stretto, the company, or your legal counsel.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russia kept one of its main gas supply routes to Europe shut on Saturday, stoking fears of winter fuel shortages and spotlighting differences between Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Germany's Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) over repair work on the pipeline.\n\nAlready struggling to tame soaring gas prices, European governments had expected the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to resume flows after a short maintenance this week but Russia abruptly cancelled the restart, citing an oil leak in a turbine.\n\nEurope has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in what Moscow has called an \"economic war\" with the West over the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions.\n\nThe latest Nord Stream shutdown, which Russia says will last for as long as it takes to carry out repairs, added to fears of winter gas shortages that could help tip major economies into recession and energy rationing.\n\nThe discovery of the oil leak on Friday coincided with the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies proceeding with plans to impose a price gap on Russian oil, intending to shrink President Vladimir Putin's resources to fight the war in Ukraine.\n\nGas shortages also prompted European Union member Sweden on Saturday to unveil a financial support package for energy firms.\n\n\"If we do not act, there is a serious risk of disruptions in the financial system, which in the worst case could lead to a financial crisis,\" said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.\n\n\"Putin wants to create division, but our message is clear: you will not succeed,\" she said.\n\nGAS PRICE RALLY EXPECTED\nGazprom said Siemens Energy was ready to carry out repairs on the pipeline but that there was nowhere available to carry out the work, a suggestion Siemens Energy denied, saying it had not been asked to do the job.\n\nSiemens Energy has also said that sanctions do not prohibit maintenance.\n\nBefore the latest round of maintenance, Gazprom had already cut flows to just 20% of the pipeline's capacity.\n\n\"Siemens is taking part in repair work in accordance with the current contract, is detecting malfunctions ... and is ready to fix the oil leaks. Only there is nowhere to do the repair,\" Gazprom said in a statement on its Telegram channel on Saturday.\n\nSiemens Energy said it had not been commissioned to carry out the work but was available, adding that the Gazprom-reported leak would not usually affect the operation of a turbine and could be sealed on site.\n\n\"Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several times that there are enough additional turbines available in the Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nFlows through Nord Stream 1 were due to resume early on Saturday morning. But hours before it was set to start pumping gas, Gazprom published a photo on Friday of what it said was an oil leak on a piece of equipment.\n\nSiemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment at Nord Stream 1's Portovaya compressor station said on Friday the leak did not constitute a technical reason to stop gas flows.\n\n\n\"Global natural gas prices will likely rally hard on Monday as markets readjust to this latest #Gazprom development,\" Tom Marzec-Manser, Head of Gas Analytics at ICIS, said on twitter.\n\n\"The closure of #NordStream1 reduces overall Russian pipeline flows yet further and will make balancing supply & demand this winter all the more difficult.\"\n\nAsked about the halt on Saturday, Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said that the European Union expects Russia to respect its agreed energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if Moscow fails to do so. read more\n\nThe German network regulator said that the country's gas supply was currently guaranteed but the situation was fragile and further deterioration could not be ruled out.\n\n\"The defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the halt of operations,\" it said.\n\nWholesale gas prices have rocketed more than 400% since August 2021, squeezing households already gripped by a cost-of-living crisis and forcing some energy hungry industries, such as fertiliser and aluminium makers, to scale back production.\n\nThe European Commission has said a full cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Europe, if combined with a cold winter, could reduce average EU gross domestic product by up to 1.5% if countries did not prepare in advance.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"For decades, the association of shipping companies that use the port has hired longshore workers from a list supplied by the union \u2014 a list created by asking each union member to provide a single name. But certain candidates appearing on the list are currently children under three years of age\nStriking dockworkers from the Port of Montreal walk the picket line during the first day of a strike in Montreal on Monday, April 26, 2021. A labour arbitrator has accused the dockworkers of giving the names of their family members as future hires at the port. (Paul Chiasson\/The Canadian Press)\n\nSocial Sharing\n\nLabour arbitrator says list amounts to employment discrimination based on family situation\n\nThe union representing dockworkers at the Port of Montreal says it has ended a long-standing hiring practice that has been criticized for fostering nepotism \u2014 to the point where workers' preschool offspring were placed on a list of potential employees.\n\nFor decades, the association of shipping companies that use the port has hired longshore workers from a list supplied by the union \u2014 a list created by asking each union member to provide a single name.\n\nBut the Maritime Employers Association has argued the list is a recipe for nepotism, resulting in few women candidates or members of ethnic minorities, but in some instances children who were barely out of diapers.\n\nIn April, a labour arbitrator ordered a series of changes after finding it was impossible for people to get their names on the list unless they were related to current dockworkers.\n\n\"It appeared that this list contained, almost exclusively, the names of family members of each of the longshore workers, without any verification of merit or the ability of these people to do the job of a longshore worker,'' Nathalie Faucher wrote in her decision, which was first reported by La Presse.\n\nShe found that the list amounted to employment discrimination based on family situation, which is banned under federal human rights law.\n\nIn another decision on the matter last year, Faucher had noted the employer's contention that \"certain candidates appearing on the union's master list are currently children under three years of age.''\n\nSince 2015, 50 per cent of longshore workers have been hired from the union's list \u2014 previously all hires were drawn from the list.\n\nFaucher found that while the process has faced criticism since the early 1980s, previous attempts to change the system resulted in long conflicts. \"Strong measures will have to be taken to break this cycle of systemic discrimination,'' she wrote.\n\nThe Canadian Union of Public Employees-affiliated union had argued no questions were asked about the relationship between the person being added to the list and the member proposing them, so it was unaware of any family links. However, Faucher found those links were often self-evident.\n\nThe union also claimed the association's challenge to the list was an attempt to short-circuit upcoming contract negotiations.\n\nUnion respecting decision\n\nSpokesman Michel Murray said the union is fully respecting the arbitrator's April decision, which ordered it to take more than a dozen steps to make it possible for anyone qualified to get their name on the list. The arbitrator also appointed an independent monitor to ensure her orders were being respected.\n\nMurray said the list goes back decades \"to when active longshore workers were asked by shipping companies to have their family members join the workforce when the Port of Montreal was busy.''\n\nBecause each worker could put only a single name on the list, \"it was not uncommon for minors to be listed, given that it could take several years before the employer issued a call for applications,'' he wrote in an email Tuesday.\n\nThe Maritime Employers Association said it's not questioning the union's prerogative to choose workers \u2014 but the process must comply with human rights law and the collective agreement.\n\n\"We are obviously pleased with the arbitration decision in the nepotism case. Inclusion, equality and accessibility for all are important values for the MEA,'' said Isabelle Pelletier, the association's vice-president of communications and public affairs.\n\n'Times have changed'\n\nJohn Corey, the president of the Freight Management Association of Canada, said that like other publicly traded companies, large shipping companies have to report on diversity and governance in their financial statements.\n\n\"They have an obligation to report on those issues to their shareholders, so it makes it much more difficult for a company to say, we're just going to hire friends and relatives. Times have changed,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nPier-Luc Bilodeau, an industrial relations professor at Universit\u00e9 Laval, said systems in which employers hire candidates selected by unions have existed at other North American ports, as well as for stagehands and in the construction industry, though the practice has been banned in Quebec's construction sector.\n\n\"As a group we want to make sure that the generation after us, our children, can have this opportunity to have good jobs \u2014 that's the logic behind the union's approach,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nWhile the presence of young children on the list may seem shocking, it follows that same logic \u2014 union members don't know when more workers will be needed and want to ensure their children are near the top of the list when they are able to fill jobs at the port.\n\nJean-Claude Bernatchez, a professor of labour relations at the Universit\u00e9 du Quebec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, said the organization of work at the Port of Montreal will likely be one of the central issues as the union begins negotiations with the MEA on Thursday.\n\n\"The unions want to keep the number of jobs they have in Montreal. There's something like 1,400 longshore workers and they want to keep their wages, they want to keep their methods, so they're resistant to change,'' he said.\n\n\"As for the employer, they want to reduce their costs, they want to introduce technology as much as possible to make things more efficient.''","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Amazon and companies it contracts to deliver packages across the country are facing a rash of lawsuits alleging they failed to pay drivers the minimum wage and overtime and provide mandated rest and meal breaks under pressure to complete Amazon deliveries on time.\n\nIn late February, Amazon delivery drivers working for eight contractors in the Seattle area in Washington State received notices that they'd won $8.2 million in a class action settlement for wage violations, according to a court settlement notice that will go before a judge in May 2021 for final approval.\n\n\nThe class action lawsuit was filed in Washington state in 2017 by two Amazon delivery drivers, Gus Ortiz and Mark Fredley, who alleged that an Amazon delivery company called Jungle Trux required them to deliver between 150 and 200 packages a day and failed to provide legally mandated rest and lunch breaks, and refused to pay drivers for those missed breaks. \n\nCourt and government documents show that these wage theft violations impacting Amazon's delivery drivers were rampant across the United States between 2017 and 2020. Last week, the state of California fined Amazon $6.4 million for failing to pay overtime and offer rest breaks to 700 contracted delivery drivers in Southern California between 2018 and 2020. In 2019, Amazon delivery drivers in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey won $1.8 million in unpaid wages. \n\n\u201cAmazon does not tolerate violations of labor laws,\" Leah Seay, an Amazon spokesperson told Motherboard. \"Where we find repeated violations, or an inability to correct labor violations, we terminate contracts with DSP program participants.\u201d\n\nThough Amazon's delivery drivers operate Amazon-emblazoned vans, wear Amazon uniforms, and are trained by Amazon employees, they are technically not employed directly by Amazon but by small contractors, known as \"delivery service partners,\" that operate out of Amazon warehouses around the country. \n\nAmazon has been sued in many of these wage theft cases, as lawsuits claim that Amazon serves as a joint employer of its delivery drivers because of the extensive control it exerts over them. \"Amazon [is responsible for] virtually every aspect of [drivers'] jobs, including the existence of the job itself,\" the Washington State lawsuit against Amazon and eight of its contractors reads. \n\nCollectively, the lawsuits repeat similar stories of how Amazon lacked a streamlined process for paying drivers and under financial pressure from Amazon, delivery companies frequently broke the law in order to squeeze productivity out of their drivers. Many Amazon delivery companies earn revenue based on whether packages get delivered successfully on time (undelivered packages are known as \"concessions.\")\n\nThe lawsuits allege that between 2018 and mid-2020, Amazon's delivery drivers were frequently paid daily rates, such as $135 a day, to deliver packages for 10 hours. But because of high delivery quotas, drivers often worked more than 11 continuous hours, not pausing for legally-mandated lunch and rest breaks. \n\nEven after drivers had finished delivering the packages in their vans, drivers are frequently asked by dispatchers to \"rescue\" other drivers, according to the lawsuits. Though they qualified for overtime, Amazon's delivery companies did not pay drivers for extra hours spent on the road. Often this meant drivers earned less than the minimum wage. To make matters worse, delivery companies often did not track how many hours their drivers had worked. \n\nAmazon is currently battling at least four class action lawsuits in Texas, Ohio, Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Florida, Illinois, and Maryland, according to legal documents reviewed by Motherboard on Pacer, the federal database of court cases. \n\nFlorida driver Andrea Thomas \"was paid $130 per scheduled ten-hour shift and she was not paid an overtime premium, despite regularly working 50-60 hours or more per week,\" the complaint for an ongoing lawsuit against Amazon and a delivery company called JSTC in Melbourne, Florida, reads.   \n\nAnother ongoing lawsuit alleges an Amazon delivery company called Sheard Loman Transport, operating out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, terminated Heather Gongaware, a dispatcher in 2018 who threatened legal action for not receiving overtime pay and organized with her colleagues on the app GroupMe. At the time, the owner of the company fired her and told her \"she was being terminated for discussing legal options for recovering unpaid overtime with other drivers,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"I never filled out a timesheet. The manager did it for us,\" a former Amazon delivery driver who worked for Jungle Trux in 2018 in the Seattle area, and received a legal notice in February that he was eligible for part of the Washington state settlement, told Motherboard. The amount each driver receives from the settlement will depend on how long they worked. The former delivery driver said he received a notice that he will receive $1,000 for work between October 2018 and November 2019. Motherboard granted him anonymity because he feared retaliation from Amazon. \n\nJungle Trux's attorneys did not respond to Motherboard's request for comment.  \n\nUnder the Federal Labor Standards Act of 1938, companies must guarantee their employees overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week, even when workers are paid daily rates. In many states, workers also must receive unpaid meal breaks and paid rest breaks on their shifts, and must be paid at least the minimum hourly wage, including if it falls below the day rate. \n\nIn 2018, Amazon launched its delivery service partner program, which was designed to allow small businesses, capped at 40 vans, to operate out of Amazon warehouses and employ their own delivery drivers. This program allowed Amazon to rapidly scale up its last mile delivery network to offer free one-day shipping for Amazon Prime members, while shirking financial and legal responsibility for maintaining vehicles and paying and providing benefits and protections to drivers who deliver its packages under exhausting conditions. \"[In the early days], it was like the Wild West,\" the former Amazon delivery driver from Washington said. \n\nIn California, the recent state investigation that resulted in $6.4 million in penalties found that between April 2017 and January 2020, drivers at a Amazon delivery service partner Green Messengers who were scheduled to work 10-hour days often worked 11 or more hours to complete their routes\u2014resulting in minimum wage violations, unpaid overtime, and missed rest and meal break violations. Amazon and its affiliated delivery company's fine amounts to $7,388 per worker, though some of these penalties will be paid to the state. \n\nThe California Labor Commissioner is investigating an independent business we previously partnered with,\" Leah Seay, the Amazon spokesperson told Motherboard. \"We were not aware of the investigation and are appealing the citation.\u201d\n\nAmazon did not respond to a question from Motherboard about whether all its delivery companies have switched from daily to hourly rates paid but told Motherboard that its contracts with all of their delivery companies now require that they track and pay for hours worked.\n\nAn Amazon delivery driver organizer and delivery company owner told Motherboard that in 2020 many delivery companies transitioned away from paying daily rates to a streamlined process that requires hourly rates and an electronic timekeeping systems, such as ADP and Paycom. An organizer in Southern California, told Motherboard that they hadn't seen local Amazon delivery companies pay workers day rates for a year. Motherboard agreed to keep these sources anonymous because they feared retaliation. The company owner in Washington state said electronic time-keeping is now required of delivery companies in his region and paying drivers daily rates has been banned. These new policies, they say, have helped resolve wage theft problems by requiring workers to clock in and out every time they work.\n\nDo you have a tip to share with us about working for an Amazon DSP? We\u2019d love to hear from you. Please get in touch with the author Lauren via email lauren.gurley@vice.com or on Signal 201-897-2109.\n\nThe Philadelphia class action law firm, Berger Montague, which has at least three open wage theft cases against Amazon around the country, has an open nationwide call for Amazon delivery drivers who believe they are owed back wages from Amazon and delivery service partners. Lawyers at this firm declined Motherboard's request for comment. ","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"When we think of tech in Indonesia, the first thing that usually comes to mind are homegrown unicorns like GoTo and Traveloka, big consumer-facing start-ups that are integral to the country\u2019s rapidly growing digital economy. And for a while, it seemed like this would become a new frontier of global competition, as companies like Uber tried to enter the market and waves of foreign investment underwrote explosive growth. But Uber pulled out, and investors have turned cautious on tech darlings like GoTo. Consumer-facing tech remains important to Indonesia\u2019s economic growth story, but it is not an area of high-stakes geopolitics.\n\nMastery of cutting-edge industrial technologies, on the other hand, still comes with significant geostrategic and economic advantages, and the acquisition and development of such technologies are both highly competitive and intensely political. In Indonesia, there are signs of sharpening geopolitical competition in technology-intensive sectors such as battery manufacturing, clean energy, and data centers.\n\nIndonesia is set to be a major player in the global clean energy transition, as it holds the world\u2019s largest supply of nickel ore, an important input in the manufacture of batteries. Batteries will be key in a low-carbon future, so Indonesia has leverage here. It has used a series of export bans on unrefined ore to force investment into higher value-added downstream activities like nickel smelting with an eye toward battery and eventually electric vehicle production.\n\nChinese companies like Tsingshan were some of the first to plow billions into the nickel-rich island of Sulawesi and have built large industrial parks there to process the ore domestically. Chinese battery makers like CATL followed by investing billions in domestic battery production facilities. Indonesian nickel has major strategic value to China, as it does to any country battling for supremacy in global electric vehicle and battery supply chains, and it shows.\n\nDIPLOMAT BRIEF\nWEEKLY NEWSLETTER\nGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nGET THE NEWSLETTER\nAlthough China may have had the first-mover advantage, a wave of foreign investment has followed as South Korean and Japanese auto and battery companies have rushed to catch up with their Chinese competitors by establishing or expanding industrial production in Indonesia. Ford even recently announced it would be part of a $4.5 billion nickel investment project (with a Chinese partner). There is a burgeoning techno-industrial ecosystem anchored by nickel mines and ending in the production of batteries and electric vehicles taking shape in Indonesia, and global powers are jockeying for position.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nGeopolitical competition coupled with Indonesia\u2019s bebas-aktif strategy with its \u201cmiddle way\u201d orientation benefits Indonesia\u2019s techno-industrial ambitions here more so than in consumer-facing tech, as global rivals race to secure access to scarce supplies of nickel. In the process, Indonesia stands to benefit from big FDI inflows and potentially the transfer and mastery of new skills and industrial technologies.\n\nWhile it appears that China gained a first-mover advantage in nickel, the United States has recently emerged as an important player in clean energy. At the G-20 last November, President Joko Widodo announced the Just Energy Transition Partnership, a $20 billion commitment from development banks, the U.S., Japan, and European allies to invest in clean energy. China was not part of this deal and has not been a major player in Indonesia\u2019s renewable energy sector. Given that Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s largest consumers and producers of fossil fuels like coal, and that electricity consumption in the country is expected to grow strongly in the coming decades, investing in renewable energy now has long-term strategic and economic implications.\n\nAnother area of the burgeoning competition is Indonesia\u2019s data infrastructure. China\u2019s Huawei dominates the supply of telecommunications equipment, but the field is more open for data centers and cloud computing. Next generation technologies like artificial intelligence need a lot of computing power and require big investments in back-end infrastructure, and Indonesia has been positioning itself as a regional hub for this physical hardware. Amazon already said it would invest $5 billion over 15 years in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, while Huawei pledged $300 million over five years. It is likely that competitive investment in this sector will intensify in coming years.\n\nThose who know Indonesia\u2019s economic history know that technology, economic development, and power are deeply intertwined. One reason the Dutch were able to exploit the land, labor, and resources of Indonesia during the colonial period was by monopolizing and restricting access to advanced technologies and know-how. In most cases, Indonesia still lacks the ability to indigenously push the boundaries of the technological frontier. It remains dependent on foreign partners for capital and technology-intensive development.\n\nNevertheless, there has been a push to capture more of the value added through advanced technology and keep it in Indonesia. This is enabled, in part, by the emergence of a multipolar world and increasing geopolitical competition. Great Power rivals like the U.S. and China looking to expand their spheres of influence must compete to secure market access, investment opportunities and strategic supply chains in countries like Indonesia. And the way to do that is to offer Indonesia the things it really wants like investment in technology-intensive sectors, and transfer of skills and advanced production capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell if or how this will translate into long-term mastery of advanced skills and technologies. And there may come a time when Indonesia and other middle powers in the region are forced to pick a side. But that time has not yet come, and for now geopolitical rivalry benefits Indonesia by allowing them to more forcefully ask the question: what\u2019s in it for us?","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

Agricultural commodity prices may be tumbling, but on-the-shelf prices will keep going up.\n\nUnilever, the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, will continue raising prices because it has only passed off three-quarters of its higher costs onto consumers, CEO Alan Jope said this week. While the company hinted the pain may ease this year, it may sell fewer of its products as shoppers balk at paying more. In the face of higher input costs, food giants like Unilever and Nestle are also narrowing their product ranges as they try to simplify operations to save money.\n\n\nInflation on raw materials such as oils, corn, wheat, rice and potatoes should persist, Kellogg said, adding that it sees European consumers facing more pressure than others.

Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45% share of Climate Technologies' post-close results. The Company will exclude the interest income from the note receivable from Climate Technologies and its share of Climate Technologies' operations in its calculation of 2023 adjusted earnings per share. Also excluded from adjusted earnings per share is the interest income on any undeployed net proceeds.

Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the probable significance or impact on our earnings per share results from the 45% share of Climate Technologies' post-close results.

{"text":"The transaction, which completed on 10 October 2016 in line with an ambitious timetable, was the biggest ever takeover of a London-listed company and one of the most complex acquisitions in history.\n\nThe deal achieved significant market recognition too, helping the firm win:\n\nGlobal M&A Deal of the Year: Grand Prize at the American Lawyer Awards 2016;\nBenelux M&A Legal Adviser of the Year at the Mergermarket European M&A Awards 2016;\nGlobal M&A Deal of the Year: Central and Eastern Europe at the American Lawyer Global Legal Awards 2017 (for our work advising on the sale of SABMiller's central and eastern European assets to Asahi); and \nMatter of the Year at the Global Competition Review Awards 2017.\nThe Financial Times Innovative Lawyers Europe survey 2016 ranked our work on the deal as 'Standout' in the 'Mergers and Acquisitions' category.\n\nThe antitrust challenge \nExecuting the takeover of the world\u2019s no. 2 brewer by the no. 1 was extremely challenging from an antitrust perspective.\n\nMerger filings were needed in more than 30 jurisdictions and remedies were required in more than half to deal with regulators\u2019 concerns over antitrust and public interest implications. And this was a high pressure process \u2013 AB InBev wanted to close as quickly as possible and the deal carried a $3bn break fee, the largest ever negotiated.\n\nAlongside this we had to devise a unique transaction structure to take into account numerous considerations including AB InBev and SABMiller\u2019s corporate objectives, shareholder priorities (including obtaining tax-free treatment for SABMiller shareholders who wanted to receive equity as part of the transaction) and transactional taxes (such as stamp duties), together with UK and Belgian law and applicable regulatory rules.\n\nCreating a narrative\nExecuting a deal of this size required a clear strategy and meticulous preparation.\n\nTo make the regulatory approvals process as smooth as possible, we worked with AB InBev\u2019s PR and financial advisers to craft a narrative that explained the deal\u2019s benefits for investors, regulators, consumers and the market.\n\nWe also oversaw AB InBev\u2019s web, video and social media strategies to ensure all communications were consistent with regulatory filings and UK and Belgian rules.\n\nPrint\n Share\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n US\nEnglish\nUS English\n\n\nView the infographic: the deal in numbers\n\nPDF, 133.24KB\n\n\nAB InBev: the deal explained\n\nAnnounce carousel\n\nAnticipating the remedies\nOur antitrust strategy documented the precise order in which the filings needed to be made around the world.\n\nWe then established a centrally co-ordinated global team (comprising our lawyers and leading practitioners from more than 80 national firms) to implement the plan. \n\nWe assessed what remedies would be needed to avoid prolonged investigations in key jurisdictions and pre-negotiated the sales of assets in multiple countries. The most significant remedy packages were devised with AB InBev before it had even approached SABMiller, to ensure the smoothest possible path for the transaction.\n\nWe also proactively dealt with public interest concerns, for example in South Africa where AB InBev agreed a set of public interest commitments with the Minister of Economic Development. These included a secondary listing for the combined group on the Johannesburg stock exchange, development initiatives, local investment and a continued commitment to SABMiller's broad-based black economic empowerment scheme.\n\nManaging shareholders, planning strategy\nThe novel structure combined an offer and merger process in Belgium with a UK scheme of arrangement. We also created a new holding company, listed in Belgium, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.\n\nTo manage the competing demands of SABMiller's shareholders, we designed a bespoke, unlisted security in the combined company that is convertible to ordinary shares after five years. The amount of securities offered was capped to limit dilution of the AB InBev shareholders and help all parties achieve their ambitions.\n\nThroughout the deal we acted as strategic advisers to the AB InBev board, leading them through the legal challenges across the world and helping plan the strategy for negotiations with SABMiller.\n\nThese became particularly tense when, as completion drew near, the UK's Brexit vote led to a sharp decline in sterling that ultimately required AB InBev to increase its offer.\n\nOpening up opportunities\nThe deal enabled AB InBev to establish itself as a genuinely global brewer and one of the world's biggest consumer products companies.\n\nWhile it was already the no. 1 brewer by sales, AB InBev has now acquired valuable assets in key emerging regions with strong growth prospects such as Africa, Asia and Central and South America. It will be able to provide more choices for beer drinkers in new and existing markets.\n\nThis transformative transaction was executed in just 13 months. In the words of AB InBev itself, it was 'a world-class team and a world-class result'.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"The rise of gold mining in Sudan, which has become Africa\u2019s third largest producer of the precious mineral over the last decade, has gone hand in hand with the growth of poverty in a country that ranks 172nd in the United Nations Human Development Index (out of a total of 191 nations). While Sudanese authorities announced in January that a record production had been achieved in 2022, the World Bank\u2019s economic indicators pointed to a very different mark for this country located in the Horn of Africa: the percentage of the population below the poverty threshold had risen steadily from 15.3% in 2014 to 32.9% in 2022. That is to say, right now around 15 million people are living on less than $2.15 (\u20ac1.96) a day.\n\nAlthough the gold industry does not explain by itself the impoverishment of Sudan, the battle over its control is fueling the current conflict between the Sudanese army and the main paramilitary organization, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), for whom gold has become one of its main sources of funding. At least 604 people have died and another 5,127 have been injured since a fresh confrontation broke out on April 15, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\nNo one knows exactly how much gold is being extracted in Sudan. The industry began to gain traction following the secession of South Sudan in 2011, as a way to compensate for the two-thirds of oil wells that Khartoum lost with the independence of the south of the territory. Although available figures are confusing, they do offer a dimension of the mineral\u2019s economic potential. In January, the director of the General Administration for the Supervision and Control of Production Companies, Alaeldin Ali, stated at a media conference that the country had achieved a new extraction record, having exceeded its best production by one ton and 611 kilograms. The previous record was set in 2017 with 107 tons. In other words, last year\u2019s extraction would have been around 109 tons, according to these official calculations. The Sudanese Resources Company announced in April that the export of gold, to the tune of around 41.8 tons, had brought in revenue of about $2 billion (\u20ac1.8 billion) in 2022.\n\nNone of these figures include the gold that gets smuggled out of the country. \u201cThe Central Bank of Sudan has recognized that [mineral] smuggling is a major problem in the country,\u201d says Denise Sprimont-Vasquez, an analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS). This expert points to the gold extraction companies controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, Hemedti, as one of the actors responsible for this looting. The other faction, the national army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, exploits other economic sectors of the country. And then there is the Wagner Group, a shady organization of Russian mercenaries with ties to the Kremlin, whom the United States and the European Union accuse of exploiting Sudanese gold through shell companies. In January of this year, it was revealed that three Russian citizens had been arrested for smuggling gold out of Sudan, recalls Sprimont-Vasquez.\n\nNor does the Sudanese state have the capacity to account for the gold extracted through artisanal mining methods, which according to the C4ADS analyst represents 85% of the country\u2019s total. \u201cAs this activity is mainly informal, it is unlikely that it will be covered by official statistics,\u201d she adds.\n\nSudan\nTwo men pan for gold in Sudan, near Khartoum.\nERIC LAFFORGUE\nThe 2021 coup, which ended the transitional government and gave way to the military executive of Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, increased opacity in the gold sector, says Joseph Siegle, research director at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. During the brief period that Sudan\u2019s transitional government lasted (from the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 to October 2021), an audit by the civilian-led Ministry of Finance revealed that most revenues from gold were not declared. \u201cIn 2021 alone, at least 32 tons of gold went unaccounted for, according to state inspections, which is a minimum of $1.9 billion,\u201d Siegle explains. The figure was advanced by CNN in a 2022 investigation. \u201cThe estimate that was made is that in 2021 the real production of gold might have reached 233 tons, a figure much higher than what is reflected in the official data,\u201d adds Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Luengo, an expert in sub-Saharan African resources and a member of the African Studies Group at Madrid\u2019s Autonomous University.\n\nGold as a weapon of war\nGold is financing part of the conflict. \u201cIt provides Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo with a deep, government-independent war chest to finance his conflict, even though the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by al-Burhan, also control many companies and economic sectors in the country,\u201d Siegle stresses. Dagalo, according to this analyst, has become one of the richest men in the country, among other things due to his control of the gold sector, in addition to livestock and infrastructure, in the western region of Darfur.\n\nThis control of resources by military actors is, says Siegle, an important factor in the current conflict and one of the reasons that keep the country in a critical economic situation. \u201cIf the armed forces had to submit to a civilian government, as required by the framework agreement that governed the transition to democracy, then these resources would enter the government treasury, contributing significantly to the economic recovery and stabilization of the country.\u201d\n\nGold extracted from Sudan is believed to have helped stabilize the Russian economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent international sanctions\nResearch director at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies\nBut Moscow also benefits from this state of affairs. \u201cWagner, under Yevgeny Prigozhin [known as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s chef] has become very active in the Sudanese gold sector, including in close collaboration with Hemedti,\u201d Siegle explains. According to this expert, it was precisely the arrival of the Wagner Group, whose presence in Sudan Prigozhin has denied, that has raised part of Sudan\u2019s artisanal mining to a commercial scale. \u201cThis would explain the record levels of extraction; gold extracted from Sudan is believed to have helped stabilize the Russian economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent international sanctions [against Moscow],\u201d he stresses. According to a CNN investigation published last July and based on information from official Sudanese sources, between February and July of last year at least 16 flights left Sudan for Russia loaded with smuggled gold.\n\nWhile paramilitary and foreign actors share the exploitation of gold, those 233 tons that are estimated to have been extracted in 2021 would have meant revenues of more than $13 billion [\u20ac11.7 billion], notes Garc\u00eda Luengo. \u201cThis income would be fundamental in a country where the population suffers from severe deprivations, with low Human Development Index indicators and an immense need for basic social services.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the scant control over gold mining not only perpetuates poverty, but also represents a major environmental and public health problem. Artisanal miners often use mercury, which is cheaper than other substances, to separate gold from other minerals. During the process, the extracted amalgam is heated, as mercury evaporates before the gold melts. However, it is odorless and highly toxic, so it is easily inhaled by workers, in addition to contaminating land and water.\n\nTo measure the impact of this pollution, Garc\u00eda Luengo recalls that some two million people work in Sudan\u2019s artisanal mining industry, including children (the country\u2019s population is more than 45 million people). \u201cThey work without adequate protection,\u201d he laments, so that the gold business not only impoverishes them and generates violence, but also makes them sick.\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"As the world embarks on a new wave of technological revolution, digital technology has cemented its significant role in future development. Emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things are being integrated further into industries and society, driving the digital transformation forward. As estimated by the World Economic Forum, 60 percent of global GDP will be digitized by 2022. A study by the Harvard Business Review identified that nearly 72 percent of companies are investing in digital transformation, up from 62 percent in 2020. Digital technology is widely recognized for its capacity to stimulate the global economy.\n\nWithin China, tech companies have been a significant contributor to the economy and social progress in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese companies utilized a variety of technologies to address the public health emergency. According to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology\u2019s data brief, titled \u201cChina\u2019s Use of AI in its COVID-19 Response,\u201d companies of all sizes in AI-related industries in China developed and modified AI systems for pandemic control and prevention.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (JD) deployed self-driving robots in Wuhan to deliver supplies to hospitals treating coronavirus patients. This helped reduce human contact and keep society functioning. Thanks to an AI algorithm developed by the Alibaba DAMO Academy, genetic analyses of possible cases were able to detect virus mutations with a high degree of accuracy. Previously, this process took several hours, but with the help of this algorithm, the time was reduced to half an hour.\n\nIn December 2022, amid the rapid spread of COVID-19 and medication shortages, Tencent launched the \u201cCOVID-19 Protection Drugs Public Welfare and Mutual Aid Platform\u201d mini program to address the rising demand for analgesics and antipyretics. Those in need of medications can submit their information online, making resources readily available to those with dire needs.\n\nGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nAs the world enters the post-pandemic era, China is seeing shifts in policies. During the annual Central Economic Work Conference held in Beijing on December 15 and 16, the committee collectively agreed that the nation\u2019s economic performance is expected to improve next year. China will continue to support technological innovation, green development, and private enterprise, highlighting their central role in reviving the economy, stabilizing employment, and expanding international cooperation.\n\nEnjoying this article?

First, they are digitizing traditional sectors, especially labor-intensive industries, in order to optimize their performances. While China has a relatively solid industrial base, there is still a significant need to introduce digital technology into many traditional industries.\n\nSome Chinese tech giants have started empowering partners in the construction, agriculture, and machinery industries. Tencent Games and Tencent Cloud, in collaboration with Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., created an \u201cImmersive Convergence Digital Factory\u201d using real-time cloud rendering, virtual-reality combination, AR\/VR interaction, and other game technologies. This is the first time that Tencent Games applied its technology to the steel sector, raising standards for remote maintenance, production line operation, and production risk control.\n\nIFlytek is able to diagnose crop diseases and predict the farming environment of crops by utilizing technologies such as speech recognition, image recognition, and big data analysis. It created a platform for intelligent agriculture that lets farmers use digital planting and breeding on a fine scale.\n\nSecond, Chinese tech companies are leveraging digital productivity to upgrade industries across sectors in the real economy. Since the real economy will be China\u2019s focus in pursuing economic growth, the convergence of technology and the real economy will become a rising trend to watch.\n\nThe financial sector serves as a vital component alongside the real economy. Huawei provides robust financial infrastructure, constructs an intelligent architecture, and supports business innovation via its trusted networks, cloud, and databases in order to unleash the digital value of the finance industry. With cloud computing services, financial businesses are able to buy, sell, or distribute a variety of software and digital resources as an on-demand service on the internet, like electricity from a power grid.\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) has ranked Huawei Cloud as the market leader in China\u2019s financial cloud infrastructure in 2021. Meanwhile, Huawei Cloud Stack has ranked first on China\u2019s self-built financial cloud infrastructure market for four years running. This demonstrates Huawei\u2019s major influence in the digital transformation of China\u2019s financial sector.\n\nThe manufacturing sector serves as the backbone of the real economy, fostering economic growth. Tencent WeMake, an industrial internet platform, enables enterprises to build data-driven intelligent factories by modularizing and platformizing the industrial internet of things, cloud-native technology, and digital twins in order to intelligently transform manufacturing production and operations. It enhances the decision-making ability and operational efficiency of manufacturing enterprises.\n\nAccording to Tencent\u2019s Q4 2021 financial report, the revenue from fintech and ToB (business-to-business) services exceeded that from games for the first time, with ToB services as the tech giant\u2019s largest revenue contributor. Tencent\u2019s ToB arm, which empowers the real economy with digital technology, has already become a new profit-generating engine.\n\nChinese technology is taking a unique path that will have implications for both China and the rest of the world. Domestically, the rapid technological development and digital transformation of industries will contribute to China\u2019s economic growth with an increase in employment and wealth. Globally, various nations might look to China for lessons on digital transformation when they try to develop new technological products and services.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"All that cost-cutting at Amazon might be paying off. The company isn\u2019t back to the torrid growth of bygone days but managed to beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter rose 11 percent to $134.4 billion, the retailer said, better than the 9 percent it was achieving recently. That was about $3 billion more than analysts had been forecasting.\n\nNet income was 65 cents a share versus expectations of 35 cents. Last year, the company lost 20 cents a share in the quarter because of a slump in the value of its investment in Rivian, the electric truck maker.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call that the results were helped by reconfiguring the company\u2019s delivery network to put merchandise closer to buyers.\n\n\u201cWhen shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which costs less in transportation, get there faster and is better for the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of goodness in that equation.\u201d\n\nAmazon shares rose more than 10 percent after the earnings were announced. Traders also liked that the company estimated third-quarter revenue would increase 9 to 13 percent and operating income would double. The third quarter includes special annual sale days that usually boost revenue.\n\nJuly signified two years since Mr. Jassy took over as chief executive from Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder. Mr. Jassy\u2019s stewardship so far has been a period of retrenchment. Amazon flourished during the pandemic, supplying necessities and diversions to millions of suddenly grounded families, and the retailer made the reasonable assumption that the boom would last.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. There were layoffs and cutbacks last winter, a time when many big tech companies consolidated swollen operations. The stock fell sharply in 2022 after years of growth. It has since recovered much of the loss but is still below its peak.\n\nSome analysts have worried that Amazon\u2019s recent desire to keep expenses down clashes with its longstanding obsession over making customers happy.\n\nTom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson, wrote a note last week to investors about several disappointments he had experienced with Amazon, including no longer being able to have a defective product picked up without cost by UPS. Now, he wrote, there is a $7.99 fee.\n\n\u201cIn our view, Amazon is playing a \u2018game of chicken\u2019 and banking on other e-commerce companies not to offer a superior service, instead of its historical approach of working backwards with a customer-obsessed approach,\u201d Mr. Forte wrote.\n\nOne of Mr. Bezos\u2019 last major actions before his departure was to add \u201cStrive to be Earth\u2019s best employer\u201d to the company\u2019s leadership principles. \u201cLeaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered?\u201d the principle states.\n\nThe first Amazon union was formed at a warehouse in Staten Island last year, but the company has refused to negotiate with it and is challenging its validity. The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Amazon in July for refusing to bargain. Meanwhile, employees\u2019 return to the office post-pandemic has been unusually contentious for the company.\n\nEmployment appears to have stabilized. Slightly fewer than 1.5 million people work for the company, down 4 percent from a year ago and flat from the prior quarter.\n\nAmazon is so large, with over half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, that it is difficult to move the needle much. In earlier years, the retail division grew like gangbusters. Then the AWS cloud division provided the supercharged growth, and finally advertising pushed the numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see where the next phase of growth will come from. AWS is growing at about a 12 percent annual rate, while online stores were up 4 percent and advertising 22 percent.\n\nMost new programs, like this week\u2019s roll out of grocery service for customers who are not Prime club members, are incremental. Non-Prime members will pay higher delivery fees.\n\nIf the second quarter at Amazon was relatively quiet, the current quarter is likely to produce more in the way of headlines. The Federal Trade Commission is widely expected to file a lawsuit against the company accusing it of violating antitrust laws. A resolution could be years away.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"NEW YORK \u2014 Ben & Jerry\u2019s has been hit with a class action lawsuit and charges of hypocrisy for the use of child labor in its supply chain, despite the ice cream maker\u2019s declared commitment to social justice causes, an image it holds up as a key part of its branding.\n\nThe company\u2019s involvement with child labor came to light shortly after it settled a high-profile legal battle with its parent firm over an attempted boycott against Israel, which Israel supporters viewed as prejudiced. The Ben & Jerry\u2019s board responsible for the boycott has stayed mum about the labor issue, while its leader has continued to take shots at Israel.\n\nThe Vermont-based company claimed in recent filings that it did not use child labor in its supply chain and has avoided divulging when it found out about the matter.\n\nThe labor issue surfaced publicly in a New York Times investigation late last month. The report revealed that American corporations and their suppliers use underage migrant laborers for dangerous and grueling factory jobs, including in dairy facilities that supply Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\n\nMany of the children fled destitution in Central America, arrived in the US as unaccompanied minors, and were then exploited for labor. They work to pay off debts to smugglers, send cash to their families back home, and pay for living costs. The jobs keep many of them out of school. The US Department of Labor said it would take action to rein in illegal child migrant labor in response to the report.\nThe injury rate for dairy facilities is twice the national average compared to all industries, said the report, which included testimony from a boy who crushed his hand in an industrial milking machine in Vermont.\n\nThe state\u2019s labor laws allow anyone over 16 to do any work in agriculture, and bar those under that age from doing any hazardous jobs. There is no evidence that Ben & Jerry\u2019s, or its suppliers, violated labor laws.\n\n\nIllustrative: A worker watches the milking operation at a farm in Fairfield, Vermont, March 5, 2009. (AP Photo\/ Toby Talbot, File)\nA Ben & Jerry\u2019s representative appeared to acknowledge the issue to the New York Times, saying the company cooperated with labor groups to monitor working conditions at its suppliers and claiming that if migrant children needed to work full time, it was better for them to work at a well-monitored workplace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response to the report, a plaintiff filed a federal class action lawsuit against Ben & Jerry\u2019s in a New York court, claiming the company had misrepresented its ethical commitments to consumers.\n\nThe case argues that Ben & Jerry\u2019s charges a premium for its products, partly based on its image as a socially conscious company, and that consumers would not have bought from the company, or paid as much, if they had been aware of its suppliers\u2019 use of child labor. The plaintiff, Dovid Tyrnauer, sought damages and other commitments from Ben & Jerry\u2019s for breach of trust.\n\nDuring the legal proceedings involving the company\u2019s attempted boycott, Ben & Jerry\u2019s repeatedly argued, including in the same New York court where the class action lawsuit was filed, that its conscientious image was a core part of its business strategy and financial success.\n\n\u201cWhile Ben & Jerry\u2019s purports to use ethical supply chains and professes concern about farmworker welfare, the reality could not be further from the truth. Migrant child labor is used in Ben & Jerry\u2019s supply chains,\u201d the lawsuit claimed. \u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s wishes to have its ice cream and eat it too. It wishes to sell premium priced products with pompous virtue-signaling representations regarding its supposedly ethical sourcing, all the while migrant child labor is used in its supply chains. Put simply, this is a case about greed run amok.\u201d\n\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s ice cream on sale at a shop in Jerusalem, on July 19, 2021. (Yonatan Sindel\/ Flash90)\n\u201cThe premiums that consumers pay for allegedly ethically-sourced products, in this instance, are not justified and constitute a breach of consumer trust through the misrepresentations,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawyers for the plaintiff did not respond to a request for comment, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not yet have legal representation listed in the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the New York Times report, Ben & Jerry\u2019s issued a statement opposing child labor and highlighting the company\u2019s ethical commitments and ties with workers\u2019 rights groups. The statement did not deny the use of child labor by the company\u2019s suppliers, or that Ben & Jerry\u2019s was aware of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by the claims made in this story, and do not tolerate any suppliers who are not adhering to the law. Let us be extremely clear: Ben & Jerry\u2019s stands in strong opposition to child labor,\u201d the statement said.\n\nContacted for comment about the class action lawsuit, Ben & Jerry\u2019s referred The Times of Israel to the previous statement, and did not answer specific questions, including about when the company became aware of child workers in its supply chain.\n\n\nImmigrant farm workers sign an agreement with Ben & Jerry\u2019s to promote workers rights in Burlington, Vermont, October 3, 2017. (AP Photo\/Wilson Ring)\nThe company\u2019s prior knowledge of the issue is significant because it certified in filings submitted in January that its suppliers did not use child labor. The disclosure was for the company\u2019s registration as a B Corporation, a private certification that verifies a company\u2019s \u201chigh standards of social and environmental performance.\u201d Ben & Jerry\u2019s also said in 2017 filings that its employee handbook barred the use of child labor.\n\nThe Ben & Jerry\u2019s independent board tasked with protecting the company\u2019s \u201csocial mission,\u201d which decided to boycott Israeli settlements, has not commented on the child labor issue. A company spokesperson said the statement responding to the New York Times investigation was not attributable to the board.\n\nThe board\u2019s chair, Anuradha Mittal, has not publicly commented, but has repeatedly shared anti-Israel content on Twitter since the child labor issue came to light.

Israeli laws bar discrimination against citizens based on where they live, meaning a boycott of settlements would amount to a ban on selling anywhere in Israel.\n\n\nPro-Israel demonstrators protest against Ben and Jerry\u2019s over its boycott of the West Bank, and against antisemitism, in New York City, on August 12, 2021. (Luke Tress\/Flash90)\nThe decision set off a convoluted legal battle and heavy repercussions for Unilever, the Ben & Jerry\u2019s parent company, as US states enacted anti-BDS divestment laws, pulling hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from the UK conglomerate.\n\nThe ice cream maker\u2019s decision to boycott \u201coccupied territory\u201d sparked uproar in Israel and among some US Jewish groups. Critics of the boycott argued it was antisemitic because the company has never attempted to boycott any other region of the world.\n\nSupporters of the boycott Israel movement say that in urging businesses, artists, and universities to sever ties with Israel, they are using nonviolent means to oppose unjust policies toward Palestinians. Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize and destroy the Jewish state.\n\nZinger and Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel refused to comply with the settlement boycott, arguing it was illegal under Israeli and US law. Their license to sell the ice cream was only set to expire at the end of 2022, meaning the boycott never went into effect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nWorkers at the Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel factory near Kiryat Malakhi, July 21, 2021.

Months later, Unilever settled with Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel, granting the Israeli branch independence to sell its products indefinitely in Israel and the West Bank, using Hebrew and Arabic branding. Under the agreement, Ben & Jerry\u2019s has no authority over the Israeli franchise.\n\nUnilever has said the board had announced the settlement boycott without consulting with the parent company.\n\nShortly after that agreement was announced, Ben & Jerry\u2019s sought to block the deal by suing Conopco, the main US branch of Unilever, arguing that Unilever had breached its acquisition deal with Ben & Jerry\u2019s. The unusual 2000 merger agreement gave the ice cream maker\u2019s board the authority to protect the company\u2019s \u201csocial mission.\u201d The lawsuit marked an unprecedented legal dispute between a major company and its parent corporation.\n\nUnilever said it had resolved its dispute with Ben & Jerry\u2019s in December without specifying the terms of the agreement. The case had appeared to be going against Ben & Jerry\u2019s before the deal was announced.\n\nZinger said he was \u201cpleased\u201d the litigation had been resolved, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s and its board did not comment.\n\nThe Jewish founders of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, who no longer run the company, have said Unilever \u201cusurped their authority\u201d by spinning off the Israel branch.\n\nThe case has illustrated the pitfalls of progressive corporate activism, the risks for companies attempting to boycott Israel and the growing role of corporate investing in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute in the US.","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russia kept one of its main gas supply routes to Europe shut on Saturday, stoking fears of winter fuel shortages and spotlighting differences between Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Germany's Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) over repair work on the pipeline.\n\nAlready struggling to tame soaring gas prices, European governments had expected the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to resume flows after a short maintenance this week but Russia abruptly cancelled the restart, citing an oil leak in a turbine.\n\nEurope has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in what Moscow has called an \"economic war\" with the West over the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions.\n\nThe latest Nord Stream shutdown, which Russia says will last for as long as it takes to carry out repairs, added to fears of winter gas shortages that could help tip major economies into recession and energy rationing.\n\nThe discovery of the oil leak on Friday coincided with the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies proceeding with plans to impose a price gap on Russian oil, intending to shrink President Vladimir Putin's resources to fight the war in Ukraine.\n\nGas shortages also prompted European Union member Sweden on Saturday to unveil a financial support package for energy firms.\n\n\"If we do not act, there is a serious risk of disruptions in the financial system, which in the worst case could lead to a financial crisis,\" said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.\n\n\"Putin wants to create division, but our message is clear: you will not succeed,\" she said.\n\nGAS PRICE RALLY EXPECTED\nGazprom said Siemens Energy was ready to carry out repairs on the pipeline but that there was nowhere available to carry out the work, a suggestion Siemens Energy denied, saying it had not been asked to do the job.\n\nSiemens Energy has also said that sanctions do not prohibit maintenance.\n\nBefore the latest round of maintenance, Gazprom had already cut flows to just 20% of the pipeline's capacity.\n\n\"Siemens is taking part in repair work in accordance with the current contract, is detecting malfunctions ... and is ready to fix the oil leaks. Only there is nowhere to do the repair,\" Gazprom said in a statement on its Telegram channel on Saturday.\n\nSiemens Energy said it had not been commissioned to carry out the work but was available, adding that the Gazprom-reported leak would not usually affect the operation of a turbine and could be sealed on site.\n\n\"Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several times that there are enough additional turbines available in the Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nFlows through Nord Stream 1 were due to resume early on Saturday morning. But hours before it was set to start pumping gas, Gazprom published a photo on Friday of what it said was an oil leak on a piece of equipment.\n\nSiemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment at Nord Stream 1's Portovaya compressor station said on Friday the leak did not constitute a technical reason to stop gas flows.\n\n\n\"Global natural gas prices will likely rally hard on Monday as markets readjust to this latest #Gazprom development,\" Tom Marzec-Manser, Head of Gas Analytics at ICIS, said on twitter.\n\n\"The closure of #NordStream1 reduces overall Russian pipeline flows yet further and will make balancing supply & demand this winter all the more difficult.\"\n\nAsked about the halt on Saturday, Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said that the European Union expects Russia to respect its agreed energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if Moscow fails to do so. read more\n\nThe German network regulator said that the country's gas supply was currently guaranteed but the situation was fragile and further deterioration could not be ruled out.\n\n\"The defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the halt of operations,\" it said.\n\nWholesale gas prices have rocketed more than 400% since August 2021, squeezing households already gripped by a cost-of-living crisis and forcing some energy hungry industries, such as fertiliser and aluminium makers, to scale back production.\n\nThe European Commission has said a full cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Europe, if combined with a cold winter, could reduce average EU gross domestic product by up to 1.5% if countries did not prepare in advance.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"Consumer spending held up well in July as inflation slowed, with retail sales turning in a stronger-than-expected showing for the month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.\n\nThe advanced retail sales report showed a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.7% for the month, better than the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding autos, sales rose a robust 1%, also against a 0.4% forecast. Both readings were the best monthly gains since January.\n\nAs the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, they showed a consumer able to keep ahead of price increases that have been prevalent over the past two years. The consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month, indicating solid demand.\n\nJuly\u2019s numbers were boosted by a 1.9% jump in spending at online retailers, while sporting goods and related stores increased 1.5% and food service and drinking places rose 1.4%.\n\nOn the downside, furniture sales slumped 1.8% and electronics and appliance stores reported a 1.3% drop. Gas station sales rose just 0.4% on the month despite rising prices at the pump.\n\nThe report adds to the narrative that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a much-predicted recession brought on by a series of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation.\n\nIn a series of 11 increases since March 2022, the central bank has taken up its key borrowing rate by 5.25 percentage points to hits highest level in more than 22 years. Regardless, consumers, who power about two-thirds of the entire $26.8 trillion U.S. economy, have persevered.\n\n\u201cDespite the additional pressure put on the Fed, Americans\u2019 sustained ability to spend speaks to the strength of the US economy in the face of global economic challenges,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at the Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.\n\nAs saving has begun to dry up, shoppers have shown a willingness to use credit cards, the balances of which exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nJuly\u2019s data showed that spending was widespread, with most categories showing increases. However, motor vehicle sales fell 0.3% as well. On a 12-month basis, sales rose 3.2%, which is exactly in line with the annual increase in the CPI.\n\nA separate report Tuesday, however, showed that inflation pressures linger after hitting their highest level in more than 40 years in the summer of 2022.\n\nImport prices moved 0.4% higher in July, higher than the 0.2% estimate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was only the second monthly gain in 2023, as the year-over-year rate declined 4.4%. A year ago, the annual increase was 8.8%.\n\nVirtually all of the increase came from a 3.6% rise in imported fuel prices. Import prices were unchanged when excluding fuel, according to the BLS.\n\nExport prices, though, rose even more, gaining 0.7% on the month. However, they are down 7.9% from a year ago, after surging 12.9% from July 2021 to July 2022.\n\n\u201cConsumers spent with vigor in July, perhaps with a sense of relief that inflation is fading even in the absence of recession or extensive job losses,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \u201cIs a soft landing still on the table?

{"text":"OSLO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Norway's $1.4 trillion wealth fund, the world's single largest stock market investor, is urging firms it invests in to engage with artificial intelligence as a way to drive profits, but to do so responsibly, top officials told Reuters.\n\nFund CEO Nicolai Tangen said it was crucial for all firms in its portfolio to engage with AI, as it is \"potentially a massive driver for productivity and efficiency\" that is becoming an everyday business tool like power, computers or the internet.\n\n\"We of course expect them to use AI for the best possible benefit of the business,\" Tangen said in an interview. \"AI is a huge opportunity for companies and for society, but we need to make sure that it is used in the right way.\"\n\nTangen said a company that would not engage with AI \"would disqualify themselves as being complete morons\".\n\nThe fund invests in 9,200 firms worldwide, for which it sets expectations on a range of issues, from children's rights to climate change.\n\nIts latest document, to be published Wednesday, is on consumers' interests, with a heavy focus on AI.\n\nWhen talking to firms about responsible AI, the fund will concentrate particularly on the healthcare, finance and large tech sectors, because their use of the technology will have an especially strong impact on consumers.\n\nCompanies must be able to explain why they are developing particular AI systems and how they have been designed, trained and tested, according to the document. There should also be effective human oversight and control.\n\n\nThat is so \"people (who) are affected by the outcomes can actually go back to the company and ask 'how does your algorithm work? Why did I not get the loan?'\", said Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief governance and compliance officer.\n\nAmong other expectations set in the document, the fund said companies must be proactive in their management of AI-related risks, and have systems in place if or when things go wrong.\n\nSpecial responsibility lies with the top tech companies that develop AI technology since they are driving the change, said the fund, a top ten investor in Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O).\n\n\"They have to take responsibility for their development and use of AI,\" said Smith Ihenacho, adding the fund had already discussed AI with the large U.S. tech companies in its portfolio.\n\n\"We have done it and we will continue to do it,\" she said.\n\nShe welcomed recent self-regulation moves by U.S. tech giants as \"a good start\", but noted that there were \"no proper regulations in place yet\" and that more was needed.\n\nIn July, U.S. AI companies made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to make the technology safer.\n\n\"That is where there is room for investors like us to come in and fill the gap,\" said Smith Ihenacho.\n\nTech is the largest sector in the fund's equity investments, representing 11.9% of the its total value at end-2022, its data showed.\n\nDialogue with companies and voting at annual general meetings is the focus of its environment, social and governance (ESG) approach, but the fund can, and does, divest from companies that do not comply with its requirements. Last year it divested from 74 firms on those grounds.","labels":["investments"]}

Volumes began declining sharply in September and were already close to 2019 levels by the end of last year. They\u2019re expected to pull even with pre-COVID numbers this month and next.\n\nThe \u201cpandemic-driven surge [is] finally over,\u201d said the National Retail Federation (NRF).\n\nThe NRF publishes the monthly Port Tracker report together with Hackett Associates. \u201cImport patterns appear to be returning to what was normal prior to 2020,\u201d said Hackett Associates founder Ben Hackett.\n\nPort Tracker covers 12 U.S. ports. While final counts are not in yet, it estimated the ports it covers handled 1.88 million twenty-foot equivalent units in December, down 10.1% year on year. \n\nPort Tracker forecasts that import volumes in January and February will be roughly even with pre-COVID levels then will bounce back above them again in March-May.\n\n\nVolumes through November 2022 are final counts; December 2022-May 2023 are projected. (Chart: FreightWaves based on data from National Retail Federation)\nAnother data provider, Descartes, reported imports for all U.S. ports totaled 1,929,032 TEUs in December, just 1.3% higher than imports in December 2019, pre-COVID.\n\nLast month\u2019s imports were down 19.3% year on year and down 1.3% versus November, according to Descartes.\n\nCountrywide volumes are close to pre-boom levels, but there are still some big differences.\n\nOcean schedules have improved, but delays remain higher than they used to be. In the first week of January, the Flexport Ocean Timeliness Indicator for the Asia-U.S. route was still 25% higher than three years ago.\n\nThe coastal mix is also much different. Ports on the East and Gulf coasts continue to handle significantly higher volumes than before the pandemic. Volumes on the West Coast are much lower than they used to be. \n\nA new West Coast dockworker labor contract has still not been signed, over seven months after the last one expired.\n\n\n\u201cThe continuing labor uncertainty could be a significant reason why import volumes are not shifting back to major California ports despite their improving situation,\u201d said Chris Jones, executive vice president of industry and services at Descartes.\n\nThe COVID-19 situation in China presents another ongoing complication for supply chains. \u201cCOVID infection is widespread and given that the Chinese population has little to no immunity, the impact of COVID on manufacturing supply chains could continue for quite some time,\u201d noted Jones.\n\nThere could also be another inventory effect ahead \u2014 this time in the opposite direction. In 2022, importers brought in too much; at some point in 2023, they may find they have too little.\n\n\u201cPeople \u2026 will see that underlying consumer demand is actually relatively healthy and all of a sudden, they\u2019ll become concerned that their inventories are a bit on the low end and we\u2019ll possibly see a bounce-back,\u201d said Hapag-Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen last year.\n\nHackett predicted, \u201cAs inflation eases and consumer spending returns, we project that growth will slowly return going into the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"In the Asia-Pacific region, Sky One FZE is observing significant trends that can impact cargo volume growth.\nIndia Business\n\n| Written By\n\nBulbul Dhawan\n\nAir cargo movement: India is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the movement of air cargo, said Jaideep Mirchandani, Chairman of global aviation conglomerate Sky One FZE in an interview with Republic. Asserting that India's air freight market is estimated to stand at $13.08 billion (Rs 1.09 lakh crore) in 2023, he said that by 2028, it is expected to reach $17.22 billion (Rs 1.43 lakh crore) at a CAGR of 5.65 per cent.\n\n\u201cWith the country's rapidly growing economy and increasing trade activities, India is poised to become a crucial player in the global logistics landscape. Key regions that are expected to drive this growth include major industrial hubs such as Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, and Bengaluru, as well as emerging logistics centers in Gujarat and Hyderabad,\u201d he said.\n\nMirchandani also stated that in the Asia-Pacific region, Sky One FZE is observing significant trends that can impact cargo volume growth. \u201cThe rise of e-commerce, especially in countries like India and China, is driving a notable surge in demand for air cargo transportation. According to IATA, global e-commerce is predicted to exceed $7.4 trillion by 2025, indicating the immense potential for cargo movement in the region. Additionally, the development of multimodal logistics hubs and advancements in technology are improving supply chain efficiency and promoting seamless cargo movement in the region,\u201d he said.\n\nGlobal trade dynamics and air cargo movement in India\n\nAccording to Mirchandani, India's air cargo movement is greatly influenced by global trade dynamics, rapid technological advancements, and evolving consumer behaviors. As international trade patterns evolve, India's strategic geographical location places it in a prime position to serve as a transit point for goods moving between Asia, Europe, and Africa, he asserted. \u201cAccording to reports, India substituted China as the emerging market with maximum potential to grow and increase revenue, which reflects the country's strong growth in the economy which will drive demand and consequently air cargo movement. Technological advancements are driving efficiency gains in cargo handling, tracking, and documentation, while changing consumer behaviors are shaping the demand for specialised and express cargo services,\u201d he said.\n\nNational Logistics Policy\n\nThe focus on improving airport facilities and connectivity will enhance India's capacity to handle export and import cargo, making it more competitive in the global trade landscape, he opined. \u201cThe National Logistics Policy emphasises the development of multimodal logistics hubs enabling smoother cargo movement across different regions. This integrated approach will enhance connectivity, reduce transit times, and improve overall logistics efficiency,\u201d he said, adding that the policy's focus on infrastructure development, including dedicated freight corridors and Multimodal Logistic Parks (MMLPs), will enhance the transportation network and facilitate seamless cargo operations. \u201cForty air cargo terminals have been constructed and 30 airports have been provided cold-storage facilities across India for promoting export. This is surely going to boost the demand and efficiency of air cargo in the region,\u201d he explained.\n\nFirst Published:\n\nCOMMENT\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO US\n\nWATCH US LIVE\n\nFOLLOW US\n\n4 weeks ago\n\nHow Indigo tweaked operations to deliver consistently for 17 years and remain profitable\n\nid:4394_12001185\n\nesg\n09:06 | \n\nCountry\nIndia\nWords\n239\nMotoGP: First batch of bikes, equipment cargo shipment lands in India\nThe race is scheduled to be held at the Buddh International Circuit between September 22-24.\nThe first batch of MotoGP equipments have touched down at Delhi airport. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement\n\nWith just a week left for the race, the first batch of equipments for MotoGP Bharat arrived at the Buddh International Circuit on Thursday.

{"text":"David Maloni has worked in food supply-chain data analysis for more than a quarter century. But he has never seen a situation with eggs quite like the one playing out across the country right now.\n\nA nationwide egg shortage sparked by a deadly avian influenza outbreak is causing empty shelves and soaring prices, prompting some grocers to limit the number of eggs shoppers can purchase.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever seen prices like this before,\u201d said Maloni, who is a commodity and food supply-chain consultant and president of Sarasota, Florida-based Datum FS. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d\n\nEgg prices were up more than 225% in December over the year before, surging from $1.47 for a dozen large eggs in 2021 to $4.79 a dozen 12 months later. Overall food-at-home prices were up 12% in November, according to federal data. December\u2019s Consumer Price Index numbers are slated to be released Thursday.\n\n\nThe high prices were fueled by soaring demand for eggs for holiday baking, a normal seasonal fluctuation that was magnified by the impact of the bird flu outbreak.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 57.8 million animals are known to have been infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses since January 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes 728 reported outbreaks among wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard or hobbyist flocks in 47 states, the agency said.\n\nEgg-laying chickens have made up the majority of the birds slaughtered in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThose outbreaks have stalled fall egg production by about 5% compared with the same period last year, Maloni said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a time when we have our biggest seasonal increase in demand,\u201d he said.\n\nEgg supply headaches have been especially severe in Colorado, where a state law that went into effect Jan. 1 requires all locally raised chickens to be cage-free if the eggs will be sold in stores. The law is being phased in and will be fully implemented by 2025.\n\nAccording to local reports around the country, a number of grocers are limiting egg purchases to two cartons per customer, including Fred Meyer in Anchorage, Alaska, and a Whole Foods Market in Denver.\n\nThe egg shelves were nearly bare at a Target store on the Northwest Side of Chicago earlier this week, with the few cartons of organic eggs available selling for $7.99 a dozen.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson told WGB that the retail giant had not imposed any egg purchase limits, despite ongoing supply chain challenges.\n\n\u201cHigher demand leading up to the holidays and the impact of avian flu caused tighter supply,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, now demand has returned to normal levels.\u201d\n\nThere are some reasons for sunny side-up optimism in the egg pipeline, Maloni said.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture is forecasting egg production in 2023 to be about 5% higher than the year before and about 2% higher than it was in 2021 and 2020, he noted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good if we can get there,\u201d Maloni said. \u201cThat\u2019s good but it\u2019s probably not good enough.\u201d\n\nWith the holiday season over, demand for eggs will slow. And so too should prices.\n\n\u201cTypically, some of the highest prices will be in December, and then the market will come off about 10% to 20% in January compared to December,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the highest prices hopefully are behind us.\u201d\n\nEgg supply, however, is another story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a little while for it to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should see some of that seasonal decline, but it\u2019s going to take a while for supplies to normalize.\u201d\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 The Christmas blizzard of 2022 is long in the rearview mirror for a lot of people in Western New York, particularly as we languish in the heat of the August sun. \n\nOfficials with the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, however, are analyzing their response to the historic storm. \n\n\nOverall, 47 people were killed in the longest lasting blizzard below an altitude of 5,000 feet. Blizzard conditions engulfed Western New York around 8:45 a.m. on Friday, December 23 and lasted until Tuesday, December 27. \n\nOn Christmas, the storm shifted from a blizzard to a lake effect snow event. \n\nThe 33-page report, released by NYSDHSES, stated that 50 interviews were conducted and over 1,300 pages of relevant documents were reviewed. \n\nThe report highlighted poor communication, language and coordination as areas that impacted the states response. \n\nIt also points to the public underestimating the severity of the storm. \n\n\"When the storm that would become the Blizzard of \u201922 was initially forecast, it is possible that some WNY residents underestimated the need to prepare, given the recent relative ease of storm experience in November 2022,\" the report said. \n\nRegarding communication, the report highlights that the state did not use its NY-Alert system \"due to a low subscriber base.\"\n\nNY-Alert is a platform that users can receive emergency alerts from the state via phone, email, text or fax. \n\nOther communication that needs review is the way state agencies phrased announcements to the public. For example, the report highlights a communication by the NYSDOT for motorists to \"heed all warnings.\"\n\n\"A reference to 'heed all warnings' could have been enhanced by referring to the specific rules in place at that time,\" the report said. \n\nThe issue of the travel ban was a topic conversation and finger pointing in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The state report doesn't outright indicate a state travel ban should have been initiated earlier, but rather points to the evolving forecast as the reason why it wasn't.  \n\n\"This ban was enacted after inclement conditions appeared in the early morning, instead of Friday afternoon as the State planned for based on Thursday night\u2019s forecast. The midmorning travel ban meant that some drivers were still on the roads or had planned to be on the roads that day \u2013 even as the weather quickly deteriorated.\"\n\n\nAccording to the report, various state agencies rescued 649 people from the roads at the height of the blizzard. One recommendation in the report is for more state roads installing barriers. \n\n\"The State should consider the feasibility of adding additional barriers on roads that do not already have them, to allow for greater enforcement of travel bans.\"\n\nState officials did cite that Erie County was not using a current version of standard emergency management software. The report states that \"there were still usability challenges for response staff\" because the county uses an older version. \n\nErie County executive Mark Poloncarz rebuffed that conclusion in the report and said that \"there are no compatibility issues.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to 2 On Your Side, the county executive said:\n\n\"Erie County was proud to participate in New York State's After Action Report of the Christmas Blizzard by providing full access to all key county personnel involved in the storm response. We will be incorporating any relevant findings into our very active winter storm preparation process that is already well underway.\"\n\nBuffalo Mayor Brown, or anyone else from the administration, was unavailable for an interview regarding the report. Mayor Brown's office sent a statement saying:\n\n\"The Mayor is aware the State's After Action Report for the response to the December Blizzard is completed. City staff participated in the process as requested and we are currently reviewing the document. As previously announced, the City has established a Storm Response Task Force and has already purchased new equipment and adopted new storm-fighting procedures.\"\n\nOverall the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services didn't give itself a passing or failing grade in regards to their response to the blizzard. But the state acknowledges areas where agencies are working in silos and more collaboration is needed. \n\n\n\"The system cannot improve in isolation. Going forward, state agency partners, along with local officials should work towards an improved state emergency management through intentional communication.\"","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"Hong Kong\nCNN\n \u2014 \nWith parts of China experiencing record high temperatures and heavy rains, reports of farm animals and crops suffering from extreme weather patterns are dominating headlines in the country, raising concerns about food security in the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nChina experienced its worst heat wave and drought in decades during the summer of 2022, which caused widespread power shortages and disrupted food and industrial supply chains. This year, extreme heat has ravaged many parts of the country even earlier than last year.\n\nPigs, rabbits and fish have been dying from the searing temperatures, and wheat fields in central China have been flooded by the heaviest rainfall in a decade. Meanwhile, officials are worried that drought could hit the Yangtze River basin, China\u2019s main rice-growing region, in the coming months.\n\nSince March, temperatures in dozens of Chinese cities have hit record seasonal highs. The heat wave has escalated in recent days, with a number of cities in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces suffering record-breaking temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nBy Wednesday, 578 national weather stations located in different cities across the country recorded their highest ever temperatures for this time of year, according to the China Meteorological Administration.\n\n\u201cExtreme weather such as drought and floods may disrupt the food production order and bring more uncertainties to the supply of food and oil,\u201d Sheng Xia, chief agricultural analyst for Citic Securities, wrote in a research report on Wednesday.\n\nHe warned of increasing threats to food security this year because of the looming El Ni\u00f1o, a natural phenomenon in the tropical Pacific Ocean that brings warmer-than-average temperatures. El Ni\u00f1o could, for the first time, push the world past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above the pre-industrial levels of the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\n\u201cFor China, the El Ni\u00f1o event will easily lead to increased climate uncertainty in the Yangtze River Basin, causing flooding in the south and drought in the north, and cold summer in the northeast,\u201d said Sheng.\n\nTourists holding umbrellas visit Shanghai during a heat wave on May 29, 2023. The city recently recorded its highest May temperature in more than 100 years.\nTourists holding umbrellas visit Shanghai during a heat wave on May 29, 2023. The city recently recorded its highest May temperature in more than 100 years.\nWang Gang\/VCG\/Getty Images\nLast month, the World Meteorological Organization said the likelihood of El Ni\u00f1o developing later this year was increasing.\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s severe heat wave and drought, Beijing strengthened its focus on food security. In March, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said agriculture was the foundation of national security.\n\n\u201cOnce something\u2019s wrong with agriculture, our bowls will be held in someone else\u2019s hands and we\u2019ll have to depend on others for food. How can we achieve modernization in that case?\u201d he said in an article published in March by Qiushi, the Communist Party\u2019s main theoretical journal.\n\nAnimals killed\nIn recent days, reports of farm animals killed by extreme heat have dominated the news.\n\nAt a farm in eastern Jiangsu province, hundreds of pigs died this week after a sudden power outage caused fans to stop working at night, according to several state media reports.\n\nThe pigs suffocated to death amid extreme heat and poor air circulation, Jimu News, a government-owned news website, cited an unnamed employee at the farm as saying.\n\nThe heat wave was blamed for killing large numbers of farmed carp living in rice fields in the southwestern region of Guangxi. Villagers told the South of China Today newspaper on Wednesday that their fish were \u201cburned to death\u201d as water temperatures soared due to hot weather.\n\nThe prices of rabbit heads, a signature dish in Sichuan, have surged in recent days as high temperatures caused rabbit deaths on farms, resulting in tighter supply. Spicy rabbit heads are a popular street food in the southwestern province, where residents consume more than 200 million of the heads a year, according to industry association figures.\n\nCrops damaged\nExtreme weather conditions have also affected the country\u2019s largest wheat-growing region.\n\nHeavy rainfall flooded the wheat fields of Henan, a central province which accounts for a quarter of China\u2019s production, in the last week of May, just days before harvest time. The rains caused some grain crops to sprout or go moldy. The ruined crop accounted for 20% of some farmers\u2019 yields for the whole year, according to the state-run China Media Group.\n\nA farmer harvests wheat in Pingdingshan, Henan province, on May 30, 2023.\nA farmer harvests wheat in Pingdingshan, Henan province, on May 30, 2023.\nShi Guangming\/VCG\/Getty Images\nIt was said to be the worst rainfall taking place near harvest season in more than a decade. And more extreme weather events are likely to come.\n\nFrom May to September, \u201cdrought and flooding might occur simultaneously,\u201d with more extreme climate events such as heavy rainfall and heat waves hitting the country, according to a recent estimate by the national climate center.\n\nSheng noted that the heat wave and lack of rainfall in the far western region of Xinjiang had already affected some corn and wheat production.\n\nIn the next few months, precipitation in the middle reaches of the mighty Yangtze River, which bisects the country, may be significantly reduced, according to an official estimate. That could lead to a drought and affect the region\u2019s rice crops, he said.\n\nThe Yangtze River basin provides more than two thirds of China\u2019s rice, a major food staple at home and abroad.\n\nRELATED\n","labels":["natural_disasters"]}

{"text":"Arque Capital Ltd. filed its termination letter with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. last month, according to the firm\u2019s BrokerCheck profile. The firm had just $6 million in RIA assets, according to its Form ADV, and nine client accounts.\n\nArque Capital\u2019s interim president and CEO, Audrey Kuwabara, did not return messages Thursday to comment.\n\nIn May, Kuwabara and two other executives at the firm settled an investor complaint involving GWG bonds for $230,000, according to her BrokerCheck profile. The client\u2019s claims were \u201cwithout merit\u201d and the executives denied any allegations, according to Kuwabara\u2019s response about the matter on her BrokerCheck report.\n\nArque Capital opened in 2005, according to Finra, and has four disclosure issues on its BrokerCheck report. In one of those issues, which resulted in a $50,000 fine in 2014, the firm said it was the broker-dealer manager for renewable, secured debentures issued by GWG Holdings; the fine was related to allegedly faulty information in a sales brochure.\n\nArque Capital is not the first broker-dealer linked to GWG bonds to hit such a hard patch. JRL Capital Corp., a small broker-dealer based in Irvine, California, which also sold the defunct GWG bonds, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy May 2 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California.\n\nA plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Jeff Erez, said he has about 20 investor claims against broker-dealers that sold GWG bonds, which were backed by life settlements, but none against Arque Capital, although he did take a close look at the firm.\n\n\u201cI looked at [Arque Capital\u2019s] financials and they were horrible,\u201d Erez said. \u201cBut GWG bonds were sold by hundreds of broker-dealers.\u201d\n\nAfter missing payments to investors, GWG Holdings filed for bankruptcy in April 2022. The company sold $1.6 billion in bonds backed by life settlements through a network of independent broker-dealers. It\u2019s not clear what value, if any, those bonds currently have.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chatter about what the recovery rate for clients who own GWG bonds could be, maybe 15 to 25 cents on the dollar is the range discussed,\u201d Erez added.\n\nSmall broker-dealers like Arque Capital are susceptible to problems when products, particularly high-risk, high-commission alternative investments, go sideways.\n\nIn Arque Capital\u2019s March financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it had errors and omissions insurance and was using it to cover the costs of defending itself against an investor claim. However, the firm does not mention pending litigation stemming from sales of GWG bonds in that SEC filing.\n","labels":["financial_distress","investments"]}
{"text":"New York\nCNN\n \u2014 \nBed Bath & Beyond, the store for seemingly everything in your home during the 1990s and 2000s, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThank you to all of our loyal customers. We have made the difficult decision to begin winding down our operations,\u201d a statement at the top of the company\u2019s website said Sunday morning.\n\nThe company\u2019s 360 Bed Bath & Beyond locations, along with its 120 buybuy BABY stores, will remain open for now, as will websites. The company secured a $240 million loan to help fund its operations during bankruptcy.\n\nBut store closing sales will begin Wednesday, and Bed Bath & Beyond will close some stores. Just how many \u2013 or what happens to its 14,000 employees \u2013depends on what happens next.\n\nA bankruptcy filing does not necessarily mean that a company is going out of business. Many major US companies have filed for bankruptcy, using it to shed debt and other costs they could no longer afford. But even if Bed Bath and Beyond does emerge from bankruptcy, its future is not guaranteed.\n\nThe company said it would seek to sell some or all of its business. If it\u2019s able to find a buyer, Bed Bath & Beyond will halt store closings. But if a buyer doesn\u2019t come forward, Bed Bath & Beyond will likely be liquidated entirely and go out of business.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the company could emerge from bankruptcy as an online-only retailer, said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if it emerges from bankruptcy at all, Bed Bath & Beyond will be a shadow of its former self,\u201d he said.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond had been a crown jewel of the era of so-called \u201ccategory killers\u201d \u2014 chains that dominated a category of retail, such as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Circuit City and Sports Authority. Those companies, too, ultimately filed for bankruptcy as shoppers turned away from huge specialty stores in favor of online options like Amazon.\n\nChris Hammons unloads a bag of items she purchased at a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Dallas, Texas September 23, 2009. \nChris Hammons unloads a bag of items she purchased at a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Dallas, Texas September 23, 2009.\nJessica Rinaldi\/Reuters\nBed Bath & Beyond became known for pots and pans, towels and bedding stacked from the floor to the ceiling at its cavernous stores \u2014 and for its ubiquitous 20%-off coupons. The blue-and-white coupons became something of a pop culture symbol, and millions of Americans wound up stashing them away in their cars, closets and basements.\n\nThe company said customers will have Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to use their remaining 20%-off coupons. The company will stop accepting them Wednesday. Instead, Bed Bath & Beyond expects to offer \u201cdeep discounts\u201d on its products as part of its going-out-of-business sales.\n\nThe retailer attracted a broad range of customers by selling name brands at cut-rate prices. Brands coveted a spot on Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s shelves, knowing it would lead to big sales. Plus, the open-store layout encouraged impulse buying: Shoppers would come in to buy new dishes and walk out with pillows, towels and other items.\n\nStores were a fixture for shoppers around the winter holidays and during the back-to-school and college seasons, and Bed Bath & Beyond also had a strong baby and wedding registry business.\n\nBut the New Jersey-based company has been slow to respond to shopping changes and struggled to entice customers who had moved on to Amazon, Target and other chains.\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond said it had $5.2 billion in debt and assets of just $4.4 billion. It secured $240 million in financing Sunday to stay afloat just long enough to close its stores and wind down its operations.\n\nThe company encouraged shoppers to seek out its discounted merchandise later this week. Items purchased before Wednesday can be returned until May 24, but all sales after Wednesday will be final. The store will stop accepting gift cards on May 8.\n\nSuperstore era\nFounded in 1971 by Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, two veterans of the discount retail industry in Springfield, New Jersey, the chain of small linen and bath stores \u2014 then called Bed \u2018n Bath \u2014 first grew around the northeast and in California selling designer bedding, a new trend at the time. Unlike department stores, it didn\u2019t rely on sales events to draw in customers.\n\nThe company changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987 to reflect its expanded merchandise and bigger \u201csuperstores.\u201d The company went public in 1992 with 38 stores and around $200 million in sales.\n\n\u201cWe had witnessed the department store shakeout and knew that specialty stores were going to be the next wave of retailing,\u201d Feinstein said in 1993. \u201cIt was the beginning of the designer approach to linens and housewares and we saw a real window of opportunity.\u201d\n\nCustomers examining items in shopping carts at a Bed, Bath & Beyond store in New York City on January 18, 1994.\nCustomers examining items in shopping carts at a Bed, Bath & Beyond store in New York City on January 18, 1994.\nMark Peterson\/Corbis\/Getty Images\nBy 2000, those figures leapt to 241 stores and $1.1 billion in annual sales. The 1,000th Bed Bath & Beyond store opened in 2009, when the chain had reached $7.8 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe company was something of an iconoclast. It spent little on advertising, relying instead on print coupons distributed in weekly newspapers to attract customers.\n\n\u201cWhy not just tell the customer that we\u2019ll give you a discount on the item you want \u2014 and not the one that we want to put on sale? We\u2019ll mail a coupon, and it will be a lot cheaper,\u201d Eisenberg said in a 2020 New York Times interview.\n\nThe chain was known for giving autonomy to store managers to decide which products to stock, allowing them to customize their individual stores, and for shipping products directly to stores instead of a central warehouse.\n\nThe rise of online shopping\nBut as brick-and-mortar began to give way to e-commerce, Bed Bath & Beyond was slow to make the transition \u2014 a misstep compounded by the fact that home decor is one of the most commonly bought categories online.\n\n\u201cWe missed the boat on the internet,\u201d Eisenberg said in a recent Wall Street Journal interview. (The co-founders are no longer involved with the company.)\n\nOnline shopping weakened the allure of Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s fan-favorite coupons, too, because consumers could find plenty of cheaper alternatives on Amazon or browse a wider selection on sites like Wayfair (W).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Amazon and online shopping that sank Bed Bath & Beyond, however.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) have grown over the past decade, and they have been able to draw Bed Bath & Beyond customers with lower prices and a wider array of merchandise. Discount chains such as HomeGoods and TJ Maxx have also undercut Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s prices.\n\nWithout the differentiators of the lowest prices or widest selection, Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s sales stagnated from 2012 to 2019.\n\nShoppers inspect cleaning supplies while shopping inside of a Bed Bath & Beyond store in New York April 13, 2011.\nShoppers inspect cleaning supplies while shopping inside of a Bed Bath & Beyond store in New York April 13, 2011.\nLucas Jackson\/Reuters\nThen the pandemic hit in 2020. The company temporarily closed all of its stores while rivals deemed \u201cessential retailers\u201d like Walmart remained open. Sales sank 17% in 2020 and 15% in 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Bed Bath & Beyond has rotated through several different executives and turnaround strategies in recent years.\n\nFormer Target executive Mark Tritton took the helm in 2019 with backing from investors and a bold new strategy. He scaled back coupons and inventory from national brands in favor of Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s own private-label brands.\n\nBut this change alienated customers who were loyal to big brands. The company also fell behind on payments to vendors, and stores did not have enough merchandise to stock shelves. Tritton stepped down as CEO in 2022.\n\nScramble to avoid bankruptcy\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy for months.\n\nIn February, it was able to stave off bankruptcy by completing a complex stock offering that gave it both an immediate injection of cash and a pledge for more funding in the future to pay down its debt.

{"text":"Disruption in the automotive industry seems a near-constant force these days. The automotive supply chain continues to suffer hangover challenges from the pandemic (including raw materials shortages and increased labor costs), reduced volumes, stops and starts in OEM production orders and rising interest rates. Despite this, carmakers continue to record rising profits. These factors impact automotive suppliers in particular as many struggle with reduced margins, with some even being driven to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This article will help you understand the key disruptors manufacturers face in the near term, and provide practical tips for surviving (or even thriving) in the face of what Foley\u2019s automotive attorneys see coming down the road.\n\n1.  More automotive suppliers will suffer financial distress, but these will create possible opportunities for growth through acquisition.\n\nLenders who previously provided extensions of credit and forbearance on defaults are increasingly asserting their rights and remedies in the case of new or ongoing defaults by financially distressed automotive suppliers. Variable interest rate facilities have become more burdensome, and it is significantly more difficult for companies to refinance their way out of a loan maturity or cash flow problem. In addition, due to the various financial pressures they face, the automotive industry is experiencing an uptick in suppliers that are considering or have decided to liquidate. Meanwhile, the OEMs project increased sales of vehicles to catch up with pent up demand, and thus production capacity in many parts of the automotive supply chain continues to be highly sought after. \n\nThe cash flow, credit and decreased profitability issues that borrower auto supplier companies face may result in opportunities to purchase them (or their lenders\u2019 debt) at depressed valuations. While these deals may appear to be hard to come by, shrewd investors will be well served by considering both out-of-court and bankruptcy acquisitions of the distressed companies under pressure due to the current environment.  Legal strategies and tactics exist to structure and execute these transactions to reduce risks that may otherwise exist for both the seller (and its management) and the buyer.  Below is an overview of the fundamental strategies of effecting acquisitions outside of a court process, and in bankruptcy, with some key pros and cons.\n\nOut-of-Court Acquisition\n\nOften structured like a normal asset deal.\nDue diligence is even more critical to understand and, where possible, avoid and creatively address, potential liabilities.\nSpecify assumed liabilities and excluded liabilities.\nInclude indemnification and escrow where possible (but seller might not be able to perform under indemnification).\nNegotiations with creditor constituencies can reduce exposure.\nPros:\n\nFast, no court approvals required.\nLess expensive than a court process.\nBuyer can sometimes achieve more control\/certainty and purchase protections than in a court process.\nCan obtain traditional M&A protections (e.g., escrow, rep and warranty insurance, indemnity).\nTypically does not require an auction with competitive bidding.\nPotentially easy on customer\/supplier relationships (subject to contract terms).\nCons:\n\nCannot \u201ccherry pick\u201d contracts as easily as in bankruptcy.\nCannot force support from and bind non-consenting creditors (e.g., lenders).\nRisk of possible successor liability (vs \u201cfree and clear\u201d sale in bankruptcy).\nNeed shareholder consent.\nFraudulent transfer risk where seller does not receive reasonably equivalent\/fair value while insolvent, but consider these protections:\nArm\u2019s-length sale process with consents of key parties.\nValuation opinion.\nStructure through a friendly foreclosure\/Article 9 sale.\nBankruptcy 363 Sale\n\nBuyers often seek to avoid possible successor liability and other risks and require the sale to occur in a Chapter 11 to maximize buyer protections\/rights.\nSection 363 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to sell substantially all of its assets if supported by reasonable business judgment, free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances.\nSection 365 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to assume and assign, or reject, certain contracts and unexpired leases notwithstanding restrictions on assignment in such contracts.\nUpon a bankruptcy filing, the \u201cautomatic stay\u201d arises and protects the seller\u2019s assets from creditor collection efforts and contract terminations to enable a transaction to occur.\nPros:\n\nCourt approved sale is \u201cfree and clear\u201d of liabilities and balance sheet is clean.\nShareholder approval not required.\nEliminates fraudulent transfer risk.\nEnhanced successor liability protection.\nContracts can be \u201ccherry picked\u201d and bad ones left behind, regardless of consent.\nFast (sales can be approved within 30-60 days after a bankruptcy filing).\nClosing likely regardless of objecting creditors.\nBuyer can achieve \u201cstalking horse\u201d advantages: enhanced information, bid protections to protect itself and enhance purchase prospects (e.g., breakup fee and expense reimbursement, and bid increased by same), minimum bid increments and tight timeline for the sale.\nTactic: If buyer owns secured debt \u2013 it can credit bid for increased control.\nCons:\n\nSale will be to the \u201chighest and best bid\u201d; an auction is generally required and, notwithstanding stalking horse advantages, marketing process may yield an alternative winning bidder.\nSecured lender can credit bid its debt to set the floor.\nMore expensive than an out-of-court acquisition.\nUnsecured Creditor Committee appointed in Chapter 11 may delay sale and seek to extract more value.\nPurchase is \u201cas is\u201d \u2013 diminished escrow\/no indemnity.\n2.  An increase in financially distressed automotive suppliers will create threats to continuity of supply and threats to payment from customers. \n\nThe perfect storm of extraordinary factors creating conditions for financial distress throughout the automotive supply chain increases risk that some companies will breach, or threaten to breach, their contracts to supply goods or services, or to pay for the same.  Moreover, some suppliers will be disrupted by the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles.  Not all of these suppliers will have the financial strength to survive in this environment. And yet some of these suppliers may own technology that is valuable for more healthy, well-funded enterprises to opportunistically acquire or license for future use.\n\nFrom a financially challenged supplier perspective, there are possible opportunities for cost recovery.  While costs continue to rise, suppliers who seek cost recovery from their customers and who support their request with transparent and thorough data are more likely to achieve support from their customers. This can be in the form of increased prices, lump sum payments, resolution of commercial disputes and issues, or more profitable go-forward business. These negotiations can solidify the future of an otherwise financially distressed supplier, and actually strengthen long-term relationships within the supply chain to maximize value. Moreover, if the suppliers are in the electric and autonomous vehicle space, federal grants to support this newer portion of the industry are increasingly in play, such as those awarded by the Department of Energy in 2023 to support the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles in the U.S.\n\nBeyond cost recovery or grants for suppliers, critical strategies exist to mitigate supply chain risks and bolster the likelihood that distressed suppliers will continue to perform their obligations to your company and distressed customers will continue to pay your company for goods or services.

{"text":"Major Dental Insurer MCNA Dental Suffers Devastating Ransomware Attack\nJune 13, 2023\n\nMCNA Dental, a major US dental health insurance provider, was hit by a suspected ransomware attack in one of the largest health data breaches of 2023. The breach exposed over nine million Americans' personal data, raising concerns about data security and fraud. \n\nAtlanta-based MCNA Dental, known for serving government-sponsored programs for children and elders, revealed that a hacker had accessed their computer system between February 26 and March 7, 2023.\n\nThe attacker viewed and copied patients' names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, government-issued ID numbers, health insurance plans, Medicaid IDs, bills, and claim data. \n\nThe Maine attorney general informed 8.9 million MCNA Dental clients of the incident. Following another large data loss at PharMerica, this event highlights the healthcare sector's alarming vulnerability to personal data breaches. \n\nOn May 3, 2023, approximately two months after the cyberattack, MCNA Dental completed its investigation of the incident. However, the corporation has not provided any information about the breach, leaving affected parties unsure and concerned. \n\nWhen MCNA Dental refused to pay the $10 million ransom, LockBit ransomware claimed responsibility. LockBit boldly leaked 700GB of exfiltrated data on their dark web leak site. This example shows how ransomware groups intimidate and coerce enterprises into complying. \n\nSince September 2019, the Russian-linked ransomware gang LockBit has been operating. They've attacked Royal Mail, Ion, and California's Department of Finance in recent months. \n\nThe arrest of one of the gang's leaders, Mikhail Vasiliev, a dual Russian-Canadian national, in Canada last November and the US indictment of a Russian accused of leading LockBit ransomware in March have revealed the global scope and sophistication of these cybercriminal operations. \n\nThe MCNA Dental incident highlights the essential need for healthcare cybersecurity. Identity theft, financial fraud, and other harmful exploitation result from massive data theft. \n\nTo reduce cyberattack risk, firms that handle sensitive personal data must invest in cutting-edge security technologies, undertake vulnerability assessments, and emphasize employee training. \n\nTo tackle escalating cybercrime, governments, and regulatory agencies must implement strict data protection legislation and encourage public-private partnerships. \n\nAs the repercussions of this hack unfold, organizations and individuals must be cautious and take the appropriate safeguards to protect sensitive data in an increasingly digital world with evolving cyber threats.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles (EVs) \u2013 full battery-electric vehicles \u2013 were sold in the U.S. in Q2, a record for any quarter and an increase of 48.4% from Q2 2022. Tesla, again, was the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., with more than 175,000 sold, an increase of 34.8% quarter over quarter. Sales growth at Tesla, and the EV segment overall, was aided by sizeable price cuts by some automakers (Tesla, really) and incentive levels well above the industry average. In June, the average price paid for an EV was down nearly 20% year over year. EV share of the U.S. market in Q2 was 7.2%, up from 5.7% a year ago and down from the high in Q1 of an upwardly revised 7.3%.\n\nTesla is the No. 1 seller of luxury vehicles in the U.S., but its share of EV sales continues to fizzle. In Q2, Tesla\u2019s share fell below 60% for the first time, but the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S. \u2013 Chevrolet \u2013 is a distant second. Tesla outsold Chevrolet 10 to 1 in Q2. Ford and Hyundai are third and fourth behind Chevrolet. Newcomer Rivian had a good quarter, with more than 20,000 units sold. Tesla\u2019s success, in many ways, is the Model Y, the leading EV in America. One of every three EVs sold last quarter was a Tesla Model Y. Add in the similar-sized Model 3, and those two products are half the electric vehicle business. The once-leading Model S is no longer the best-selling high-end EV. Sales last quarter were estimated at 5,257, down more than 40% year over year and well behind the newcomer: BMW i4 EV sedan, with 6,777 sales in Q2, the new boss when it comes to super-lux EV sedans.\n\nEV sales growth and filling the gaps in infrastructure to support EV mobility continue to be the industry\u2019s leading story. Cox Automotive expects the country to welcome 1 million new EVs to its roads in 2023, which will fuel the budding used EV market further. Sparked in part by government incentives, new battery production facilities are cropping up around the country, and factories are being retooled and rethought to support EV production. This fall, the United Auto Workers are negotiating their labor contracts with many automakers, and one topic is front and center: EVs. Even vehicle transportation and logistics \u2013 the trucking of EVs \u2013 is being redesigned in some part, as the current crop of EVs is heavier and harder to move than their ICE brethren.\n\nAnd EV sales keep growing.\n\nIn a recent Cox Automotive survey, more than 50% of shoppers were interested in adding an EV to their stable. Being interested is easy, of course, but far fewer people actually buy. And in the same survey, 53% of consumers agreed that EVs will eventually replace traditional ICE-powered vehicles. Dealers were more cautious, with only 31% agreeing on an all-EV future. Dealers have a front-row seat to the many challenges ahead. And many dealers, recently, have been watching EV inventory building.\n\nIn late June 2023, the days\u2019 supply of EVs was over 100, whereas industry-wide inventory levels were closer to 53 days. When it comes to EV sales, the market is likely heading into its Trough of Disillusionment (hat tip to the Gartner Hype Cycle), where collaboration across many parties will be necessary to push through. Building EVs is one thing, and many in the industry are proving excellent at that skill. Selling EVs is something different altogether. Yes, EV sales records will continue to be set, and EV growth will continue to outpace overall industry growth, but the days of 75% year-over-year growth are in the rearview mirror. The hard-growth days are ahead.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Famous for its geyser valley, rivers, bears, volcanos and exceptional biodiversity, the \u2018pristine\u2019 Kamchatka peninsula in Russia\u2019s Far East has been the scene of massive die-off of benthic marine organisms.\n\nIn mid-September, the seawater changed its colour and took on an unpleasant smell. People reported health effects. Dead sea animals washed ashore, leaving carcasses along many of the beaches. \n\nLocals, especially surfers, were the first to post about the environmental disaster on social media. They said that after surfing they were experiencing sore throat, eye pain, and itching skin from being in contact with the water. Some of them reported nausea and vomiting. At Greenpeace Russia, we listened to their stories and formed a team to investigate.\n\nThe unique nature of Kamchatka is under threat\nAccording to local scientists, the event has killed 95% of marine life on the surrounding seabed. The scale and cause of the disaster is still unknown, but we do know that a large part of the coastal area around the Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO world heritage site has been impacted. Results of water analyses taken by the Russian authorities and Greenpeace Russia gave little clue as to the cause. The die-off could have been caused both by natural events or as a result of human activity.\n\nEnvironmental Disaster in Kamchatka. \u00a9 RFE_RL\nKamchatka, near the Khalaktyr beach. Hundreds of dead sea animals washed ashore.\n\u00a9 RFE_RL\nThe Greenpeace Russia team arrived in Kamchatka on the 4th of October to bear witness to this environmental disaster. Researchers took samples of seawater, soil and dead animals found on the central city beach of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and sent them to Moscow to be analysed. Campaigners are also exploring the southern part of the peninsula from a ship, together with scientists and researchers from Kamchatka\u2019s Kronotsky Nature Reserve. Divers on the ship are set to examine the ocean floor to the north and south of Kamchatka. An underwater drone with a high-definition camera has been used. Underwater photography and sample collection here may help to reveal the extent of this ecological disaster in the Pacific Ocean and perhaps give some clues as to what caused it.\n\nInvestigation and transparency now\nGiven the fact that the cause of this die-off has not, as yet, been established, Greenpeace Russia is demanding an independent, transparent investigation into the cause and the scale of this highly damaging event. Meanwhile, Greenpeace Russia teams in Kamchatka, Moscow and St.Petersburg are consulting a range of experts to try to understand what might have happened. Initial analysis of satellite images from September indicate that the soil around the rivers that flow into the ocean may have become eroded. But, as long as the cause remains  unknown, many hypotheses remain on the table. These range from natural causes such as toxic phytoplankton growth, seismic or volcanic activity, to human activities such as toxic waste dumping, a fuel spill or tanker accident, or military activity. But so far the search for the cause must continue. \n\nRussia needs a green and just transition\nInvestigating the ecological disaster in Kamchatka has shown that the region has a huge number of unresolved environmental problems. Landfills with hazardous waste, disposal sites, burial sites. If not immediately, then in the future these may cause new problems. Dangerous landfills in Kamchatka and whole Russia should be mapped, checked and reclaimed. \n\nWhatever the cause of the Kamchatka disaster, one thing for sure is that, to protect people and nature from environmental disasters, Russia needs to shift away from an economic model based on extraction and exploitation. Pollution impacts are spiralling out of control. Earlier this year, in the Russian Arctic, we saw one of the worst environmental disasters in the country\u2019s history. A plant operated by Nornickel \u2014 whose factories in the area have made the city of Norilsk one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth \u2014 spewed thousands of tonnes of oil into land and water in Taimyr, Siberia, turning the Ambarnaya River red. As with so many environmental and human wrongs, the damage landed heaviest on Indigenous and ethnic minority groups. \n\nEven if Kamchatka was a natural event, ecological disasters like those that have happened in Norilsk and elsewhere in the Russian Arctic underline the need for green and just transition. Russia needs to move away from polluting industries that are wrecking lives and costing the Earth, and towards renewable energy and jobs that sustain households and workers and protect the environment. This must be reflected in government policies. \n\nGreenpeace Russia is urging the government to support people on the frontlines of environmental crises, to tighten environmental policy to prevent future disasters, and to adopt a long-term program for green transformation of the economy. A shift towards a green economy would not only reduce environment and climate impacts but also help to address the ongoing social, health and economic crisis. We need a Green Recovery Plan for Russia and we need it now.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"STOCKHOLM, April 26 (Reuters) - Swedish defence equipment maker Saab's (SAABb.ST) Q1 results beat forecasts on Wednesday as countries continued to stock up on surveillance gear and weapons because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nOrder intake at the company that makes a range of military and civilian hardware doubled to 17.02 billion crowns ($1.66 billion) from 8.1 billion, while its order backlog increased to 132.66 billion crowns from 128 billion crowns.\n\nSaab, which competes with U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), France's Dassault and Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L), has seen strong demand for its products over the past year as the war raised geopolitical tensions, leading many nations to ramp up military spending.\n\nThe company's biggest customers include the Swedish government, as well as France, the United Kingdom and Germany. It also received orders from Lithuania and Finland in the first quarter.\n\nChief executive Micael Johansson said countries are increasing stocks to improve their own resilience, as well as to support Ukraine, which had translated into a strong order intake.\n\nThe first quarter was boosted by one order worth 8 billion crowns from the government of a Western country for a Carl-Gustaf multi-purpose shoulder launched weapon and an RBS 70 NG short-range air defence system.\n\nDemand has been particularly strong in the surveillance and dynamics businesses, which include sensors, deterrents, support weapons and missiles, he said.\n\n\"It's mainly Europe and the U.S. we see taking that responsibility,\" Johansson said, adding that European countries also have depleted stocks that need to be replenished.\n\n\"I think this will be quite long term because we are still in the beginning of this growth on creating a higher capability level, including Sweden...So we need to support that by increasing our capacities along with the market,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts at Citi said it was a strong start to the year for Saab, with sales, operating profit and orders beating consensus.\n\nShares in Saab were up around 4.5% as the market opened, but reversed course later and at 1027 were flat.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Johansson said Saab had secured a large volume of materials needed to make its products such as explosives, gunpowder, semiconductors, and raw materials for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe added, however, that as a result of the high demand the need to have a strong and more reliable supply chain had increased and further investment was needed to ensure security of supply.\n\nOperating profit for the maker of the Gripen fighter jet was 928 million Swedish crowns in the quarter, compared with 654 million crowns a year earlier.\n\nSaab maintained that it expected organic sales growth in 2023 to be around 15%, but that growth in the remaining quarters of the year was likely to slow from the strong first quarter.\n\n","labels":["financial_success"]}
{"text":"RIYADH: At the end of July, a $2.6 billion deal with Brazil\u2019s biggest miner, Vale SA, gave Saudi Arabia a 10 percent interest in mines from Canada to Indonesia that produce copper, nickel and other industrial metals \u2014 all critical materials needed to help the world decarbonize. \n\nThe deal set the stage for a landmark shift in the metal and mining investment landscape and positions the Kingdom as a pivotal global player.\n\nDeals like the one with Vale SA are being staged at a time when governments across the world are questioning who controls the commodities needed to hit decarbonization targets and sustain the world\u2019s economy during intense climate change and volatile markets. \n\nAnother factor is China, which has long been the world\u2019s dominant mining country based on mineral production value, reporting over $217 billion in metallic mineral and coal production value, according to Statistica. Yet as geopolitical factors shift, the mining industry is also looking to other players.\n\n\u201cMining is going to be the third most important industry in the Kingdom,\u201d Saudi businessman Amr Khashoggi, who has been manufacturing gypsum for over 42 years, told Arab News.\n\n\u201cThere is a critical shortage of minerals that the world needs,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey go into phones, weaponry, electric cars and many different things.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia now wants to develop its mining industry and it is doing so through cooperation with various countries that are now working with the Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe development of the Kingdom\u2019s mining industry is one of the cornerstones of the Vision 2030 agenda towards economic growth, diversification and social transformation. \n\nSaudi Arabia is now seeking to take minority stakes in global mining assets that will over time allow it access to key supplies of strategic minerals.\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom has begun to explore the potential of its mineral wealth, currently estimated at $1.3 to $1.5 trillion in value,\u201d Ali Alireza, managing director of Haji Husein Alireza & Co. told Arab News. \u201cThis is an important key towards reducing the country\u2019s high dependence on oil and fossil fuels. \n\n\u201cThe Kingdom covers nearly 2 million sq. km and is one of the world\u2019s top 15 countries by area, with a relatively little developed mining industry. The potential is huge.\u201d\n\nTo kickstart this process, Alireza explains, Saudi Arabia passed a law in June 2020 to attract foreign investors into the Kingdom\u2019s mining business. The law, which came into effect in January 2021, aids the country in exploring mineral resources worth around $1.3 trillion, according to Invest Saudi.\n\nThis is all part of a campaign to attract nearly $200 billion in investments in mining by 2030.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources, the Kingdom possesses more than 20 different types of minerals, including gold, copper, iron, granite and marble. \n\nIn March this year, the ministry announced indicative timelines for the bidding cycles of five new mineral exploration opportunities that were showcased at the Future Minerals Forum 2023 in January in Riyadh. \n\nThis action underlines a strategic shift in the Kingdom\u2019s policy towards the discovery and extraction of minerals and metals that will aid the country\u2019s transition towards green energy.\n\n\u201cNew industries in a world trying to transition into a clean energy environment create new needs and opportunities in the mining sector,\u201d adds Alireza. \u201cIn this regard, Saudi mines are rich in such minerals as required, for instance, in battery transition in cars as well as other vital minerals for powering electricity generating turbines etc. Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest in the mining industry is not limited to within its shores, but complements it with international alliances such as that with Brasil\u2019s Vale SA and also the recent agreement with Japan to develop rare earth mining in Saudi Arabia and in other markets.\u201d\n\nThe development of the Kingdom\u2019s mining industry is contingent on foreign deals and investment. The Vale deal marks Saudi Arabia\u2019s first major foray into mining, and comes via Manara Minerals, a new venture between the Kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, known as Ma\u2019aden.\n\nKhashoggi, who participated in the second Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh in January and was subsequently appointed to the National Mining Council of Saudi Arabia, pointed out the Kingdom is investing in mining companies that are using very advanced technologies. \u201cTechnology is becoming an important tool for the mining industry because you can use it for mapping, for operating machinery remotely without having people self-operate machinery. Such technologies can also be used efficiently in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Forum this year featured some of the biggest names in mining, including the CEO of the world\u2019s largest mining company, BHP\u2019s Mike Henry.\n\nAlso present was Dominic Barton, chairman of the Anglo-Australian multinational company Rio Tinto \u2013 the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation. \n\nThe attendance of such figures showed the Kingdom\u2019s growing place in the world\u2019s mining industry.\n\nHowever, as Khashoggi stressed: \u201cThe mining industry in Saudi Arabia is still in its infancy.\u201d\n\nTo move ahead, the Kingdom needs to keep investing in its own mining operations, secure more foreign investment, and make deals internationally.\n\nAlireza agrees, noting that while Saudi Arabia has been developing its own oil and gas industry through Saudi Aramco thanks to its own local knowledge, \u201cthe development of its mining industry is undertaken by inviting the investment and participation of world leaders in the mining sector to quickly build its own knowledge base and local Saudi expertise in this field.\u201d \n\nThe Kingdom, as it has realized, cannot grow alone, and its economic development and rise in this crucial world industry is contingent upon international collaboration.\n\n","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Here\u2019s an important and arguably unappreciated ingredient in the glue that holds society together: Google makes it moderately difficult to learn how to commit an act of terrorism. The first several pages of results for a Google search on how to build a bomb, or how to commit a murder, or how to unleash a biological or chemical weapon, won\u2019t actually tell you much about how to do it.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible to learn these things off the internet. People have successfully built working bombs from publicly available information. Scientists have warned others against publishing the blueprints for deadly viruses because of similar fears. But while the information is surely out there on the internet, it\u2019s not straightforward to learn how to kill lots of people, thanks to a concerted effort by Google and other search engines.\n\nHow many lives does that save? That\u2019s a hard question to answer. It\u2019s not as if we could responsibly run a controlled experiment where sometimes instructions about how to commit great atrocities are easy to look up and sometimes they aren\u2019t.\n\nBut it turns out we might be irresponsibly running an uncontrolled experiment in just that, thanks to rapid advances in large language models (LLMs).\n\nSecurity through obscurity\nWhen first released, AI systems like ChatGPT were generally willing to give detailed, correct instructions about how to carry out a biological weapons attack or build a bomb. Over time, Open AI has corrected this tendency, for the most part. But a class exercise at MIT, written up in a preprint paper earlier this month and covered last week in Science, found that it was easy for groups of undergraduates without relevant background in biology to get detailed suggestions for biological weaponry out of AI systems.\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Global oil companies have rebounded since the pandemic to post their highest ever profits since people started using petroleum.\n\nChevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell all reported record profits in 2022 \u2014 a year in which Russia's war on Ukraine collided with the post-pandemic economic recovery to drive oil prices to their highest levels in history. \n\nTogether, the four companies saw $1 trillion in sales last year, a sum greater than the total economic output of Colombia, South Africa or Switzerland. TotalEnergies and BP are set to report their 2022 financial results next week. \n\nThe record profits come after a year of skyrocketing gas prices. After slumping hard in 2020, global consumption of oil and gasoline bounced back far slower than production, putting pressure on gas prices. Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago further shrank the world's oil supplies, bringing the average price of gas in the U.S. above $5 a gallon in the spring and summer.\n\n\nShell on Thursday reported a nearly $40 billion profit for last year. That's more than double the prior year's results and the most money Shell has ever made in its 115 years of existence. Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the U.S., posted record earnings of $36.5 billion last year, while refiner ConocoPhillips doubled its profits to $18.7 billion, the highest in the 10 years since it spun off its refining business.\n\n\nExxon, the largest U.S. oil producer, this week reported an epic $55 billion in profits for 2022. The oil giant's bottom line \"clearly benefited from a favorable market,\" CEO Darren Woods told investors. He also touted Exxon's investments before and during the pandemic, which allowed it to increase production as demand was ramping up. \n\n\"We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom,\" Woods said. \n\nThe windfall makes Exxon the third-most-profitable company of 2022, behind only Apple and Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn addition to high prices for crude oil, elevated natural-gas prices and high margins in the refining business also pushed up oil company profit, said Peter McNally, industrial and energy analyst at Third Bridge.\n\n\n\"Windfall\" profits\nThe White House and environmentalists have condemned oil companies' ballooning profits. The White House has criticized fossil-fuel companies for not increasing production to help bring down gas prices, and last year floated a tax on oil and gas profits. \n\nA White House spokesperson called Exxon's record profit \"outrageous\" in a statement to the BBC. The spokesperson, Abdullah Hasan, also blasted Chevron's announcement that it would spend $75 billion on buying back stock from investors.\n\n\"Companies clearly have everything they need \u2014 record profits and thousands of approved permits \u2014 to increase production. The only thing getting in the way is their own decision to keep plowing windfall profits into the pockets of executives,\" Hasan tweeted.\n\n\"A windfall tax on oil and gas profits is needed more than ever, to free up money that's desperately needed to help those struggling with the cost of energy, and as economies around the world face recession,\" Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner with Global Witness, told the Associated Press.\n\nSome jurisdictions, including the European Union and the U.K., have imposed such taxes on surplus energy-company profits, putting the proceeds toward covering citizens' skyrocketing energy costs. In December, Exxon sued to stop the EU's tax.\n\n\"We looked at what happened in the EU and said it both is not legal and it's the opposite of what is needed,\" Woods said Tuesday, calling the tax \"a penalty on the broad energy sector.\"\n\nDramatic turnaround\nOil companies have seen a remarkable turnaround from 2020, a year when travel ground to a halt, demand for fuel evaporated, dozens of oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy protection, and thousands of industry workers were laid off. Exxon lost $22 billion that year \u2014 the first year in decades that it had lost money.\n\n\nIn addition to oil-extracting operations that were taken offline in 2020, refining capacity also fell, contributing to higher gas prices and refinery profit margins.\n\n\"The refining business, particularly in the U.S., soared to record levels,\" McNally, the Third Bridge analyst, said. \"The price of crude oil went up but the prices of refined products like gasoline and diesel went up even more. The largest U.S. independent refiner, Marathon Petroleum, delivered record profits, but ExxonMobil and Chevron also compete in refining.\"","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"Little-known but powerful, Perenco styles itself as Europe\u2019s leading independent oil and gas group. It operates in 14 countries, including the largest onshore European oil farm, in England, and several gas rigs in the North Sea. \n\nThe multinational\u2019s success has benefited its owners above all: the Perrodo family, France\u2019s 15th wealthiest with homes in London\u2019s most exclusive neighbourhoods. The billionaires, who gave their name to their company (Perrodo Energy Company), feathered their nest far from media spotlight and public scrutiny. \n\nOne of the reasons behind their discreet ascent is that Perenco is not listed on the stock market. As a result, the group is free from transparency rules that affect its main competitors. And with fewer than 10,000 employees worldwide, it is not subject to French laws requiring companies to list the risks associated with their activities abroad.\nAll this makes attempts to scrutinise the company\u2019s operations particularly difficult. Yet, Perenco\u2019s business is worth looking into: it specialises in buying up mature assets that other oil majors are trying to get rid of due to aging facilities and ebbing reserves. \n\nPerenco has been embroiled in various environmental and human rights scandals in several countries where it is present. Accused of funding paramilitary groups in Colombia and linked to the displacement of indigenous communities in Guatemala, the firm has also faced a litany of land pollution and water contamination allegation across Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn its race to become Europe\u2019s leading private oil company, Perenco has relied on radical methods, sometimes cutting corners at the expense of the environment. \n\n\u201cIt is certain that compared to the standards of Total or big American companies, Perenco are not on the same level,\u201d  a former Perenco executive in Africa told IE and Disclose. The group, he added, questions environmental norms \u201cthat they consider incompatible with their model.\u201d\n\nThis model has led to scores of alleged incidents at Perenco sites over the years. Dumping of toxic sludge, oil leaks due to aging facilities and air pollution are common occurrences in countries where Perenco has subsidiaries, according to reports by NGOs, authorities and journalists.\n\n\nIn Gabon, 50,000 cubic metres of oil leaked from some of the group\u2019s tanks last April. In the town of Muanda, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the company is burning gas day and night near homes, crops and drinking water sources. On the other side of the Atlantic, in Peru, the multinational has taken the government to court in an attempt to block the creation of a nature reserve in its operating area.\n\nWhen questioned by IE and Disclose, the company said: \u201cPerenco acts as a responsible partner. In each country where it operates, Perenco is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees and communities.\u201d \n\nHowever, the group \u201crecognises that incidents relating to our activities have occurred in the past\u201d, but declined to comment on the ongoing legal process in Gabon. A spokesperson added that a significant investment had been made in DRC to reduce flaring, and that the company was working closely with local communities in Peru.\n\nHubert the \u201cconqueror\u201d\nPerenco\u2019s origins can be traced back to tax havens. In 1967, Hubert Perrodo, the group\u2019s founder, who hails from a fisherman\u2019s family on the west coast of France, was working for an American oil tycoon in the Bahamas. \u201cIf you want to make a fortune, kid, you have to get into oil!\u201d his then boss is said to have told him. \n\nIn 1971, Perrodo moved to Singapore. The \u201cconqueror\u201d, as he is described on Perenco\u2019s website, worked in the fossil fuel industry and met his wife, with whom he had three children. In the 1970s, he created a shipping company and set up a drilling business, before establishing Perenco in 1992. Following Perrodo\u2019s death in a mountaineering accident in 2006, his eldest son, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, took the reins of the family empire. A car racing enthusiast, he has followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to expand the business, which he owns with his siblings and mother. Today, in addition to their oil company, the Perrodos own a number of famous French wine estates and, more surprisingly, are the majority owners of Konbini, a popular online news outlet. \n\nSecret financial architecture \nIf Perenco\u2019s motto proudly states that \u201coil remains an adventure\u201d, the Perrodos have become masters of a completely different trade: the creation of opaque corporate structures. While Perenco\u2019s headquarters are located in affluent parts of London and Paris, the group is made of a myriad of companies registered in tax havens. \n\nIn the Bahamas alone, the multinational was relying on 62 holdings as of 2016. IE\u2019s analysis of oil contracts and public registries around the world shows that these holdings have been used to set up subsidiaries in countries where Perenco has activities, while keeping ownership and cash flows shrouded in secrecy. \n\nTo set up this complex financial scheme, the Perrodos were helped by a handful of trusted men. Among them is the father of France\u2019s energy transition minister, Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher. By Hubert Perrodo\u2019s side from the start, Jean-Michel Runacher has remained one of the group\u2019s key figures to this day. Previously chief financial officer, CEO and administrator, he\u2019s still at the helm of some of the group\u2019s companies. \n\n\nCredit: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Barande \/\u00c9cole polytechnique Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay\/Creative Commons\nAccording to IE and Disclose\u2019s investigation, part of the wealth he amassed during his career was discreetly passed on to the minor children of Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher.

{"text":"Crypto investors got a rude awakening in August. After a period of relatively calm markets, major cryptocurrencies saw a significant selloff. Bitcoin lost more than 10% of its value within the span of a few days. \n\nAmong the factors being blamed for the most recent decline is the decision by Elon Musk's Space X to sell off a big chunk of its Bitcoin holdings \n[1]\n. But given its track record, Bitcoin's volatility will likely continue, and investors should buckle up. \n\nThough the factors driving each crypto crash are different, it can be helpful to remember a few established investing principles, like choosing how much of your overall portfolio should be invested in crypto and remembering why you invested in the first place.\n\nThe latest market shock is another jarring bump in the road for cryptocurrency, which has seen its value plummet since the highs of 2021. Here's a rundown of a few of the factors that have been driving uncertainty and volatility so far this year.\n\nWhat can cause a crypto crash?\nCrypto prices can be dramatically affected by major events, such as exchanges or coins crashing. They can also sink with higher interest rates, rising inflation and other macroeconomic factors that can affect how confident people feel investing their money in risky alternative assets.\n\nRegulatory factors and financial enforcement actions like those carried out by the SEC can also affect the market.\n\nAnd when prices fall rapidly, that can compound the pressure on the market by forcing some investors to free up cash so they can meet other obligations.\n\nIn the case of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 , the impact to the market was enormous. The FTX crash didn't just affect FTX, but also cryptocurrencies FTX heavily invested in (such as Solana) and firms FTX did business with. \n\nThe crypto exchange BlockFi, which received a line of credit from FTX.US and was set to be acquired by the company later in the year, froze withdrawals before filing for bankruptcy itself a few weeks after FTX did.\n\nHas crypto crashed before? \nYes, multiple times. For example, Bitcoin recorded a previous record high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, but by December 2018 was trading below $3,500. It reached an all-time high of about $69,000 in November 2021 and in the year since dropped by more than 75%.\n\nI\u2019m worried about keeping my crypto with an exchange. What should I do?\nConsider moving your digital assets to a separate crypto wallet. Most exchanges allow you to transfer assets to these wallets, which can be online (on a separate platform) or offline (on a thumb drive with added security features).\n\nWhat are the risks of buying crypto?\nWhen crypto is crashing, someone who's been intrigued from the sideline might think this is the time to get in and \"buy low.\" But while prices can recover \u2014 and have done so in the past \u2014 the recovery could take months or years.\n\nConditions might also get worse before they get better. Following a major crash, prices could also continue to go down for some time, especially if the event causes financial troubles for other exchanges or currencies.\n\nUnlike traditional financial exchanges, crypto markets don't have circuit breakers, which automatically pause trading when prices dive too quickly. This means prices could plunge much faster than traditional investments.\n\nAnother distinction between crypto and securities such as stocks is that crypto trades around the clock. If you're worried about swings in value, you might find it hard to sleep. \n\nThere's also a chance any given cryptocurrency could go to zero, or close to zero, following a massive sell-off. Such was the case with Terra and Luna.\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Emmanuel Macron, accompanied by top French business executives, concluded his trip to China on Friday with a visit to the southern city of Canton, where he met with more Chinese investors. With trade talks on the agenda, several deals between companies from both countries have already been sealed during the French president\u2019s first visit to China since the Covid-19 pandemic. A French economist shares with FRANCE 24 her insight on the concerns surrounding trade ties between Paris and Beijing.  \n\nBusiness is in the air as Airbus announced on Friday that it would deliver 50 helicopters to GDAT, one of China's largest helicopter lessors. The announcement was made only a day after Airbus pledged to double production in China by setting up a second assembly line at its Tianjin plant. Meanwhile, French national electricity company \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF) renewed its contract with Chinese energy giant China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN). Cosmetics leader L\u2019Or\u00e9al sealed a deal with e-commerce platform Alibaba on \u2018sustainable consumption\u2019 while water and waste management company Suez clinched a desalination contract with China\u2019s Wanhua chemical.  \n\nThis series of freshly inked business deals, highlighted by Macron\u2019s trip to China, seems to show France\u2019s positive outlook on business in China. FRANCE 24 talked to Mary-Fran\u00e7oise Renard, an economics professor at the University of Clermont Auvergne and director of the Institute of Research on China\u2019s Economy, to shed light on current Sino-Franco trade relations.  \n\nFRANCE 24: What kind of signals do these business deals send? Do they represent a broadening of current trade relations between Paris and Beijing?   \nMary-Fran\u00e7oise Renard: It\u2019s a good sign, of course! It means that businesses are going smoothly for French companies in China, so it\u2019s good news. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily represent significant changes to current trade relations between France and China as the recently sealed deals are prepared a long time in advance. Despite this being President Macron\u2019s first visit since 2019 to China, commercial transactions between the two nations have never ceased during this period. We did, indeed, witness throughout the past three years a slowing down due to constraints imposed by the pandemic, during which China shut down its borders. But it\u2019s part of the global trend, economic activities across countries decreased in the same period. We\u2019re really just picking up where we left it before Covid.  \n\nDespite a generally positive outlook, several industry players have cited concerns over continuing to conduct business in China and advocate for a more cautious approach. Do you share such concerns?   \nThe concerns [of French businesses trading with China] are well grounded. There is a greater risk due to the current geopolitical climate as well as increasing interventions from the Chinese Communist Party. Government intervention has already been heavily present in China, but it has become much more prominent [China\u2019s government has imposed party units in private companies since 1993, a policy that has expanded under Xi Jinping]. Companies are left with little wiggle room, which inevitably leads to a certain cautiousness, even wariness that was much less noticeable in the past.  \n\nDoes that mean that only multinationals and large corporations can afford to take the risk of trading with China?  \nI would like to point out a particularity in France\u2019s industrial fabric, which is far from being new: France has a lot of large companies and a lot of small companies. What we don\u2019t have are medium-sized companies, contrary to Germany, for example. And it\u2019s much riskier for a small company to export goods, especially to China. The company would need to hire export managers with good knowledge of China\u2019s market and know-how, which can be very costly. It\u2019s much easier for large corporations, which already have the necessary resources at hand and can, eventually, afford to fail. Unfortunately, due to structural reasons and the current economic conjuncture, France does not have medium-sized companies that can also afford to take on such a risk.  \n\nAccording to statistics published by French customs, France\u2019s trade deficit vis-\u00e0-vis China continued to widen to \u20ac39.6 billion in 2021, a now decades-long trend. Is there any potential improvement in sight?   \nFrance\u2019s trade deficit is essentially due to the structure of the country\u2019s foreign trade. We export various services to China which award us with surpluses (\u20ac6.1 billion in 2021), but we import a lot more goods (\u20ac77.7 billion in 2021) which ultimately leads to a deficit in our trade balance with China. And the widening of our trade deficit is partly the result of recovering household consumption in France as well as growing industrial output, which drove the demand of imported materials. Structurally speaking, France suffers from a lack of competitiveness on goods for household consumption, such as electronics, clothing and other daily-use products. The deficit is here to stay, and [it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing] if we hope to maintain the current level of household consumption.  \n\nThe World Trade Organization on Wednesday published a report forecasting a global decrease in trade growth to 1.7% for this year. How much would this impact trade between Paris and Beijing?  \nOf course, we cannot exclude extraordinary events, or in any case, events that occur earlier than predicted such as the Ukraine war. But in the current context of things, it is very likely that we will witness a slowing down of business transactions between France and China due to high inflation, growing geopolitical tensions and protectionist policies set in place by the US.\n\nPart of the US\u2019s protectionist policies can be found in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed last August that openly targets China.  Do you think this divide might bring Europe and China closer?  \nIt\u2019s very hard to predict. The US\u2019s policies would probably not directly alter Europe\u2019s economic strategies towards China. The latter would most certainly attempt to profit and seduce Europe, as the US\u2019s IRA alienates even its European partners. However, Europe pursues a strategy that is more centred on diversifying risks than decoupling [from the US]. For now, Europe continues to develop its relations with China independently through trade and dialogue.  ","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Like digitization for the past few decades, decarbonization is a \u201cmegatrend\u201d for the global financial markets, Rama Variankaval, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s Center for Carbon Transition, told CNBC.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re an energy client, or a consumer products client, or a retail client, there is something about this megatrend that is going to impact your business model, your business,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\nRama Variankaval, global head of the center for carbon transition for JP Morgan Securities LLC, speaks during the Aspen Ideas: Climate conference in Miami Beach, Florida, US, on Thursday, March, 9, 2023. Aspen Ideas: Climate is a solutions-focused event designed for the public to interact with and learn from climate leaders whose ideas and actions are critical to address our collective future.\nRama Variankaval, global head of the center for carbon transition for JP Morgan Securities LLC, speaks during the Aspen Ideas: Climate conference in Miami Beach, Florida, US, on Thursday, March, 9, 2023. Aspen Ideas: Climate is a solutions-focused event designed for the public to interact with and learn from climate leaders whose ideas and actions are critical to address our collective future.\n\nRama Variankaval is in his 20th year at JPMorgan Chase\n and at the end of 2020, he expanded his role in the corporate finance advisory arm of the bank to help spearhead the bank\u2019s strategy on decarbonization, which refers to reducing or eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from a system or process.\n\nHe calls decarbonization a \u201cmegatrend\u201d in global financial markets, much like digitization has been for the last few decades.\n\n\u201cAt any point in time, there are certain megatrends that impact more than just a narrow part of the economy,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC in a video interview earlier in August. In his career at JPMorgan, Variankaval\u2019s mission has been to identify and have a viewpoint on what those megatrends are and then to \u201cdirect our energies, our efforts, our balance sheets, to align with those megatrends.\u201d\n\nHe believes decarbonization makes the grade because global regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will touch every business in every part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re an energy client, or a consumer products client, or a retail client, there is something about this megatrend that is going to impact your business model, your business,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nJPMorgan is looking be a big lender in the sector. The bank has said it aims in the coming decade to finance more than $2.5 trillion in projects that advance climate and sustainable development goals.\n\nMegatrend started around 2020\nThe topic of ESG \u2014 environmental, social, and corporate governance \u2014 investing started coming up in 2018 \u201cquite frequently,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC. That focus on an investing strategy incorporating nonfinancial measures of responsibilities proved to be a harbinger of the increasingly intense focus on climate.\n\nClimate change has been an issue for much longer than decarbonization has been a global financial megatrend, but a number of factors coincided to make decarbonization a business imperative.\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement, adopted by 196 parties at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, was \u201ca fairly massive catalyst,\u201d Variankaval said.\n\nBy 2020, large asset owners, like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, started to prioritize decarbonization \u201cwith higher intensity,\u201d Variankaval noted.\n\nAs the largest asset owners started to prioritize decarbonization, their influence trickled down and influenced the behavior of other financial gatekeepers. Asset managers started asking the companies where they were making investments to start focusing resources and operations on decarbonization. For publicly traded companies, that pressure came in the form of proxy votes on issues relating to decarbonization.\n\nIn 2020, JPMorgan formally announced its Center for Carbon Transition, a group responsible for designing and implementing the bank\u2019s strategy around climate and sustainability as it pertains to its client-facing businesses, and to also engage with those companies about that strategy \u201cbecause we felt everyone was thinking about these topics,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s landmark climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed in August 2022, further established the megatrend, accelerating the flow of capital into decarbonization and low-carbon technologies like solar, wind, green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, carbon capture, and other areas.\n\nThe IRA lowered the net cost of capital for these decarbonization technology companies by as much as 5%, according to Variankaval, because it made it cheaper for decarbonization companies to put together their capital stack, or financing for deals. Deals that were typically done with a combination of debt and equity got a third source of capital added to the mix: tax credits and the associated tax equity.\n\nThe IRA happened just as the broader economy simultaneously slowed as interest rates climbed to combat rising inflation. Those higher rates in the broader economy counteracted against some of the incentives of the IRA, but even with that backdrop the legislation has turbocharged the sector. By JPMorgan\u2019s count, more than $100 billion worth of investments have been announced in just the last year with a direct link to the IRA, says Variankaval.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s about $50 billion a year going into climate tech companies via private funding and venture capital funding pathways, Variankaval said.\n\n\u201cWe see massive amounts of capital formation happening around the climate theme, or around the decarbonization theme, and we absolutely want to be the bank that is a leader in helping our clients navigate that, whether they are small clients or big clients,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nWhile the IRA is specific to the United States, companies and governments are reevaluating their own industrial policies around the globe to focus more on resiliency.\n\n\u201cWe went, I think, a period of 15, 20, 30 years, where efficiency was the No. 1 guiding principle of how you organize yourself,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC. The thinking was \u201clet\u2019s find the cheapest place to do every part of our supply chain, and stitch it all together.\u201d\n\nBut now, the resiliency of a company\u2019s supply chain is being given as much priority as efficiency. And sustainability is a keystone of resiliency.\n\nIn addition to a sharpening global focus on decarbonization, the Covid-19 pandemic shone a spotlight on the importance of supply chains, their vulnerability and the importance of focusing on resiliency in supply chain management.\n\n\u201cAll of these are coming together in a way to, I think, be perhaps the largest change in how capital flows that at least I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to be picking winners and losers\nIn addition to helping its clients adapt to a decarbonizing economy, JPMorgan also sees opportunity in being the go-to bank for the burgeoning and potentially high-growth sector of climate tech companies.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely want to be there with them at the ground level, and then have these companies grow with us. We want to be the bank of their choice,\u201d Variankaval said.\n\nRight now, though, it\u2019s too soon to name the climate tech companies that will be the winners or losers.\n\n\u201cIn a more traditional way of bringing about changes, a lot of research gets done in academic labs and government labs, and then people take it out and test it out in the commercial setting, and figure out what works, what doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a multi-decade-long process,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nIt took two decades for the internet to go from invention to wide business adoption, and in this case \u201cwe don\u2019t have the luxury of time when it comes to climate tech to go through the long-run process,\u201d Variankaval said.\n\nIn some segments of climate tech, there are debates about which solutions are better than others that take on a near-religious fervor. The JPMorgan exec says that\u2019s not particularly helpful.\n\n\u201cWe have to deploy capital across all likely solutions, knowing that some may not really work as promised and the use cases may not quite be what we think they could be today. But others might surprise. And some might kick into action sooner, some might just take longer to kick into action. So you need to diversify in terms of technologies, but also in time horizons,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really pick winners and losers at this point. We\u2019re just too early. And that is at least how we think about it,\u201d he said.\n\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"After years of rampant growth, payment service Mollie is implementing its first reorganization and layoffs, founder Adriaan Mol confirmed to the Financieele Dagblad. He spoke of a relatively minor intervention, affecting less than 10 percent of Mollie\u2019s about 800 employees.\n\n\u201cThis is a consequence of the realization that our company has grown too quickly. We hired too many people in a short time and went too far. The company is no longer efficient,\u201d Mol said. The FinTech company informed its employees about the upcoming layoffs about a week and a half ago, he said. The works council, the benefits agency UWV, and the supervisory authority De Nederlandsche Bank were also informed.\n\nDiscussions are taking place with the affected employees, the company told ANP.\n\nIt is the first time that Mollie has distanced itself from its aggressive growth plans. The move illustrates a turnaround in the FinTech sector. Companies now have to pay more attention to costs as investors no longer consider FinTech as the big promise solution for all future problems, according to the newspaper. \u201cThe future looks very different than everyone thought two years ago,\u201d Mol told FD.\n\nThat became very clear last month when sector darling Adyen lost half of its stock market value in a few days after announcing disappointing figures.\n\nMollie recorded a net loss of 121.5 million euros in 2022, 70 percent more than the previous year. The company struggled with rapidly increasing personnel costs. According to Mol, the company is cutting some intermediate layers in its organizational structure and intervening in the commercial department. The customer research department may also be affected by redundancies. \u201cWe are organizing the company differently and preparing for the next phase of growth,\u201d Mol told FD.\n\nThings have been restless at Mollie for some time. The CEO and CFO left in a short period, followed by changes in the supervisory board. When asked about complaints on online platforms, Mol denied that the company board lacks vision and that there is a toxic work environment. \u201cThe organization has become flatter, with more individual responsibility,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIf you ask me, I would say that the culture has actually improved.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Just a few years ago, Chinese money was rippling across the rich world. Chinese investors were making blockbuster deals and snapping up trophy assets, from luxury homes and five-star hotels in New York to a Swiss chemical company and a German robotics giant. \n\nThat era is over.\n\nChinese investment is retreating from the West as hostility to Chinese capital has grown. Increasingly, Chinese companies are instead spending money on factories in Southeast Asia and mining and energy projects in Asia, the Middle East and South America, as Beijing seeks to cement alliances in those places and secure access to critical resources. \n\nThe biggest recipient of Chinese investment so far this year is nickel-rich Indonesia, according to a preliminary estimate of Chinese investments compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Nickel is a key component in many of the batteries used to power electric vehicles. \n\nThe shift in investment flows shows how China is responding to souring relations with the U.S.-led West, and is strengthening trade and investment links with other parts of the world, in ways that could create new fault lines in the global economy. \n\nThe retreat of Chinese money in the West could lead to less job creation in some countries, while also reducing the pool of capital into which entrepreneurs in places such as Silicon Valley can tap. China\u2019s weak economy is already depriving the world of one of its traditional growth engines.\n\nMore broadly, the shift is indicative of a world in which globalization is ebbing and geopolitical tensions are more likely to fester. \n\nDirect overseas investment from China to the rest of the world fell by 18% from a year earlier by one new measure released recently. The latest level marks a decline of 25% from a peak in 2016, as overseas mergers and acquisitions have plummeted and Beijing has tightened rules to curb capital flight. \n\n\nNew York City\u2019s Waldorf Astoria was sold to a Chinese insurer for $1.95 billion in 2015. PHOTO: KATHY WILLENS\/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDespite Beijing\u2019s easing of Covid-19 restrictions last year, China is unlikely to return to the heyday of overseas deal making, in large part because of rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and its allies, who according to analysts are blocking more Chinese investments on national security grounds.\n\nWithin China, a weakening currency, the struggling private sector and Beijing\u2019s growing focus on building up its domestic economy to enhance China\u2019s self-sufficiency will also damp its investment outflows, the analysts added.\n\n\u201cBy and large, the room for China to channel investment to foreign advanced economies is shrinking,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings. It is unlikely that China\u2019s overseas investment flows will increase significantly in the next three to five years, he said.\n\nInstead, China will likely realign investments to cement its dominance in such sectors as renewable energy and electric vehicles. That likely means doubling down on investment in emerging markets from Southeast Asia to the Middle East and Africa, as Chinese factory owners look for places to expand operations and find new customers, and Beijing focuses on markets rich in resources.\n\nThe Chinese automaker BYD said this month that it plans to invest more than $600 million in several car plants in Brazil. \n\n\u201cWhile Xi Jinping is alive, we are not going back to 2016,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, referring to the high-water mark of Chinese investment overseas. He said that while the U.S. economy isn\u2019t likely to miss Chinese capital too much, its retreat could be more painful for smaller Western economies such as Australia, Canada or Hungary.

{"text":"U.S. carriers are white-knuckling a brutal freight market. While data suggests the industry has finally reached the bottom of its freight rate bubble, a balanced market \u2014 and the relief it will deliver carriers \u2014 is likely a long way out.\n\nYet, forward-thinking shippers are moving away from bottom-of-the-barrel pricing and shifting to partners running more sustainable models.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s the hard-learned COVID lesson: Operations laser-focused on driving down costs and hyper-efficiency aren\u2019t resilient enough to weather disruption. Today, smart industry players recognize that strong, sustainable partners will buoy them when they\u2019re, once again, on the wrong side of market forces.\n\nFreight rates bottoming, not rebalancing\nOn July 8, FreightWaves reported that truckload spot rates, less estimated fuel costs, had risen about 13% since early May. This data suggests a stabilizing market, not one rebalancing. The Cass Freight Index provides additional support for a freight market cycle bottom.\n\n\u201cThe main takeaways as we close the first half of 2023 are that the market has found a demand floor and there is no strong evidence that spot rates will sustain their trend beyond the typical summer seasonality bump,\u201d said FreightWaves Market Expert and Market Analyst Zach Strickland.\n\n\nDesperation in the freight market; capacity correction on the horizon\nCarriers and 3PLs looking for promising news will find little from market analysts.\n\nExperts predict the economy will remain soft for the next four to five quarters as consumers, whose savings were depleted by inflationary prices, now face headwinds from high interest rates.\n\nAccording to FreightWaves\u2019 head of ocean intelligence, Henry Byers, the import container market will be largely static for the remainder of 2023, following the 2018-2019 trend lines. The Christmas peak: Expect it to resemble more of a gentle bump given available U.S. inventory.\n\nContract rate corrections are also looming for some. Those that locked in elevated rates during the previous RFP season have been sustained through the soft market. As large shippers enter the new RFP season this fall, those contracts won\u2019t be as favorable \u2014 falling in line with the spot market.\n\nOf course, shrinking margins and break-even rates are only part of the story. Carrier costs are simultaneously increasing.\n\nAccording to the American Transportation Research Institute\u2019s June 2023 report, \u201cAn Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking,\u201d carrier wages were up 15.5%, truck\/trailer lease and purchase payments up 18.6%, and fuel costs up 53.7% in 2022 over the previous year.\n\n\nCurrently, it costs carriers $2.06 per mile to operate, less fuel costs \u2014 an untenable situation for many.\n\nWhile Yellow\u2019s bankruptcy filing could offer a semblance of relief to its competitors, most can expect a rocky road ahead.\n\nCarriers and 3PLs chasing discount buyers will be forced from the market\nFor two years, shippers and importers got destroyed by sky-high freight rates. Some closed up shop. Now, the surviving shippers and importers are taking their pound of flesh \u2014 securing ridiculously low rates to make up for their previous two years of hardship.\n\nYellow aside, the big nationwide companies with deep pockets will weather the storm. But the 10-to-30-truck operations that make up the majority of the U.S. carrier base can\u2019t sustain these perilously low rates for long. In fact, carrier bankruptcies are already a regular drumbeat in transportation media, with the Southwest region bearing the brunt: Carriers there operate at the highest cost in the country \u2014 a $2.303 average marginal cost per mile.\n\nWhen these businesses go under, capacity will go down \u2014 not only impacting drayage but regular domestic over-the-road as well.\n\nStrong partners are key to resilience, blunting extreme freight rate swings\nRate deals and spikes don\u2019t last forever, and smart industry players know caring for the partners who will sustain them when the market inevitably shifts is mission-critical.\n\n\nShippers hold the upper hand today, and many are looking to pare down their vendors. But those who place a premium on resilience, not just price, focus on the carriers and brokers they\u2019ll need when capacity gets extremely tight. They know trusted relationships take time to build, and that they\u2019ll pay off when their partners are bombarded with 50 calls a day and prioritize their business.\n\nIn this current environment, it\u2019s not difficult to find capacity, and shippers can vet sustainable partners with a small percentage of their existing freight \u2014 providing a good test of new providers without jeopardizing existing partner relationships.\n\nAs they do, they can look for signals that the partner is built to withstand market downturns including:\n\nConsistently high on-time pickup and delivery rates.\nFair market freight rates (versus unsustainable pricing).\nCapabilities, technologies and high service levels that simplify their work.\nShippers working with 3PLs should also assess the carrier vetting and onboarding tools they have in place to protect their freight from rising fraud.\n\nWhat they\u2019ll discover is that sustainably priced carriers and 3PLs continue to invest in new processes and technologies, enabling them to better protect their business. Meanwhile, those running on fumes right now won\u2019t be able to scale when the freight market booms.\n\nOn the flip side, shippers will need to keep in mind that sustainability-minded carriers are looking for partners that:\n\nPay rates that are fair in the market rather than hammering them into the dust.\nProvide clear, accurate information.\nKeep the lines of communication open and flowing.\nAs always, the freight rate boom-and-bust cycle creates chaos in the market.\n\nBut for those who value the sustainability of their business partners, that chaos will breed opportunity.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Amazon plans to lay off 9,000 corporate and tech workers by the end of April, adding to the 18,000 roles it already cut late last year and this January, Andy Jassy, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a note to employees on Monday.\n\nThe new layoffs, which amount to less than 3 percent of its corporate work force, will target workers in some of Amazon\u2019s most profitable divisions, which had previously been spared, including Amazon\u2019s cloud computing business and advertising operations. Those two segments of the business are much higher-margin operations than Amazon\u2019s core retail business, according to financial analysts and filings.\n\nMr. Jassy wrote that the annual planning session that the company\u2019s leaders wrapped up last week had focused on streamlining costs and head count.\n\n\u201cThe overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers\u2019 lives and Amazon as a whole,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFor more than a year, Mr. Jassy has been pursuing cost cuts at Amazon. The company rapidly added employees during the pandemic and put a priority on some projects that lacked obvious ways to become profitable. He has pulled back on expansion of the company\u2019s warehouse operations, and paused work on the largest phase of Amazon\u2019s planned second headquarters near Washington, D.C.\n\nInside the World of Big Tech\nTikTok: TikTok was fined roughly $370 million by E.U. regulators for having weak safeguards to protect the personal information of children using the platform, a sign of increased scrutiny facing the social media service.\nApple: At an age in which most consumer devices have lost some of their appeal to users, the company has remarkably increased its share of smartphone sales over less expensive rivals.\nGoogle Antitrust Trial: The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case against the tech giant is the greatest legal threat the company has ever faced. Google hopes the stolid approach of its top lawyer will once again prevail.\nFacial Recognition Technology: Engineers at Facebook and Google built tools years ago that could put a name to any face. But for once, Silicon Valley did not want to move fast and break things.\nThe company froze hiring last fall and by November had plans to lay off about 10,000 employees, a target that expanded to 18,000 in early January.\n\nAmazon had about 380,000 corporate employees at the end of 2022, according to a person familiar with its work force.\n\nMost of Amazon\u2019s roughly 1.5 million employees are hourly workers who power its warehouse operations.\n\nThe tech industry is undergoing its largest contraction since the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Nearly every major tech company has laid off workers. Last week Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced plans to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, part of what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called a \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d It had already laid off 11,000 workers late last year.\n\nAt Amazon, last year the initial layoffs affected employees working on the Alexa voice assistant and devices, then they spread to other divisions, including teams working on plans for automated stores, drones and the company\u2019s broader consumer retail business. Human resources employees \u2014 recruiters in particular \u2014 were affected as well.\n\nIn the latest quarter, which ended in December, Amazon reported almost no profit, driven in part by unexpected weakness in its cloud computing business.\n\nTwitch, the livestreaming site popular with video gamers that Amazon bought in 2014, said it was laying off more than 400 people, about 22 percent of its total staff. In the uncertain economy, \u201cuser and revenue growth has not kept pace with our expectations,\u201d Dan Clancy, Twitch\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post. Mr. Clancy took over as chief executive from Twitch\u2019s longtime leader, Emmett Shear, last week.\n\nAmazon\u2019s share price was down a little more than 1 percent at the close of trading on Monday.\n\nMr. Jassy said that management had not yet determined the workers who would be laid off, but that it expected to do so by mid to late April. He said the company could still pursue some \u201climited hiring\u201d in strategic areas.\n\nKellen Browning contributed reporting from San Francisco\n","labels":["None"]}
