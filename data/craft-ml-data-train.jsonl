{"text":"The shift in strategy shows how tough change can be for an institution like Goldman, industry sources said.\n\nIn 2019, Goldman acquired United Capital Financial Partners for $750 million and then renamed it Personal Financial Management. The RIA unit targets high-net-worth clients, but not the ultra-wealthy, who have accounts with $20 million to $50 million and are the typical target client for the giant investment bank.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs said it was considering selling Personal Financial Management in a bid to shift its focus back to the ultra-rich and away from the merely rich, or the millionaire next door type.\n\nOn Monday, the bank ended a week of speculation by announcing it was selling the RIA business to Creative Planning, a leading RIA with $245 billion in client assets. Terms of the deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, were not disclosed.\n\nGoldman\u2019s decision was not a surprise to some in the broad financial advice marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe brand didn\u2019t translate as powerfully as [Goldman Sachs management] thought to Main Street from the ivory tower,\u201d said Ron Carson, founder and CEO of Carson Group, during an interview for an episode of the InvestmentNews Podcast.\n\nInstead of focusing on the day-to-day business of financial advisors, Goldman will continue to work with them through its asset management and fund platform, as well as its nascent RIA custody business.

{"text":"There's an expression crypto enthusiasts use, with fingers crossed, in the hopes a particular digital currency's value will blast off: \"To the moon!\"\n\nMuch of crypto did graze the stratosphere at the start of 2022, when enthusiasm was astronomically high, but a few months later it all came crashing back down to Earth.\n\nBitcoin's value is roughly a fourth of what it was a year ago, and the industry is just starting to grapple with the fallout from the catastrophic implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nIn the future, 2022 may be regarded as a turning point for the world of virtual currencies, when they lost their luster and were cast out as a fringe product most people approach with skepticism and caution. Or it may simply be remembered as a stretch of excruciating growing pains for an industry still in its infancy.\n\nRegardless, 2022 was one for the crypto history books.\n\nHow it started\nThe ads were everywhere \u2014 on TV, on bus stops, and even in fortune cookies. Crypto companies spent tens of millions of dollars on marketing, swamping the Super Bowl with commercials. The currencies and tokens may have been virtual, but crypto became more real for many Americans in the early months of the year.\n\nThe industry seemed to reach \"peak hype\" in January and February, says Molly White, a fellow at Harvard University who is a crypto skeptic. She runs the site Web3 is Going Just Great.\n\n\"Prices had hit all-time highs,\" she says. \"People were making irrational amounts of money.\"\n\nThe value of the most famous cryptocurrency \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 had just set a record, and the industry was trying to \"mainstream itself,\" as White puts it. Meaning, crypto companies were doing all they could to bring in more customers.\n\n\nA statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, a presumed pseudonym used by the inventor of bitcoin, is displayed in Graphisoft Park in 2021 in Budapest, Hungary. The statue's creators, Reka Gergely and Tamas Gilly, used anonymized facial features, as Nakamoto's true identity remains unconfirmed.\nJanos Kummer\/Getty Images\nA woman better known for setting fashion trends than financial ones, Paris Hilton, appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in January. After talking about her recent marriage and trip to Burning Man, the former reality TV star went deep on the NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, she was hawking.\n\nThe audience seemed a bit perplexed when she promised, Oprah-style, to give each of them an NFT \u2014 another kind of digital asset that is basically cartoony crypto art. But when Fallon, who is himself an NFT enthusiast, seemed blown away, they applauded.\n\n\"Peak hype,\" though, crested quickly.\n\nHow it's going\nLike just about everything else in finance, crypto saw its prices tank when the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates to fight high inflation.\n\nThat shocked many of bitcoin's biggest backers, many of whom believed the virtual currency would be an inflation hedge, like gold. They had predicted bitcoin's value would rise during a period of high inflation; instead, it was falling.\n\nWhat's called a \"crypto winter\" \u2014 a downturn that has gone on and on \u2014 began before 2022 even reached its halfway point.\n\n\"You know, we've been living in the 'crypto winter' for the better part of a year,\" says Lee Reiners, who teaches cryptocurrency law at Duke University.\n\n\nIndividual investors have been hurt, especially people who bought digital assets near the highs. But according to Reiners, the crypto winter also revealed larger, systemic problems in the industry.\n\n\"It really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity,\" he says.\n\nA string of failures started in May: a pair of cryptocurrencies called Terra and Luna, the trading platform Voyager, a crypto hedge fund called Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Celsius ...\n\nThe list goes on and on, and according to Reiners, it highlights something troublesome about crypto.\n\n\"These firms are deeply interconnected, and so, the moment you kind of have one problem somewhere in the crypto sector, it spreads very, very quickly,\" he says.\n\nFinancial regulators started to crack down, as well. They even went after another big-name celebrity for how she touted \"EMAX tokens.\" None other than Kim Kardashian had to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October for more than $1 million.\n\nAnd what's next\nWhich brings us to FTX.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the crypto company was valued at $32 billion. Now, it's bankrupt, more than a million people are worried the money they put into it has vanished, and the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been charged with criminal fraud.\n\n\nFTX's new CEO, John J. Ray III, testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing on the company's collapse.\nNathan Howard\/Getty Images\nBankman-Fried cultivated an image that made him memorable and seemingly accessible, with wild hair and a penchant for wearing shorts and T-shirts. His goal was to get more everyday people to buy crypto and more conventional Wall Street firms and funds to invest in it.\nThe 30-year-old was so successful at bringing crypto to the masses that he was considered the industry's unofficial spokesman. He's currently under house arrest at his parents' home in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nReiners calls the swift and total collapse of FTX \"the biggest event in crypto's history\" \u2014 a history, he adds, that's \"replete with a lot of failures and scams and frauds and hacks.\"\n\nNow, people are wondering what could be the next domino to fall.\n\nBinance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and after several big waves of panic-driven withdrawals, it looks like it has the potential to be that domino.\n\nBut the company is pushing back against fears and crypto skepticism, more generally. It has to, said White.\n\n\"If people start to question the industry as a whole, or crypto as an asset class, that is devastating for Binance,\" she says. \"So, they are doing anything they can to prevent that from happening.\"\n\nFor many, it's disorienting to see how quickly crypto's fortunes reversed, and they are struggling to gauge the depth of the damage from FTX.\n\n\"I think crypto would be lucky if all they were set back [was] by a couple of years,\" White says.\n\nTrue believers expect bitcoin will bounce back and this \"crypto winter\" will thaw eventually.\n\nBut for people who weren't deep into crypto \u2014 who maybe saw an ad or who were driven by a fear of missing out to dabble in buying tokens \u2014 it's a different story, especially with daily revelations from Bankman-Fried's former co-workers about how customer money was allegedly moved out of FTX and into their own pockets.\n\n\"I think people are starting to think of crypto as this big scam that they would not want anything to do with,\" White says.\n\nAnd that poses an existential problem for crypto, she adds. Because, for it to work, it requires an ever-larger stream of people to keep buying it.","labels":["financial_distress","investments"]}

{"text":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp contraction in both demand and supply, driven by lockdown measures adopted in many countries across the globe in response to the severity of the contagion and its geographical spread. The global nature of the crisis meant that firms engaged in international trade were exposed to international disruptions on top of domestic ones, with weaker foreign demand for exporting firms, and a reduction in supply translating into shortages of intermediate inputs for importing firms. Firms involved in global value chains (GVCs) \u2013 namely, firms that both import intermediate inputs and export goods \u2013 faced these two additional challenges to their ability to produce and therefore sell their goods (Baldwin and Tomiura 2020). In this context, the further upstream the disruption occurs, the greater is the potential for supply bottlenecks to propagate negative shocks. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a debate among academics and policymakers on whether supply value chain trade is primarily a source of vulnerability or a source of resilience (Mirodout 2020, Baldwin and Freeman 2022).\n\n\nIn our recent paper (Lebastard et al. 2023), we exploit rich customs data covering all French firms engaged in international trade to estimate the impact of supply chain linkages on exporting activity during the pandemic. 1 The monthly frequency of the data allows us to differentiate between three periods during the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis. The first phase was between February and April 2020, when lockdowns caused activity to come to an abrupt halt in a number of non-essential manufacturing and services sectors. The second phase was between May and August 2020, when exports recovered to some extent in response to the gradual lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. The third phase was from September 2020 to the end of 2021, when disruptions to global supply chains emerged and progressively intensified. We focus on all firms that had exported every month between July and December 2019. Within this sample, our treatment group comprises all exporting firms that had imported intermediate inputs at least once over the same period. We assess firms\u2019 performance during the crisis, in terms of export sales and probability of survival in the export market. The richness of the dataset allows us to then deepen our analysis and look at several sources of heterogeneity. In particular, we investigate the extent to which the pandemic had a differential impact depending on whether firms are located more upstream or downstream along the value chain and on whether they diversify the countries from which they source their inputs.\n\nFirms in global value chains: Comparing the COVID-19 crisis and the great financial crisis\nOur data show that firms involved in global production networks in the pre-crisis period experienced the sharpest fall in exports at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, and recovered at a slower pace than non-GVC exporters after the economic reopening (Figure 1, panel a). In April 2020 GVC exporters recorded export volumes that were 42% lower than the levels recorded in January 2020. For non-GVC exporters, the cumulative decline was less drastic, reaching a trough in May 2020 at 28% below the level recorded in January 2020. The two groups diverged further when the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted in the summer of 2020 and when the recovery took shape over the following year. By March 2021 nominal exports of firms not involved in global value chains had reached their January 2020 levels and by September 2021 they had recovered well beyond their pre-pandemic levels, while it took until December 2021 for GVC firms to exceed their January 2020 export levels.\n\nFigure 1 Export performance over time of GVC firms and non-GVC firms\n\na) COVID-19 crisis (total exports, January 2020 = 100)\n\nExport performance over time of global value chain firms and non-Export performance over time of global value chain firms and non global value chain firms during the COVID-19 crisis.\nExport performance over time of global value chain firms and non-Export performance over time of global value chain firms and non global value chain firms during the COVID-19 crisis.

We only include firms that exported every month in the pre-crisis period. GVC firms are included if they imported at least once during the six months before the crisis.\n\nInterestingly, during the 2008 global financial crisis the situation was reversed (Figure 1, panel b), with GVC firms recording much smaller reductions in their nominal exports than their non-GVC counterparts. Compared with August 2008, nominal exports of GVC firms had fallen by 19% in August 2009, while exports of similar non-GVC firms had fallen by a quarter at their lowest point in May 2009. In comparison with the COVID-19 crisis, the collapse in trade in 2008 was less sizeable and less abrupt, although it was more persistent for both types of firm, suggesting that whether supply value chain trade is mainly a source of vulnerability or a source of resilience ultimately depends on the nature of the crisis.\n\n\nThe pandemic had a relatively greater impact on GVC firms\u2019 exports, especially when supply disruptions intensified\nFigure 2 illustrates the estimated effect of participation in global value chains on firm-level exports. Our treatment group includes all continuous exporters that had imported at least once between July and December 2019; the control group is the remaining exporting firms in the dataset, i.e. those that did not import over that period. Our results point to the emergence in April and May 2020 of the first negative and significant effect of being part of a global value chain during the pandemic, and a new more sizeable and persistent decline in exports starting in October 2020. 2 Estimates from a difference-in-differences model show that indeed over the latter period exports by non-GVC firms benefited from the pent-up demand and accumulated savings, while those of GVC firms remained constrained owing to protracted unavailability of imported inputs. 3\n\nFigure 2 Event study, effect of the pandemic on GVC firms\u2019 exports\n\nEffect of the pandemic on value chain firms\u2019 exports.\nEffect of the pandemic on value chain firms\u2019 exports. Image: CEPR\nAdditional evidence shows that firm survival followed a similar trend to that observed for exports, pointing to a greater discontinuity of trade flows for GVC firms.\n\nFirms further downstream hit the hardest\nWe exploit the richness of the dataset to deepen our analysis and assess whether the negative impact of GVC participation on export performance differed depending on firms\u2019 position along the value chain. In particular, based on Antra\u0300s et al. (2012) we use the latest OECD Input-Output Tables to compute an index of upstreamness of production for 45 sectors. We then combine this measure of industry-level upstreamness with product-level information on firm trade flows following Chor et al. (2021), computing for each firm an average of the respective index of import and export upstreamness. We find that participation in GVCs increased firm vulnerability during the pandemic, with the negative impact of supply disruptions being greater for firms located relatively more downstream in the value chain. In particular, GVC firms in the lower half of the index distribution saw their exports decrease by about 8% compared with non-GVC exporters during the lockdown, while the remaining \u2013 more upstream \u2013 GVC firms did not have significantly worse export performances than non-GVC firms (Figure 3). Both upstream and downstream GVC firms were strongly negatively affected during the period from September 2020 to December 2021, when disruptions along value chains were at historically high levels, although downstream firms were most affected.\n\nFigure 3 Difference-in-differences, effect of being downstream or upstream\n\nEffect of being downstream or upstream. value chain\nEffect of being downstream or upstream Image: CEPR\nThe fact that downstream firms were hit harder would seem to confirm that, although negative shocks occurred in both demand and supply during the pandemic, supply shocks were indeed predominant. In this respect, the COVID-19 crisis differed from the global financial crisis, which was mainly a result of a demand shock propagating up the value chain via adjustments of firms\u2019 inventory holdings (the so-called bullwhip effect, as in Altomonte et al. 2012).\n\nMore diversified sourcing networks for core imported inputs partially shielded firms from shocks\nThe pandemic has raised the question of whether diversification would foster supply chain resilience and therefore help reduce countries\u2019 vulnerability to future external shocks. We try to shed some light on this by estimating the effect of diversification of imports among GVC firms on their export performance. We follow the approach in Lafrogne-Joussier et al. (2022), where a firm is considered as diversifying its GVC involvement whenever its \u2018core\u2019 imported products (i.e. representing at least 1% of its imports before the pandemic) are sourced from at least two countries. In our study, however, we test the effect of diversification by allowing the threshold for a product to be identified as \u2018core\u2019 to vary between 1% and 30% of total imports between July and December 2019. Our results, as shown in Figure 4 below, suggest that exports of GVC firms suffered from the lack of diversification for products representing more than 15% of total imports.\n\nFigure 4 Difference-in-differences, effect of diversification of source countries for core inputs\n\nEffect of diversification of source countries for core inputs. value chain\nEffect of diversification of source countries for core inputs. Image: CEPR\nConclusions\nIn this column we investigate the impact of supply chain linkages on exporting firms during the pandemic. Highly granular data for the universe of French exporters allow us to provide one of the first firm-level quantifications of the impact of supply bottlenecks that occurred in 2021, when disruptions along value chains were at historically high levels. We find that exporters in global value chains suffered relatively more than other exporters during the COVID-19 crisis. This was the case both in terms of export losses and in terms of the greater likelihood of discontinuity in export relations, particularly when supply disruptions were at historically high levels. This additional negative effect was mostly driven by exporters at downstream production stages, whereas diversifying sourcing networks for core imports helped to buffer the impact.\n\nAuthors\u2019 Note: This column first appeared as a Research Bulletin of the European Central Bank.

{"text":"The \u201cnew normal\u201d is looking a lot like the old normal as U.S. imports continue to fall. Volumes began declining sharply in September and were already close to 2019 levels by the end of last year. They\u2019re expected to pull even with pre-COVID numbers this month and next.\n\nThe \u201cpandemic-driven surge [is] finally over,\u201d said the National Retail Federation (NRF).\n\nThe NRF publishes the monthly Port Tracker report together with Hackett Associates. \u201cImport patterns appear to be returning to what was normal prior to 2020,\u201d said Hackett Associates founder Ben Hackett.\n\nPort Tracker covers 12 U.S. ports. While final counts are not in yet, it estimated the ports it covers handled 1.88 million twenty-foot equivalent units in December, down 10.1% year on year. \n\nPort Tracker forecasts that import volumes in January and February will be roughly even with pre-COVID levels then will bounce back above them again in March-May.\n\n\nVolumes through November 2022 are final counts; December 2022-May 2023 are projected. (Chart: FreightWaves based on data from National Retail Federation)\nAnother data provider, Descartes, reported imports for all U.S. ports totaled 1,929,032 TEUs in December, just 1.3% higher than imports in December 2019, pre-COVID.\n\nLast month\u2019s imports were down 19.3% year on year and down 1.3% versus November, according to Descartes.\n\nCountrywide volumes are close to pre-boom levels, but there are still some big differences.\n\nOcean schedules have improved, but delays remain higher than they used to be. In the first week of January, the Flexport Ocean Timeliness Indicator for the Asia-U.S. route was still 25% higher than three years ago.\n\nThe coastal mix is also much different. Ports on the East and Gulf coasts continue to handle significantly higher volumes than before the pandemic. Volumes on the West Coast are much lower than they used to be. \n\nA new West Coast dockworker labor contract has still not been signed, over seven months after the last one expired.\n\n\n\u201cThe continuing labor uncertainty could be a significant reason why import volumes are not shifting back to major California ports despite their improving situation,\u201d said Chris Jones, executive vice president of industry and services at Descartes.\n\nThe COVID-19 situation in China presents another ongoing complication for supply chains. \u201cCOVID infection is widespread and given that the Chinese population has little to no immunity, the impact of COVID on manufacturing supply chains could continue for quite some time,\u201d noted Jones.\n\nThere could also be another inventory effect ahead \u2014 this time in the opposite direction. In 2022, importers brought in too much; at some point in 2023, they may find they have too little.\n\n\u201cPeople \u2026 will see that underlying consumer demand is actually relatively healthy and all of a sudden, they\u2019ll become concerned that their inventories are a bit on the low end and we\u2019ll possibly see a bounce-back,\u201d said Hapag-Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen last year.\n\nHackett predicted, \u201cAs inflation eases and consumer spending returns, we project that growth will slowly return going into the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Recent organizing victories at high-profile, private-sector employers such as Amazon, Starbucks and Trader Joe's suggest that U.S. workers can form unions in industries previously considered unorganizable.\n\nDespite the wins, unions often don't reach legally binding collective bargaining agreements with employers that give workers more say about pay, benefits and protections.\n\nIn fact, new ILR research finds that the odds of winning a first contract within 18 months of employees voting to form a union decrease by about 71% when an employer impedes contract negotiations by committing unfair labor practices.\n\nPublished February 25 in the Industrial Relations Journal, \"Breaking the deadlock: How union and employer tactics affect first contract achievement,\" was co-authored by ILR Ph.D. students Johnnie Kallas and Dongwoo Park, and University of Windsor Assistant Professor Rachel Aleks.\n\n\"A lot of people assume, and rightfully so, that if you win a union election, you should be able to negotiate a contract. But the reality is that less than half have a contract one year after an election,\" Kallas said. \"We have nothing in U.S. labor law to compel an employer to reach agreement on a first contract, which is really the problem that a lot of current organizing campaigns are coming up against.\n\n\"So, just because you win an election doesn't mean you're able to make tangible gains at your workplace. You need to then, after winning a grueling election, be able to negotiate a first contract. It's a distinct process that comes with its own challenges, which we try to demonstrate in our paper.\"\n\nEmployer opposition has a negative effect on unions achieving a first contract, researchers said. Many engage in illegal tactics, called unfair labor practices, such as spreading rumors about job loss and plant closings. They also use legal means, such as captive audience meetings, to delay the process.\n\nIn 39% of cases, employers retained the use of an anti\u2010union consultant and engaged in tactics to minimize support for the union even after union certification. These tactics, including making promises, unilaterally changing terms and conditions of work, and threatening closure, were used in 38%, 32% and 25% of cases, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, researchers found that engaging with the public, similar to the effort needed for winning worker approval for forming a union, improves the chances of establishing an agreement.\n\nThe researchers argue that for unions to achieve a first contract, workers should build external leverage by mobilizing community leaders and workers at other unionized sites. Examples of this strategy yielding positive results include the Maine State Nurses Association, which ratified its first contract in September 2022 after holding a series of public rallies, and a first contract achieved by graduate students at Clark University in October 2022.\n\nPark said, \"Unions need to get a first contract, so they may want to call a strike or just talk to the employers privately. But what we found is that what is more important than those kinds of internal tactics is the need to involve community groups, or other groups outside the union, to build solidarity, make their case more visible and to bring shame to the employers.\"\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"The 2008 financial crisis in the US kicked off a debt supercycle, which spread to Europe in 2010 and has recently engulfed many of the world\u2019s low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Could the debt woes of Country Garden, the behemoth Chinese real estate developer now facing billions of dollars in losses, augur the cycle\u2019s next turn?\n\nThe answer remains unclear. While the Chinese authorities have a remarkable track record when it comes to containing economic crises, the challenges posed by a significant growth slowdown, combined with high debt levels \u2013 especially for local governments and the property sector \u2013 are unprecedented.\n\nChina\u2019s current problems can be traced back to its massive post-2008 investment stimulus, a significant portion of which fuelled the real estate construction boom. After years of building housing and offices at breakneck speed, the bloated property sector \u2013 which accounts for 23% of the country\u2019s GDP (26% counting imports) \u2013 is now yielding diminishing returns. This comes as little surprise, as China\u2019s housing stock and infrastructure rival that of many advanced economies while its per capita income remains comparatively low.\n\nIs the era of zero interest rates gone for good?\nJeffrey Frankel\nRead more\nAt the same time, in what had once seemed like a race between a tortoise and a hare, the US is speeding toward artificial intelligence-powered technological innovation and higher long-term economic growth. As the highly respected Wall Street Journal economics commentator Greg Ip recently put it, \u201cNo one talks about secular stagnation now,\u201d referring to a theory that a chronic deficiency in global demand and economically important innovation will hold down growth and real interest rates long into the future.\n\nFunnily enough, I said much the same at a conference seven years ago. In my presentation, which was based on my 2015 paper debt supercycle, not secular stagnation, I explained that post-crisis malaise was typical and would at least partly fade. I then conjectured: \u201cIn nine years, nobody will be talking about secular stagnation\u201d \u2013 a perhaps hyperbolic remark to underscore the point. (I am grateful that one of my co-panellists, J Bradford Delong, quoted me on his blog, perhaps forgetting that the conference was held under Chatham House rules.)\n\nMy greatest concern has never been an end to innovation but that the rise of AI will outpace our ability to control it\nOver the past decade, the overwhelming consensus in academic and policy circles has been that the world is deeply mired in an era of ultra-low interest rates driven by weak growth fundamentals. And in fact, it remains so today. For example, the Northwestern University economist Robert J Gordon\u2019s magisterial history The Rise and Fall of American Growth offers persuasive arguments for the death of innovation and the end of growth. Gordon posits that post-1970s inventions \u2013 even the computer revolution \u2013 are not nearly as economically important as, say, the steam engine or electricity generation.\n\n\nThe billionaire investor Peter Thiel and the former world chess champion Garry Kasparov made similar arguments in a 2012 debate on the topic of \u201cinnovation or stagnation\u201d at the University of Oxford. Arguing on the \u201cinnovation\u201d side of that debate, I pointed to advances in chess that heralded the coming of an AI age, while also noting that commercial innovation invariably stalls at times, for example during the Great Depression. In fact, my greatest concern has never been an end to innovation but rather that the rise of AI will outpace our ability to control it.\n\nThere are strong arguments for secular stagnation on the demand side, owing to demographic decline. In a brilliant 2013 speech, the Harvard economist Lawrence H Summers argued that only a continuing shortfall in global demand could explain the era\u2019s ultra-low interest rates, triggering an avalanche of research on fundamentals that could explain the demand deficiency. Progressive politicians have used this work to make the case that bigger government is needed to fill the void. Summers, however, was more circumspect, advocating increased investment in infrastructure and education, and outright transfers from rich to poor \u2013 ideas with which I strongly agree.\n\nBut despite some good arguments for secular stagnation, concerns about sustained slower growth are overblown. Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan have challenged the view that demographic decline inevitably lowers demand by pointing to the rapidly growing elderly population.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\n\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, interest rates also fell to zero during the Great Depression and stayed there \u2013 until they didn\u2019t. Notably, the rate on 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury bonds is currently well above its average level of about zero from 2012 to 2021.\n\nThe debt supercycle may have lasted longer than initially expected, perhaps because of the coronavirus pandemic. But it was a critical piece of the story, and now, as China\u2019s economy falters, it is the best explanation for what might come next.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","financial_distress"]}

{"text":"Croatia, the European Union\u2019s newest member, adopted the euro as its currency on Jan. 1, making it the 20th country to join the euro area. The move vaulted the nation of around 4 million people into the EU\u2019s core, making payments easier and cheaper and giving its financial system a safety net in future crises. The country, with an economy highly dependent on foreign tourists, also joined the Schengen zone, which allows easier travel around Europe. \n\nGet a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.\n1. Why did Croatia join the euro?\n\nCroatia began its push to join the single currency as soon as it won membership in the EU in 2013. The move is partly aimed at cementing a Western alignment after about half a century of communist rule following World War II as part of Yugoslavia. (Its accession had been delayed by the bloody wars in the 1990s around the disintegration of that country.)    \n\n2. What about the economic logic?\n\nThat\u2019s arguably even more compelling. The country relies more than any other EU state on tourists, who generate a fifth of gross domestic product and find vacationing much easier when they don\u2019t have to grapple with exchange rates. Meanwhile, most private and corporate bank deposits in Croatia are held in euros, along with more than two-thirds of debt totaling about 520 billion kuna ($74 billion). Euro-area membership can lower interest rates, improve credit ratings and make Croatia more attractive to investors, according to central bank Governor Boris Vujcic.\n\n3. What are the pros?\n\nAdopting the euro formalizes a chunk of economic activity that\u2019s already carried out using the common currency \u2014 from apartment and car sales to short-term rentals for vacationers. It trims foreign-exchange costs outside tourism to the tune of about 1.2 billion kuna a year, according to the central bank. Croatia gains access to European Central Bank liquidity and potential bailout financing from the European Stability Mechanism during periods of crisis. With Greece\u2019s troubles now largely in the rear-view mirror, there was popular support to switch to the euro. Almost all political parties backed the move. Eastern European peers Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia had already joined the single currency. ECB President Christine Lagarde said Croatia\u2019s access proves that the euro has lasting appeal.\n\n\n\n4. And the cons?\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, there\u2019s not much to lose by relinquishing control to the ECB since the kuna\u2019s exchange rate has been locked in a tight trading band to the euro and, before that, to the Deutsche Mark since the 1990s. Croatia\u2019s euro adoption will cost local banks about 1 billion kuna annually in lost conversion fees, but the switch reduces currency risks and improves stability, according to the national association of banks. The euro is also expected to have cost banks \u20ac80 million to 100 million in one-time expenditure to adapt their IT services and ATM networks. \n\n5. What hurdles did it face? \n\nEU member states gave their final approval for Croatia to join the euro on July 12, 2022. Inflation has proved the biggest challenge after the war in Ukraine sent prices of energy and other commodities soaring. But that\u2019s a problem everywhere: The pace of inflation in the euro area dropped in November, the most recent data, but consumer prices still soared 10.1% from a year earlier. \n\n\n6. What other countries want to join the euro?\n\nOne certainly does: Bulgaria. But it has pushed back its timetable by a year to 2024 after being accepted into the euro-area waiting room known as ERM-2 in 2020, the same time as Croatia. Romania has also expressed a desire. However, the biggest countries in the region aren\u2019t rushing to join, despite their obligations under EU treaties. Poland, for example, attributes its ability to survive the 2008 global financial crisis without a recession to it having retained an independent monetary policy.\n\n7. What do Croatia\u2019s new coins look like?\n\nThe coins feature a map of the country and the national checkerboard motif. They also have images of a kuna, or weasel, and feature inventor Nikola Tesla, an ethnic Serb born in the present-day Croatian town of Smiljan. Serbia\u2019s central bank had said it would take action if Croatia was allowed to use Tesla\u2019s image. \n\n\n8.

{"text":"Most readers would already know that General Electric's (NYSE:GE) stock increased by 9.0% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study General Electric's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for General Electric\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:\n\n33% = US$11b \u00f7 US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nGeneral Electric's Earnings Growth And 33% ROE\nFirstly, we acknowledge that General Electric has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 21% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, General Electric's considerable five year net income growth of 57% was to be expected.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between General Electric's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 52% in the same 5-year period.\n\npast-earnings-growth\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GE worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether GE is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs General Electric Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\nGeneral Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.4%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.\n\nMoreover, General Electric is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 6.5% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 16% over the same period.\n\nSummary\nIn total, we are pretty happy with General Electric's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

{"text":"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office detectives said two men from Broward County scammed Uber out of more than $1 million by creating fake accounts and using phony and stolen names.\n\nBSO said Trayon Morgan, 21, of Lauderhill and Roy Blackwood, 38, of Sunrise were arrested following a nearly eight-month long investigation.\nAccording to investigators, the fraud started in January 2022 and took place mainly in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Deputies said Morgan used the Uber Eats app and acted as the customer and the courier. He would place a grocery order as a consumer for pickup under a fake account and then accept the order as the courier, according to deputies. Uber would then provide Morgan with a preauthorized and preloaded credit card to make the purchase. Morgan could purchase up to $700 during a single purchase. Then, as the consumer, he would cancel the order and buy a gift card with the Uber credit card, investigators said.\n\nOn several occasions, Blackwood would drive Morgan to different Walgreens to commit the fraud, deputies said. On Jan. 24, detectives conducted a surveillance operation and saw Morgan and Blackwood travel to 27 different Walgreens committing fraud that totaled a $5,013.28 loss for Uber that day, investigators said.\n\nDeputies said Morgan created several fake accounts to keep the fraud going and would often use stolen and fabricated identities of Uber drivers, using their license information and altering it with his own photo.\n\nWith the help of Uber, and other investigative techniques, detectives were able to confirm Morgan\u2019s involvement with the fake accounts, detective said.\n\n\nDeputies issued arrest warrants for the duo on Aug. 7. Palm Beach Gardens police arrested Blackwood on Aug. 16 and BSO detectives arrested Morgan on Aug. 22 in Tamarac.\n\nThe two face charges of organized scheme to defraud and grand theft.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"From the Mancunian heartlands of Cheadle, Oldham, Gorton and Newton Heath, from Turkey itself and even as far as Australia, Manchester City supporters traveled to Istanbul from across Manchester and indeed across the world to see their team win the Champions League and complete a historic treble.\n\nWhile some will have been more recent converts, others will have followed the club from its flirt with bankruptcy in the English third division in 1999 all the way to the pinnacle of European football on the banks of the Bosporus.\n\nThey are entitled to celebrate the achievement just as much as those directly responsible for realizing it on the pitch: one of the most gifted sets of players to have ever played the game , coached by the mercurial Pep Guardiola; who, by winning his third Champions League 12 years after his second, becomes the first coach to win the treble with two different clubs.\n\nHowever, it was the presence of two men in particular at the Atat\u00fcrk Olympic Stadium, one sporting a blue and white scarf around his neck as he attended only his second ever City game, which told the real story of where professional football finds itself in 2023.\n\n\nFootball instrumentalized\nSheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi is the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and owner of the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), which took over Manchester City in 2008. It handed over control of the club in 2014 to the newly-created City Football Group (CFG), in which it retains an 81% stake. \n\nOfficially, ADUG insists it is a privately owned investment vehicle which has no links to the government of Abu Dhabi. Leaked internal documents suggest otherwise, as did the presence of Sheikh Mansour's older brother, UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, next to him in the VIP box on Saturday.\n\nFifteen years and billions of dollars on from their 2008 takeover, Sheikh Mansour and Abu Dhabi have achieved through Manchester City what they set out to do: establish the tiny emirate on the Persian Gulf as a major player in international sports.\n\nThe purpose of this has been threefold: to diversify its oil-dependent economy, bolster its geopolitical standing in a volatile region surrounded by powerful neighbors, and associate it in the global consciousness with glamor and success rather than being an autocratic monarchy presiding over well-documented human rights abuses. This phenomenon is often referred to as sportswashing.\n\nJust as with Qatar's ownership of Paris Saint-Germain, its hosting of the 2022 World Cup and its ongoing pursuit of Manchester United, and just as with Saudi Arabia's purchase of Newcastle United and effective takeover of professional golf, the ultimate purpose isn't to promote and support elite sport itself; that's just a means to an end.\n\nThose playing it, coaching it, watching it, reporting on it and celebrating it are ultimately being instrumentalized for ulterior motives, whether they like it or not.\n\nManchester City's head coach Pep Guardiola kisses the trophy after winning the Champions LeagueManchester City's head coach Pep Guardiola kisses the trophy after winning the Champions League\nPep Guardiola has won the Treble for the second time - with substantial financial backingImage: Francisco Seco\/AP Photo\/picture alliance\nAllegations of financial irregularities\nManchester City also stands accused of breaking rules in order to achieve those goals. It has been charged by the Premier League of 115 counts of financial irregularities between 2009 and 2018.\n\nIt has already been fined twice by UEFA, once for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations and a second time for obstructing an investigation \u2013 the latter after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that a number of allegations of artificially inflating sponsorship revenue from Abu Dhabi-based companies had taken place too long ago to full under its jurisdiction.\n\nOf course, none of this is the fault of Pep Guardiola, winning goalscorer Rodri, man-of-the-match John Stones, German international Ilkay G\u00fcndogan or Norwegian striking sensation Erling Haaland.\n\nThe travails of the likes of PSG, Abu Dhabi's regional rivals, and Manchester United, City's local rivals, in recent years are evidence that simply spending massive amounts of money isn't enough; it has to be spent professionally, too.\n\nNevertheless, even if City ends up being completely absolved of all accusations of financial wrongdoing, the fact remains that the recruitment, assembly and molding of a world-beating squad is a lot easier when backed by unlimited sovereign wealth, which provides the infrastructure to minimize the risk of failure and the financial cushion to mitigate it should it still occur \u2014 advantages City's rivals simply don't have.\n\nBayern fans hold banners during the Champions League quarterfinal, first leg, soccer match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich at the Etihad stadiumBayern fans hold banners during the Champions League quarterfinal, first leg, soccer match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich at the Etihad stadium\nBayern Munich fans criticized Manchester City's ownership model this seasonImage: Dave Thompson\/AP Photo\/picture alliance\nEnglish fans have no say \u2013 unlike in Germany\nMany of those City supporters who packed out one end of the Atat\u00fcrk stadium won't care; they'll feel they've deserved their moment as a reward for their loyalty over the years. And they're entitled to that.\n\nThey may also argue that, given the structural inequalities of European football, where the biggest and most successful clubs historically are continually granted the lion's share of the broadcast revenues and prize money, thus perpetuating a vicious circle and solidifying the gulf between the rich and the rest, how else could their club ever enter that exclusive group? And they'd have a point.\n\nUltimately, they may point out that they don't have a say in any of this anyway. This, at least in English football, is also the sad reality.\n\nIt was significant that, just two weeks before the Champions League final, German clubs voted against plans to secure a \u20ac2 billion investment in the Bundesliga \u2014 at least partly due to pressure exerted by supporters and members who, in adherence to the 50+1 ownership rule, retain a say in the running of their clubs.\n\nAccording to the plans, the money was supposed to have helped German clubs \u2014 such as Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig, who were all brushed aside by City on their road to Istanbul \u2014 compete in Europe.\n\nBut supporters feared that the price to pay for that would go beyond the financial \u2014 namely, 12.5% of future broadcast revenues to be paid out to a private equity investor \u2014 and actually constitute a de-facto loss of influence in their clubs, leading to potential sell-outs to investors or owners with ulterior motives.\n\nThe ultimate consequence of that was on show in the Atat\u00fcrk Stadium on Saturday night where those Manchester City supporters, whether from Cheadle or Oldham, Gorton or Newton Heath, Turkey or Australia, celebrated a triumph which they are of course free to enjoy \u2014 but which is ultimately neither sporting nor theirs.\n\nIt was geopolitical, it was financial and it belonged to the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, attending his second ever game in his blue and white scarf.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every economic sector and the shipping and trucking industries are no exception. Like a domino effect, the decline in manufacturing in other countries has reduced international trade leading to a loss of work at American ports and roads.  \n\nCargo volumes were stored at major ports but not transported; bans on international imports and exports have led to lack of productivity at these ports, leading to a loss of jobs for truck drivers, and most retailers had cancelled orders before the start of the summer. No industry around the world\u2013automotive,  pharmaceuticals, domestic goods or consumer goods\u2013was spared. \n\nImpact on American Ports:\n\nThe coronavirus hit the country\u2019s shipping ports hard, with many facing steep reductions in cargo trade compared to last year. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 COVID-19 Infrastructure Report, the economic downturn stands to cause significant damage to ports\u2019 overall volumes, to the tune of an estimated decline of 20% to 30% in total annual receipts. \n\nThe Port of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s largest port, moved 856,389 Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) in July, a 6.11% decrease. As of the end of July, overall cargo volumes had decreased 15.3%. \n\nThe Port of Long Beach actually saw an increase in cargo shipments, bucking the declining trend faced by other ports in the country. The nation\u2019s second-busiest port moved 21.1% more cargo in July 2020 compared with July 2019. Two potential causes come to mind: a lag in orders placed in 2018 may have filled inventories and shifted additional orders from 2019 to 2020, resulting in a year-over-year increase in cargo volume numbers, independent of the pandemic. Also, the Executive Director of Los Angeles Port shared in a statement that there had been a shift of some services from the Port of LA to Long Beach in June, which could have caused an additional gain for the latter and loss for the former during these months.\n\nThe Port of New York and New Jersey saw a 16.3% year-over-year decrease in total Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) in June. Imports decreased by 12.5% and exports decreased by 20.3%, while the total number of empty containers decreased by 16.3%. \n\nWhy Were the Numbers Down?\n\nThis decline can be attributed to several factors: manufacturing in countries in Asia and Europe affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; reduced demand, especially consumer demand, in the U.S. during the ongoing crisis; and the virtual standstill of manufacturing in the US  for the first few months of 2020 leading to retailers delaying, postponing or in many cases, even canceling shipping orders.\n\nLastly, most of these ports experienced record-high volume trends last year, so some of the 2020 decrease reflects reversion to the mean. \n\nImpact on the Trucking Industry:\n\nAs usual, when any mobility mode is affected, the effect reverberates throughout all modes of transportation. Trucking companies are the most used \u2018way-of-means\u2019 to move freight from port, and gate movement is seen as a reliable way of tracking truck movement in ports. Increases in gate movement show that a port is running \u2018healthy\u2019 since more trucks are required to move a surge in cargo volume (the reverse also holds true). Gate Movement Analysis data from the Port of Los Angeles show that the port activity had almost been restored to pre-pandemic levels in the months of July and August. \n\nTotal container moves in 2020 fell 6% year-over-year each month until April 2020. This deficit was reduced to 2.75% by July, demonstrating a definite uptick in summer shipping orders. \n\nTrucking Industry Status in the Tristate Area:\n\nWhen providing data sources, Lisa Yakomin, the President of the Association of Bi-State Motor Carriers (based in the Tristate area), told me that the cargo trade at PA-NY&NJ is more diversified (as compared with the ports on the West Coast like the Port of Los Angeles) with regards to the container origin, which muted the initial impact of the slowdown. \u201cThe pandemic started exploding here in NY\/NJ right on the heels of the Chinese New Year, a time when things are typically slow anyway, so that\u2019s another reason we didn\u2019t feel the effects right away.\u201d\n\nWeigh-in-motion (WIM) data from the C2SMART\u2019s testbed on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) supports Ms. Yakomin\u2019s statement. In the Center\u2019s first edition of the COVID-19 and Transportation White Paper series, C2SMART researchers showed that truck traffic had appeared to have dropped 15% on the Queens-bound route and 19% on the Staten Island-bound (SIB) route compared to pre-pandemic numbers. With fewer cars on the road and little to no traffic in March and April, the average speed range on this section of the BQE increased by approximately 5mph for both QB and SIB, a point reiterated by Ms. Yakomin as well.\n\nThis post comes from Siva Sooryaa Muruga Thambiran, an undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Civil Engineering from NYU Tandon.\n\nFigure 1: FTR\u2019s Truck Freight Recovery Index shows the impact of the pandemic on the industry in different phases (from FleetMagazineMag.com)\n\nTable 1: Comparison of cargo volume (in TEUs) for different ports in the US for the first seven months (NOTE: Numbers for PA-NY & NJ are only until June 2020)\n\nFigure 2: The Port of New York and New Jersey Freight Movement Statistics for the month of June 2020 (From PANYNJ.Gov)\n\nFigure 3: Trucking Activity at the Port of Los Angeles (from PortofLosAngeles.org)\n\nTable 2: Summary of Average WIM Data During 4 Periods; (A) Jan 1-Mar 1, 2020, (B) Mar 1- Mar 22, (C) Mar 22- May 3, (D) May 4-June 28 (E) June 29-August 15 (% percentage denotes the changes between two periods) (Data taken from the C2SMART Urban Roadway Testbed Project)\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Weekly Change in Number of Trucks (Weekday Only; Weekend Excluded) (Data taken from the C2SMART Urban Roadway Testbed Project)\nLooking at the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) numbers for the first two months of this year: for QB the number is 5927 while for SIB, it is 5495 while for the first two of weeks of March, the corresponding AADT numbers reduced by 7.8% and 4.8%. From the week of 3\/23 (until 05\/04), the AADT figures represent a -24.5% and -46.7% decline in numbers. From the week of 05\/04 until the last week of June, the AADT numbers were up by 34.9% for QB and 38.7% for SIB, while the corresponding numbers in the next time period until August 10 were 1.2% and 0.55%; indicating a possible uptick in shipping orders as the state economy slowly reopened.\n\nLooking at the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) numbers for the first two months of this year: for QB the number is 5927 while for SIB, it is 5495 while for the first two of weeks of March, the corresponding AADT numbers for QB and SIB are 5458 and 5233 respectively showing a delayed  or reduced effect. From the week of 3\/23 (until 05\/04), the AADT for QB and SIB are 4119 and 3568, representing a -24.5% and -31.8% decline in numbers. From the week of 05\/04 until the last week of June, the AADT numbers were up to 5559 for QB and 4949 for SIB, while the corresponding numbers in the next time period until August 10 were 5626 and 4976; indicating a possible uptick in shipping orders as the state economy slowly reopened.\n\nData presented covers FHWA Class 9 through Class 13 of 5 or more axles. \n\nAs seen in Figure 4, freight volumes at PA-NY&NJ dropped off considerably in late March and April, before slowly picking up in May. Most retail stores and other small businesses were closed, many customers cancelled their summer orders, vessel sailings were cancelled, and freight volume dropped precipitously. This had a corresponding effect on truck movement as well.\n\nThe Future\n\nLooking ahead, it will be interesting to see if shipments during the holiday season will be drastically affected. Usually, orders are placed starting from June, but with this year, all timeline scenarios have been thrown off due to the pandemic. While it was expected that a second wave of hospitalizations due to the pandemic would have had an impact on the shipping industry, so far there has not been a drastic change. \n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Globalisation is being rewired, from how it operates to what it fundamentally means. Reshoring remains a dominant topic. Discussions at August\u2019s Jackson Hole economic symposium in the US centred around structural shifts in the global economy, with speeches focused on the looming \u201cgreat reallocation\u201d.\nBroadly speaking, data continues to highlight that companies have diversified their supply chains, with plans for much more to come. Supply chain localisation, amid trade tensions, geopolitics, energy security and the risk of supply chain disruptions, is likely to remain a key theme for the next decade.\nThe supply chain management strategies that prevailed before 2020 were focused on achieving cost efficiency. Firms scoured the globe for the cheapest suppliers, which in turn often resulted in widespread and complex supply chains that spanned national borders. Another goal was to keep inventories as lean as possible to minimise the cost of financing.\nThis move towards supply chain complexity evolved over decades, motivated in part by the rise of Japanese manufacturers whose exports were considerably more competitive than those of their rivals. One key element of this competitive advantage was the practice of \u201c just in time\u201d inventory management, which subsequently became widespread.\n\nConcurrently, policymakers\u2019 commitment to pursue a more globalised economy, including efforts to bring down tariffs and remove barriers to capital flows, contributed to vertical specialisation. This allowed firms and countries to concentrate on certain links in the supply chain.\n\nIndia, Vietnam to gain from supply chain shifts away from China\n10 Jan 2023\n\nThis trend was reinforced by a reduction in underlying transport costs, as well as advances in information and communication technology. Firms were increasingly free to seek out the world\u2019s cheapest suppliers. At the same time, this process tightened global interdependence, especially between East Asian economies and the rest of the world.\nThese approaches were conditioned on the assumption that global links were reliable, predictable and cost-effective. However, the system\u2019s vulnerabilities were highlighted by the pandemic and exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. As supply chain disruptions wove their way through the global economy, they forced companies and governments alike to rethink, reinvent and reinvest in their supply chains.\nOne highly ambitious home-shoring test case is 2022\u2019s US Chips and Science Act, which is providing some US$280 billion in new funding to bolster research and development and the United States\u2019 domestic semiconductor industry. The legislation spurred the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world\u2019s largest chip maker, to invest US$40 billion in two factories in Arizona, with the potential of greatly boosting the US\u2019 ability to craft large volumes of semiconductors.\n\nSupply chain shifts have also resulted in investments outside the US. Notably, the technology supply chain has witnessed rising investment in areas outside China for several years now.\n\nSmartphone and tech hardware assembly has been highly concentrated in China, but suppliers are working to introduce new production capacity, especially in Mexico, India and Southeast Asia, where nations such as Vietnam and Thailand should see a rise in areas of manufacturing such as wearables, electronic components and batteries.\n\nIndia is also well positioned to benefit from the pattern of shifting supply chains. The focus has been on indigenisation as the government has taken significant steps to increase exports and rationalise imports. This could help India address some of its long-standing issues, such as manufacturing\u2019s low share of GDP, which has been stuck around 15 per cent for the past decade.\nAdditionally, the country is running a high current-account deficit. But India is projected to reach US$1 trillion in goods exports by 2028, representing a steep 17 per cent increase. In addition, New Delhi aims to increase manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP to 25 per cent from the current 17.7 per cent by 2025. As part of that effort, it is addressing all its legacy bottlenecks linked to industrial production and is focusing on improving the ease of doing business.\nMobile manufacturing is one of India\u2019s success stories. It fell to insignificant levels after Nokia\u2019s India manufacturing operations shut down in the mid-2010s, but the government took measures to revitalise the sector. It introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme and raised import duties on finished mobile phones.\n\nIndia then followed up with import duties on certain components to promote the \u201cassembly, programming, testing and packaging\u201d model of manufacturing. It enjoyed some success through this initiative, with the number of mobile phone manufacturing plants rising from just two in 2014 to 105 in 2019. Production increased from US$11 billion in 2017 to US$30 billion in 2021, while exports in that time frame rose from US$200 million to US$4 billion.\n\nOther schemes with a focus on increasing scale and added value followed. India introduced the Electronics Manufacturing Cluster and a scheme to promote programmes for the manufacturing of electronic components and semiconductors in 2020, which essentially offered capital expenditure subsidies. This was followed by the Production Linked Incentive scheme to encourage local production, allowing for 4 to 6 per cent incentives on incremental indigenous production.\nReshoring, nearshoring and friend-shoring are undoubtedly in focus for the global economy, and opportunities are vast. However, supply chain rewiring is complex as it requires substantial investment and is likely to take years to bear fruit. Complexities flow from decisions made by firms about production, shipping and inventory management.\n\nProducing requires setting production plans, finding suppliers, locating workers and the decisions of millions of people about whether to enter the labour force and, if so, what job to take. Geopolitics, incentives and labour market dynamics are at play and will collectively conspire to define the real winners of this great reallocation.","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Belgium has raised a record 21.9 billion euros ($23.65 bln) from savers in a bond sale designed to compete with bank deposits, a sign of growing popularity for government debt as discontent grows with lenders failing to keep up with surging interest rates.\n\nThe sale, launched on Aug. 24, was aimed at pressuring banks to raise deposit rates. It marks the biggest funding drive from households in Belgium's history and is likely Europe's biggest retail bond sale, the country's debt agency said on Monday.\n\nEquivalent to around 5% of Belgian deposits, it eclipses the 5.7 billion euros raised from savers at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011 and beats the 18 billion euros Italy raised from savers earlier this year.\n\nEuropean lenders awash with cash have resisted raising savings rates while market interest rates have surged as central banks fight inflation, prompting withdrawals by households looking for better returns.\n\nBonds issued by governments targeted at savers have become a popular alternative. Italy and Portugal have this year shifted big slices of their funding programmes to households.\n\nThe scale of demand for the bond was \"a clear signal for the banks,\" Belgian finance minister Vincent Van Peteghem told Reuters, adding he had never expected the sale to prove so popular.\n\n\"Savers are giving a signal to their banks to say: we are expecting a higher return than the one that you are offering nowadays on your savings accounts. We ask at least the same respect that you have for your shareholders,\" he said.\n\nBelgium's one-year bond pays an interest rate of 3.3%, above the 2.5% and often much lower rates on savings accounts, according to aggregator website Spaargids.\n\nIT CRASH\nJean Deboutte, a director at the debt agency, said high demand led to its IT systems crashing several times during the sale.\n\n\"At one point in time we had one subscription per second.\" he said. \"That's a figure one would find with Amazon.\"\n\nAcross Europe, governments are seeking ways to compensate households taking a blow from the surging cost of living while missing out on the benefit of rising interest rates.\n\nItaly recently dealt a blow to banks with a one-off tax on their excess profits.\n\nWhile demand for the bond is high, the country's biggest lenders are yet to raise rates paid on savings accounts.\n\n\"It is now up to every bank individually to see which impact this had on their bank,\" Belgian financial sector lobby Febelfin spokesperson Isabelle Marchand said.\n\n\"This will be different for every bank, but the financial stability of every bank needs to be monitored closely.\"\n\nNoting that some institutions have raised rates or offered similar products since the bond sale, Van Peteghem said he hoped and expected bigger banks would now follow.\n\n\"If that's not happening that means that we still need to look for other tools. We can issue again another bond in December,\" he added.\n\nThe one-year maturity, shorter than Belgium's usual retail bonds, was designed to mirror savings accounts that increase the payout to savers if they lock up their money for a year.\n\nThe government has agreed a bill, pending approval, reducing the withholding tax buyers will pay to 15% to make the bond more attractive relative to savings accounts, from 30% on other Belgian retail bonds.\n\nMarchand said Febelfin had no problem with a tax-friendly bond, but added: \"the same conditions should apply to all similar investment products, and therefore there should be a level playing field.\"\n\nBelgium's debt agency said the vast size of the bond sale meant outstanding short-term debt would be reduced by more than 10 billion euros over the course of 2023, longer-debt issuance cut by over 2 billion euros and the cash reserve position increased by around 9 bln euros.","labels":["financial_success"]}

Egg production levels were down as much as 6% earlier this year, but started to show signs of improvement in April.\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, a contagious disease often fatal to birds, has affected 325 U.S. commercial poultry flocks over the past year, but only seven cases have been reported since March. No cases were reported in the past 30 days.\nDive Insight\n\nHPAI, often spread by migratory birds, affected more than 58 million commercial and wild birds in the past year, the country\u2019s worst outbreak on record, according to USDA data. As cases spread, supplies tightened and prices soared, especially for eggs.\n\nU.S. egg inventories were down 29% in December compared to the start of 2022. More than 43 million egg-laying hens died from disease or depopulation efforts last year. Wholesale egg prices surged 267% on increased holiday demand. They have since decreased as flocks are rebuilt and farmers adopt biosecurity measures as HPAI preventative.\n\n\n SUPPLY CHAIN DIVE: PROCUREMENT\n\nAfter last year\u2019s outbreak, Brian Earnest, lead economist, animal protein at CoBank, said he anticipated HPAI to be a year-round issue in 2023 with a lingering expectation that it would be back in full force, but \u201cthat does not seem to be the case.\u201d\n\nInstead, the rate of infection among domestic commercial poultry flocks has significantly weakened, according to USDA data.

Shoppers were paying on average $2.71 a dozen for large, grade A eggs this time last year.\n\nAs U.S. prices return to pre-pandemic levels, cases are cropping up in other parts of the world, including Chile and China, where human infections were reported in April.

{"text":"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russia kept one of its main gas supply routes to Europe shut on Saturday, stoking fears of winter fuel shortages and spotlighting differences between Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Germany's Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) over repair work on the pipeline.\n\nAlready struggling to tame soaring gas prices, European governments had expected the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to resume flows after a short maintenance this week but Russia abruptly cancelled the restart, citing an oil leak in a turbine.\n\nEurope has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in what Moscow has called an \"economic war\" with the West over the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions.\n\nThe latest Nord Stream shutdown, which Russia says will last for as long as it takes to carry out repairs, added to fears of winter gas shortages that could help tip major economies into recession and energy rationing.\n\nThe discovery of the oil leak on Friday coincided with the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies proceeding with plans to impose a price gap on Russian oil, intending to shrink President Vladimir Putin's resources to fight the war in Ukraine.\n\nGas shortages also prompted European Union member Sweden on Saturday to unveil a financial support package for energy firms.\n\n\"If we do not act, there is a serious risk of disruptions in the financial system, which in the worst case could lead to a financial crisis,\" said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.\n\n\"Putin wants to create division, but our message is clear: you will not succeed,\" she said.\n\nGAS PRICE RALLY EXPECTED\nGazprom said Siemens Energy was ready to carry out repairs on the pipeline but that there was nowhere available to carry out the work, a suggestion Siemens Energy denied, saying it had not been asked to do the job.\n\nSiemens Energy has also said that sanctions do not prohibit maintenance.\n\nBefore the latest round of maintenance, Gazprom had already cut flows to just 20% of the pipeline's capacity.\n\n\"Siemens is taking part in repair work in accordance with the current contract, is detecting malfunctions ... and is ready to fix the oil leaks. Only there is nowhere to do the repair,\" Gazprom said in a statement on its Telegram channel on Saturday.\n\nSiemens Energy said it had not been commissioned to carry out the work but was available, adding that the Gazprom-reported leak would not usually affect the operation of a turbine and could be sealed on site.\n\n\"Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several times that there are enough additional turbines available in the Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nFlows through Nord Stream 1 were due to resume early on Saturday morning. But hours before it was set to start pumping gas, Gazprom published a photo on Friday of what it said was an oil leak on a piece of equipment.\n\nSiemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment at Nord Stream 1's Portovaya compressor station said on Friday the leak did not constitute a technical reason to stop gas flows.\n\n\n\"Global natural gas prices will likely rally hard on Monday as markets readjust to this latest #Gazprom development,\" Tom Marzec-Manser, Head of Gas Analytics at ICIS, said on twitter.\n\n\"The closure of #NordStream1 reduces overall Russian pipeline flows yet further and will make balancing supply & demand this winter all the more difficult.\"\n\nAsked about the halt on Saturday, Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said that the European Union expects Russia to respect its agreed energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if Moscow fails to do so. read more\n\nThe German network regulator said that the country's gas supply was currently guaranteed but the situation was fragile and further deterioration could not be ruled out.\n\n\"The defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the halt of operations,\" it said.\n\nWholesale gas prices have rocketed more than 400% since August 2021, squeezing households already gripped by a cost-of-living crisis and forcing some energy hungry industries, such as fertiliser and aluminium makers, to scale back production.\n\nThe European Commission has said a full cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Europe, if combined with a cold winter, could reduce average EU gross domestic product by up to 1.5% if countries did not prepare in advance.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Irresponsible spending. Misjudging summer 2022's crypto market implosion. Getting locked out of its own cryptocurrency wallet. These are some of the missteps detailed in a court filing submitted by battered crypto custodian Prime Trust as it seeks bankruptcy protection. \n\nIn a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Thursday, Prime Trust CEO Jor Law explained how the company was battered by a combination of the collapsing cryptocurrency market and a management team that failed to change course amid the plunge. Instead, Law\u2014who became interim CEO last November\u2014said the company\u2019s previous leaders doubled down on spending at a time when revenues were strained.\n\n\nAccording to Law, Prime Trust spent about $10.5 million in October against revenues of about $3.1 million, giving it a net-loss of over $7 million. A month later, the spending rose again to $11.1 million, costing it another net loss of about $8.4 million.\n\nAmong the events that hit the company directly last year was the collapse of TerraLUNA last May after the failure of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin and LUNA governance token. Law said that Prime Trust put $6 million in client funds and $2 million from its own treasury into Terra before it failed. \n\nIn another egregious incident, the company detailed how it locked itself out of its own cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nUnder the subheading \"The Wallet Event,\" Low detailed how company executives used a \"cold storage wallet\" for holding onto tokens, including ETH and ERC-20 compliant coins. One wallet, described as a \"98f Wallet,\" was set up in March 2018 as a device that required physical posession as well multiple signatures to access.\n\n\nNevada Forces Crypto Custodian Prime Trust to Shut Down\nRegulators in Nevada are moving to shut down troubled cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust after determining that the firm was so financially underwater that it would not be able to service customers anymore.  On Tuesday, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division submitted a filing to the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas that called for a freeze on all Prime Trust\u2019s business activities. The regulator also called for the appointment of a receiver to manage the business in place of its...\n\nHowever, according to the filing, new management subsequently decided to resume deposits of Prime Trust\u2019s customer assets into legacy wallets, at which point those assets became unrecoverable. The firm only learned of the mistake when an unidentified customer requested a large ETH withdrawal that the company could not fulfill.\n\nPrime Trust soon learned that it no longer had the physical devices\u2014engraved Cryptosteel plates\u2014needed even to access the old wallet. Crypto analysis firm Arkham claims to have identified the wallet on the blockchain, estimating it holds over $45 million in assets today.\n\n\nAlthough assets held with Fireblocks technology were always accessible, Law said Prime Trust still has no access to the 98f wallet. As a workaround, Law said \u201ccertain company employees\" began using fiat currencies from its client accounts to purchase ETH and meet withdrawal requests from December 2021 to March 2022, using over $76 million to fund them. \n\n\nBitGo Cancels Prime Trust Acquisition, Users Report Frozen Withdrawals\nCryptocurrency custodian BitGo is pulling out of acquisition talks with rival Prime Trust, putting the short-lived deal to an end.  BitGo announced the decision to walk away in a tweet on Thursday. Without going into specifics, the company said the decision was \"not made lightly\", and that it was committed to business as usual.  \"After considerable effort and work to find a path forward with Prime Trust, BitGo has made the hard decision to terminate its acquisition of Prime Trust,\u201d read the twee...\n\nOn June 27, Nevada regulators moved to shut down Prime Trust after they learned the company owed massive debts in fiat and cryptocurrencies to clients. Officials said that Prime Trust owed more than $85 million in fiat with only about $2.9 million on hand. In terms of cryptocurrencies, Prime Trust owed about $69.5 million with a little over $68.6 million available to it at the time.\n\nAfter being initially placed into receivership, Prime Trust ultimately filed for bankruptcy on August 14.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corporate activism tastes different in China. Soft drink Pocari Sweat is caught in a firestorm after it pulled television ads in apparent support of Hong Kong protests. Such statements can pay off for brands that have political influence, or stand to win more friends than enemies. With Beijing involved, neither is usually the case.\n\nPocari, a sports drink owned by Otsuka Holdings, earned brownie points from protesters by ending a partnership with TVB when the channel was accused of a pro-Beijing bias - a charge the outlet denies. Little known outside Asia, the tangy drink is now a regular fixture at sweltering summer marches.\n\nBut the campaign has fallen flat. Such strategies are polarising; Pocari won fans in Hong Kong, but after a backlash from Chinese state media, the brand distanced itself from the earlier statements.\n\nCompanies globally are becoming bolder in taking principled stands. Take Nike - the shoemaker supported U.S. footballer Colin Kaepernick\u2019s fight against racism, making him the face of a marketing campaign last year. Media giants Netflix, Disney and WarnerMedia have threatened to stop working in the state of Georgia if strict abortion rules go ahead\n\n\nBut the conditions where this can work are pretty specific. In Nike\u2019s case, courting controversy was a way to charm consumers: a Reuters survey showed it sold 61% more merchandise in the ten days after it released the ads, compared with the ten days prior. In the United States, large companies with big investment budgets can actually hope to influence policy outcomes.\n\nThe maths is more difficult where China is concerned. Brands don\u2019t want to alienate the huge market, or anger a government that isn\u2019t afraid to meddle in business. Even Nike has opted to avoid any controversy. Earlier this year it abruptly abandoned plans to sell a limited-edition design in China \u2013 where it earned 14% of revenue last year - after its collaborator showed support for the Hong Kong protesters on social media.\n\nThis might also explain why Hong Kong\u2019s biggest conglomerates such as CK Hutchison and Swire Pacific have had little to say on the subject of the city\u2019s political turbulence. That could change if their earnings and share prices start to suffer. Even then, Hong Kong may end up proving the limits of companies\u2019 taste for political engagement.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"Little-known but powerful, Perenco styles itself as Europe\u2019s leading independent oil and gas group. It operates in 14 countries, including the largest onshore European oil farm, in England, and several gas rigs in the North Sea. \n\nThe multinational\u2019s success has benefited its owners above all: the Perrodo family, France\u2019s 15th wealthiest with homes in London\u2019s most exclusive neighbourhoods. The billionaires, who gave their name to their company (Perrodo Energy Company), feathered their nest far from media spotlight and public scrutiny. \n\nOne of the reasons behind their discreet ascent is that Perenco is not listed on the stock market. As a result, the group is free from transparency rules that affect its main competitors. And with fewer than 10,000 employees worldwide, it is not subject to French laws requiring companies to list the risks associated with their activities abroad.\nAll this makes attempts to scrutinise the company\u2019s operations particularly difficult. Yet, Perenco\u2019s business is worth looking into: it specialises in buying up mature assets that other oil majors are trying to get rid of due to aging facilities and ebbing reserves. \n\nPerenco has been embroiled in various environmental and human rights scandals in several countries where it is present. Accused of funding paramilitary groups in Colombia and linked to the displacement of indigenous communities in Guatemala, the firm has also faced a litany of land pollution and water contamination allegation across Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn its race to become Europe\u2019s leading private oil company, Perenco has relied on radical methods, sometimes cutting corners at the expense of the environment. \n\n\u201cIt is certain that compared to the standards of Total or big American companies, Perenco are not on the same level,\u201d  a former Perenco executive in Africa told IE and Disclose. The group, he added, questions environmental norms \u201cthat they consider incompatible with their model.\u201d\n\nThis model has led to scores of alleged incidents at Perenco sites over the years. Dumping of toxic sludge, oil leaks due to aging facilities and air pollution are common occurrences in countries where Perenco has subsidiaries, according to reports by NGOs, authorities and journalists.\n\n\nIn Gabon, 50,000 cubic metres of oil leaked from some of the group\u2019s tanks last April. In the town of Muanda, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the company is burning gas day and night near homes, crops and drinking water sources. On the other side of the Atlantic, in Peru, the multinational has taken the government to court in an attempt to block the creation of a nature reserve in its operating area.\n\nWhen questioned by IE and Disclose, the company said: \u201cPerenco acts as a responsible partner. In each country where it operates, Perenco is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees and communities.\u201d \n\nHowever, the group \u201crecognises that incidents relating to our activities have occurred in the past\u201d, but declined to comment on the ongoing legal process in Gabon. A spokesperson added that a significant investment had been made in DRC to reduce flaring, and that the company was working closely with local communities in Peru.\n\nHubert the \u201cconqueror\u201d\nPerenco\u2019s origins can be traced back to tax havens. In 1967, Hubert Perrodo, the group\u2019s founder, who hails from a fisherman\u2019s family on the west coast of France, was working for an American oil tycoon in the Bahamas. \u201cIf you want to make a fortune, kid, you have to get into oil!\u201d his then boss is said to have told him. \n\nIn 1971, Perrodo moved to Singapore. The \u201cconqueror\u201d, as he is described on Perenco\u2019s website, worked in the fossil fuel industry and met his wife, with whom he had three children. In the 1970s, he created a shipping company and set up a drilling business, before establishing Perenco in 1992. Following Perrodo\u2019s death in a mountaineering accident in 2006, his eldest son, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, took the reins of the family empire. A car racing enthusiast, he has followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to expand the business, which he owns with his siblings and mother. Today, in addition to their oil company, the Perrodos own a number of famous French wine estates and, more surprisingly, are the majority owners of Konbini, a popular online news outlet. \n\nSecret financial architecture \nIf Perenco\u2019s motto proudly states that \u201coil remains an adventure\u201d, the Perrodos have become masters of a completely different trade: the creation of opaque corporate structures. While Perenco\u2019s headquarters are located in affluent parts of London and Paris, the group is made of a myriad of companies registered in tax havens. \n\nIn the Bahamas alone, the multinational was relying on 62 holdings as of 2016. IE\u2019s analysis of oil contracts and public registries around the world shows that these holdings have been used to set up subsidiaries in countries where Perenco has activities, while keeping ownership and cash flows shrouded in secrecy. \n\nTo set up this complex financial scheme, the Perrodos were helped by a handful of trusted men. Among them is the father of France\u2019s energy transition minister, Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher. By Hubert Perrodo\u2019s side from the start, Jean-Michel Runacher has remained one of the group\u2019s key figures to this day. Previously chief financial officer, CEO and administrator, he\u2019s still at the helm of some of the group\u2019s companies. \n\n\nCredit: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Barande \/\u00c9cole polytechnique Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay\/Creative Commons\nAccording to IE and Disclose\u2019s investigation, part of the wealth he amassed during his career was discreetly passed on to the minor children of Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher. More than one million euros of assets in hedge funds that have also counted Perenco as a client. Questioned on the scheme, the energy transition minister said she didn\u2019t have to declare this sum to the French government watchdog and denied any wrongdoing.\n\n#PerencoFiles is an ongoing investigation supported by the IJ4EU Investigation Support Scheme.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"Embattled US fashion company Gap has reported an 8 per cent decline in second-quarter sales to $3.55 billion as its market share continues to erode. \n\nOver the past two years, Gap\u2019s sales are down by 15.7 per cent according to figures from GlobalData MD Neil Saunders. \n\n\u201cWhile the apparel market has been challenged, this is a far worse performance than average and represents a significant erosion of market share,\u201d he said. \n\n\nComp-store sales were down 6 per cent for the quarter and online turnover fell by 11 per cent.\n\nThe company\u2019s operating income was just $106 million, resulting in an operating margin of 3 per cent. Its adjusted net income of $127 million excluded restructuring costs.\n\nDescribing the results as \u201cfar from good\u201d Saunders said new CEO Richard Dickson, who started the role this week, faces something of a mountain to climb in terms of rebuilding the business given \u201cthe dire state of the company and its various brands\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis initial sentiments, stressing the need to do things differently and to redefine the brands so that they have meaning to consumers, are very sensible. We only hope that the usual inertia of Gap doesn\u2019t grow like weeds over his ambitions.\u201d\n\nEvery Gap brand firmly in decline\nAll of Gap\u2019s brands are now firmly in decline, including the recent star performer Athleta, which saw sales dip by 2.4 per cent year on year. \n\nThe group\u2019s lead namesake brand Gap saw sales plunge 14 per cent to $755 million, however a large part of this was due to the sale of the Gap China business, the closure of Yeezy Gap and the negative impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding all that, sales were down by a net 4 per cent, the company said. \n\nOld Navy also met headwinds with net sales down by 6 per cent to to $1.96 billion, and Banana Republic fell by 11 per cent to $480 million. \n\n\u201cWhile Banana Republic maintained market share in the quarter, sales growth remains impacted in the short-term as the brand laps the outsized growth last year driven by the shift in consumer preferences,\u201d Gap said.\n\nThe company put a positive spin on its predicament with executive VP and CFO Katrina O\u2019Connell saying the group was focused on the long term, its focus on \u201cunlocking the value of our important and iconic brands coupled with the transformative actions we are taking to improve our operating structure\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Dickson, who is also president, said there were \u201cencouraging signs of progress\u201d as the company\u2019s teams streamline the way they work to enable a focus on growth-driving initiatives \u2013 \u201ca virtuous cycle that we\u2019ll look to become our norm\u201d. \n\n\u201cThis means we have to do things differently, with a clear focus on redefining our brands\u2019 meaning to consumers, focusing on creativity, designing for relevance as a pursuit rather than a goal, and leveraging our remarkable legacy to shape an exciting new future,\u201d he said.\n\nNevertheless, Gap is predicting a decline in third-quarter sales as well \u2013 \u201cin the low double-digit range compared to last year\u2019s net sales of $4.04 billion\u201d. \n\nThe company said a significant factor in Gap\u2019s recent decline was the group\u2019s sale of its China business to online group Baozun, which closed on January 31, with third-quarter FY22 sales by Gap China running to about $70 million. \n\n\u201cThe company anticipates that fiscal 2023 net sales could decrease in the mid-single digit range compared to last year\u2019s net sales of $15.6 billion. As a reminder, fiscal 2022 net sales included approximately $300 million in sales for Gap China.\u201d But adding a 53rd week into FY23\u2019s figures will boost sales by $150 million, the company said. \n\nSaunders did note that after a loss of $49 million in the same quarter last year, a $117 million profit was a positive step. \u201cBetter inventory management resulting in fewer markdowns and lower freight costs were helpful to the number. \n\n\u201cHowever, aside from this small comfort, Gap isn\u2019t in a good place. It means the new CEO will have a baptism of fire as he starts the long hard slog of trying to restore a once iconic company to its former glory.\u201d\n\nBoring, lacklustre assortments\nBy brand, Saunders said Old Navy was challenged by its core family shopper being under a significant amount of financial pressure and cutting back on spending as a result \u2013 \u201cbut to nowhere near this degree\u201d. \n\n\u201cThat means that part of Old Navy\u2019s problem is that its shoppers are defecting to buy apparel elsewhere. While some of this is the result of people seeking out lower-priced alternatives, some is also a consequence of boring ranges and styles at Old Navy. In our view, the brand has lost its edge and is churning out more of the same season after season, rather than being led by trends. This, combined with a more cautious consumer, is a losing combination.\u201d\n\nHe said selective store closures had not helped the Gap brand, where sales fell 4.1 per cent in the US market and described the product assortment as \u201clacklustre\u201d. \n\n\u201cLike Old Navy, Gap is incredibly boring and does very little to entice customers into buying its products \u2013 especially not at the high full prices it charges, hence why it so often resorts to discounting to shift stock,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe Gap brand has long been the problem child of the group, and its relevance in the market is one of the biggest issues new management will need to tackle if they want to turn around the fortunes of the company.\u201d\n\nHe had some sympathy for Banana Republic, however, noting a \u201cgenuine effort\u201d made to enhance the experience, products, and the wider proposition at Banana. \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some initial effort has not been maintained and this, along with a softer market which is less interested in smart-casual, has put an abrupt end to growth.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress"]}

Now, the shutdown of a major US freight trucking giant is the latest sign of the shipping sector\u2019s long-haul troubles.\n\nYellow, a 99-year-old trucking company based in Nashville, Tennessee, filed for bankruptcy this week, just a few years after it received a $700 million government loan through the pandemic-relief CARES Act under President Trump, and months into heated contract negotiations with the Teamsters, the union representing the majority of Yellow\u2019s workforce. The bankruptcy has inflamed a blame game around why the once-thriving trucking company buckled, with some politicians finding fault with government bailouts that merely delay the inevitable doom for struggling companies, and others \u2014 including Yellow \u2014 pointing the finger at organized labor.\n\nYellow\u2019s downfall raises many questions about what it means for its 30,000 employees, for taxpayers, and for consumers who have already watched the price of everyday items climb amid supply chain disruptions. Sorting out its assets and dealing with freight that remains to be delivered will take some time, resulting in tie-ups. Some supply chain clients expected this and had already left for more expensive competitors \u2014 meaning consumer prices could rise.\n\nWhile the closure of one shipping industry leader doesn\u2019t mean the average consumer is suddenly going to see emptier store shelves, Yellow\u2019s bankruptcy is a sign that the industry\u2019s woes aren\u2019t going away anytime soon: It\u2019s a hyper-competitive landscape with high operational costs, including expensive fuel and pay for an army of human drivers. Trucking needs a hefty workforce to avoid disruptions to its always-on-the-move business, yet for years it has been beleaguered by a driver shortage.\n\nWith Yellow\u2019s shuttering, consumers could eventually see the ripple effects in what it costs to buy items and have them delivered \u2014 even more than they already have \u2014 as the push-and-pull between freight companies trying to turn a profit and workers asking to be paid adequately for their labor plays out again and again.\n\nYellow\u2019s fraught freight history\nYellow, which was formerly known as YRC Freight, was one of the largest \u201cless-than-load\u201d (LTL) transport companies in the US. These are businesses that deliver smaller quantities of freight, somewhere between full-trailer truckloads and individual parcel shipping (like the kind that carries your Amazon package). Yellow made up about 9 percent of the LTL market, according to the industry publication FreightWaves. It was the third-largest LTL company in the nation \u2014 other top LTL shippers include FedEx Freight, XPO, and Old Dominion Freight Line \u2014 delivering industrial, commercial, and retail goods across a wide range of sectors, including the defense and aerospace industries, automotive manufacturers, oil and gas companies, and health care, according to its website.\n\n\nIts size and history is partly why its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is big news \u2014 yet the bankruptcy may not have come as a surprise to anyone who\u2019s been watching the logistics industry, or Yellow specifically, over the past decade and a half. The company made a few expensive acquisitions in the early 2000s; then the 2008 financial crisis hit and customers fled, and it reported a net loss of nearly $1 billion that year. Yellow almost filed for bankruptcy the following year, avoiding it only after its employees took pay cuts. It considered bankruptcy again in 2014 and in 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t too many companies out there that have got a 99-year history and 30,000 workers,\u201d says Ryan Patel, a senior fellow at the Claremont Graduate University\u2019s Drucker School of Management with expertise in challenges facing the global supply chain. \u201cThat less-than-truckload concept was what they were initially the leaders of, but over time, there were a lot more players coming into it.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, particularly during union contract negotiations, there were signs that Yellow was on the verge of buckling again. Its creditors number over 100,000 and include the likes of Amazon, according to a New York Times report. It failed to make recent payments into the employee pension fund, owing about $50 million \u2014 which almost resulted in a strike, before the union agreed to give the company more time to make the payments. The looming strike set off alarm bells, and Yellow\u2019s delivery volume fell 80 percent as customers fled. Then, last week, the Teamsters were notified that the company would be shutting down.\n\nMuch of the public discussion around Yellow\u2019s shutdown has centered not on the bankruptcy itself, but on the $700 million loan the federal government handed it in 2020 \u2014 a bailout that has drawn scrutiny for years. A recent Congressional Oversight Commission report found that Yellow didn\u2019t qualify for the CARES Act loan as a company vital to US national security interests, as the legislation stated \u2014 Yellow often delivered to military bases around the country, but the congressional committee\u2019s final report determined that other freight trucking companies could have provided those delivery services. In fact, almost all of the money set aside in the CARES Act for businesses important to \u201cnational security\u201d went to Yellow. It also should have been ineligible because it was already in poor financial condition prior to the pandemic.\n\n\nAt the time of the bankruptcy filing, it had repaid just $230 of the loan\u2019s principal. The loan came with a low interest rate in exchange for a near 30 percent equity stake for the US Treasury. Yellow says it intends to repay the CARES Act loan in full.\n\nHow Yellow\u2019s labor disputes escalated\nDespite the lifelines it had been thrown, Yellow remained in grim financial straits. As debt mounted and Yellow became increasingly cash-strapped, labor negotiations grew tense. About 22,000 of its 30,000 total workforce are union members. In recent months, the company began bargaining for its next contract, with the current one set to expire in March 2024, but the two sides stood far apart on key issues, including an $11-per-hour pay increase over the next five years, pension fund payments, and some operational changes at the company.\n\nIn June, Yellow filed a lawsuit against the union for blocking the restructure of the company, claiming that its obstruction had cost the company $137 million. The Teamsters denied the claim. \u201cAfter decades of gross mismanagement, Yellow blew through a $700 million bailout from the federal government, and now it wants workers to foot the bill,\u201d Teamsters general president Sean O\u2019Brien said in a statement. The union, for its part, has sued Yellow, alleging it failed to provide the required notice for mass layoffs.\n\nYellow CEO Darren Hawkins, whom the company paid a total of $1.27 million last year according to public filings, was also quick to blame the Teamsters during the bankruptcy announcement, saying in a statement that \u201call workers and employers should take note of our experience\u201d with the Teamsters and \u201cworry.\u201d \u201cA company has the right to manage its own operations, but as we have experienced, [union] leadership was able to halt our business plan, literally driving our company out of business, despite every effort to work with them,\u201d he continued.\n\nLabor has long been a major presence in the logistics industry \u2014 there are about 340,000 union UPS workers, for example \u2014 but unionized drivers and dock workers have become less common since the deregulation of the trucking industry in the 1980s. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more competition now,\u201d says Patel \u2014 competition that often uses cheaper, non-union labor. Yellow, like many others in the sector, had failed to be \u201cnimble,\u201d Patel adds. \u201cTime has caught up with this company, and the financials have caught up with this company.\u201d","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"The rise of gold mining in Sudan, which has become Africa\u2019s third largest producer of the precious mineral over the last decade, has gone hand in hand with the growth of poverty in a country that ranks 172nd in the United Nations Human Development Index (out of a total of 191 nations). While Sudanese authorities announced in January that a record production had been achieved in 2022, the World Bank\u2019s economic indicators pointed to a very different mark for this country located in the Horn of Africa: the percentage of the population below the poverty threshold had risen steadily from 15.3% in 2014 to 32.9% in 2022. That is to say, right now around 15 million people are living on less than $2.15 (\u20ac1.96) a day.\n\nAlthough the gold industry does not explain by itself the impoverishment of Sudan, the battle over its control is fueling the current conflict between the Sudanese army and the main paramilitary organization, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), for whom gold has become one of its main sources of funding. At least 604 people have died and another 5,127 have been injured since a fresh confrontation broke out on April 15, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\nNo one knows exactly how much gold is being extracted in Sudan. The industry began to gain traction following the secession of South Sudan in 2011, as a way to compensate for the two-thirds of oil wells that Khartoum lost with the independence of the south of the territory. Although available figures are confusing, they do offer a dimension of the mineral\u2019s economic potential. In January, the director of the General Administration for the Supervision and Control of Production Companies, Alaeldin Ali, stated at a media conference that the country had achieved a new extraction record, having exceeded its best production by one ton and 611 kilograms. The previous record was set in 2017 with 107 tons. In other words, last year\u2019s extraction would have been around 109 tons, according to these official calculations. The Sudanese Resources Company announced in April that the export of gold, to the tune of around 41.8 tons, had brought in revenue of about $2 billion (\u20ac1.8 billion) in 2022.\n\nNone of these figures include the gold that gets smuggled out of the country. \u201cThe Central Bank of Sudan has recognized that [mineral] smuggling is a major problem in the country,\u201d says Denise Sprimont-Vasquez, an analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS). This expert points to the gold extraction companies controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, Hemedti, as one of the actors responsible for this looting. The other faction, the national army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, exploits other economic sectors of the country. And then there is the Wagner Group, a shady organization of Russian mercenaries with ties to the Kremlin, whom the United States and the European Union accuse of exploiting Sudanese gold through shell companies. In January of this year, it was revealed that three Russian citizens had been arrested for smuggling gold out of Sudan, recalls Sprimont-Vasquez.\n\nNor does the Sudanese state have the capacity to account for the gold extracted through artisanal mining methods, which according to the C4ADS analyst represents 85% of the country\u2019s total. \u201cAs this activity is mainly informal, it is unlikely that it will be covered by official statistics,\u201d she adds.\n\nSudan\nTwo men pan for gold in Sudan, near Khartoum.\nERIC LAFFORGUE\nThe 2021 coup, which ended the transitional government and gave way to the military executive of Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, increased opacity in the gold sector, says Joseph Siegle, research director at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. During the brief period that Sudan\u2019s transitional government lasted (from the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 to October 2021), an audit by the civilian-led Ministry of Finance revealed that most revenues from gold were not declared. \u201cIn 2021 alone, at least 32 tons of gold went unaccounted for, according to state inspections, which is a minimum of $1.9 billion,\u201d Siegle explains. The figure was advanced by CNN in a 2022 investigation. \u201cThe estimate that was made is that in 2021 the real production of gold might have reached 233 tons, a figure much higher than what is reflected in the official data,\u201d adds Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Luengo, an expert in sub-Saharan African resources and a member of the African Studies Group at Madrid\u2019s Autonomous University.\n\nGold as a weapon of war\nGold is financing part of the conflict. \u201cIt provides Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo with a deep, government-independent war chest to finance his conflict, even though the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by al-Burhan, also control many companies and economic sectors in the country,\u201d Siegle stresses. Dagalo, according to this analyst, has become one of the richest men in the country, among other things due to his control of the gold sector, in addition to livestock and infrastructure, in the western region of Darfur.\n\nThis control of resources by military actors is, says Siegle, an important factor in the current conflict and one of the reasons that keep the country in a critical economic situation. \u201cIf the armed forces had to submit to a civilian government, as required by the framework agreement that governed the transition to democracy, then these resources would enter the government treasury, contributing significantly to the economic recovery and stabilization of the country.\u201d\n\nGold extracted from Sudan is believed to have helped stabilize the Russian economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent international sanctions\nResearch director at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies\nBut Moscow also benefits from this state of affairs. \u201cWagner, under Yevgeny Prigozhin [known as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s chef] has become very active in the Sudanese gold sector, including in close collaboration with Hemedti,\u201d Siegle explains. According to this expert, it was precisely the arrival of the Wagner Group, whose presence in Sudan Prigozhin has denied, that has raised part of Sudan\u2019s artisanal mining to a commercial scale. \u201cThis would explain the record levels of extraction; gold extracted from Sudan is believed to have helped stabilize the Russian economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent international sanctions [against Moscow],\u201d he stresses. According to a CNN investigation published last July and based on information from official Sudanese sources, between February and July of last year at least 16 flights left Sudan for Russia loaded with smuggled gold.\n\nWhile paramilitary and foreign actors share the exploitation of gold, those 233 tons that are estimated to have been extracted in 2021 would have meant revenues of more than $13 billion [\u20ac11.7 billion], notes Garc\u00eda Luengo. \u201cThis income would be fundamental in a country where the population suffers from severe deprivations, with low Human Development Index indicators and an immense need for basic social services.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the scant control over gold mining not only perpetuates poverty, but also represents a major environmental and public health problem. Artisanal miners often use mercury, which is cheaper than other substances, to separate gold from other minerals. During the process, the extracted amalgam is heated, as mercury evaporates before the gold melts. However, it is odorless and highly toxic, so it is easily inhaled by workers, in addition to contaminating land and water.\n\nTo measure the impact of this pollution, Garc\u00eda Luengo recalls that some two million people work in Sudan\u2019s artisanal mining industry, including children (the country\u2019s population is more than 45 million people). \u201cThey work without adequate protection,\u201d he laments, so that the gold business not only impoverishes them and generates violence, but also makes them sick.\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"Consumer spending held up well in July as inflation slowed, with retail sales turning in a stronger-than-expected showing for the month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.\n\nThe advanced retail sales report showed a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.7% for the month, better than the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding autos, sales rose a robust 1%, also against a 0.4% forecast. Both readings were the best monthly gains since January.\n\nAs the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, they showed a consumer able to keep ahead of price increases that have been prevalent over the past two years. The consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month, indicating solid demand.\n\nJuly\u2019s numbers were boosted by a 1.9% jump in spending at online retailers, while sporting goods and related stores increased 1.5% and food service and drinking places rose 1.4%.\n\nOn the downside, furniture sales slumped 1.8% and electronics and appliance stores reported a 1.3% drop. Gas station sales rose just 0.4% on the month despite rising prices at the pump.\n\nThe report adds to the narrative that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a much-predicted recession brought on by a series of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation.\n\nIn a series of 11 increases since March 2022, the central bank has taken up its key borrowing rate by 5.25 percentage points to hits highest level in more than 22 years. Regardless, consumers, who power about two-thirds of the entire $26.8 trillion U.S. economy, have persevered.\n\n\u201cDespite the additional pressure put on the Fed, Americans\u2019 sustained ability to spend speaks to the strength of the US economy in the face of global economic challenges,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at the Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.\n\nAs saving has begun to dry up, shoppers have shown a willingness to use credit cards, the balances of which exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nJuly\u2019s data showed that spending was widespread, with most categories showing increases. However, motor vehicle sales fell 0.3% as well. On a 12-month basis, sales rose 3.2%, which is exactly in line with the annual increase in the CPI.\n\nA separate report Tuesday, however, showed that inflation pressures linger after hitting their highest level in more than 40 years in the summer of 2022.\n\nImport prices moved 0.4% higher in July, higher than the 0.2% estimate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was only the second monthly gain in 2023, as the year-over-year rate declined 4.4%. A year ago, the annual increase was 8.8%.\n\nVirtually all of the increase came from a 3.6% rise in imported fuel prices. Import prices were unchanged when excluding fuel, according to the BLS.\n\nExport prices, though, rose even more, gaining 0.7% on the month. However, they are down 7.9% from a year ago, after surging 12.9% from July 2021 to July 2022.\n\n\u201cConsumers spent with vigor in July, perhaps with a sense of relief that inflation is fading even in the absence of recession or extensive job losses,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \u201cIs a soft landing still on the table? It\u2019s certainly possible, but it seems a stretch to conclude that it\u2019s probable.\u201d\n\nAn additional report Tuesday presented another mixed bag of data.\n\nThe Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which gauges activity in the New York region, slumped 20 points in August to a reading of -19. That represents the difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction, and was much lower than the -1.4 Dow Jones estimate.\n\nNew orders and shipments dropped sharply on the month, while prices paid and received both moved considerably higher.\n\nDespite the poor August reading, the index for future business conditions, which measures expectations six months out, increased to 19.9, a move up of 6 points. That came as new orders and shipments, the big drag in the current conditions survey, to \u201cincrease significantly,\u201d while employment is \u201cexpected to grow considerably.\u201d\n\nCapital spending expectations also rose sharply.","labels":["financial_success"]}
{"text":"As the world embarks on a new wave of technological revolution, digital technology has cemented its significant role in future development. Emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things are being integrated further into industries and society, driving the digital transformation forward. As estimated by the World Economic Forum, 60 percent of global GDP will be digitized by 2022. A study by the Harvard Business Review identified that nearly 72 percent of companies are investing in digital transformation, up from 62 percent in 2020. Digital technology is widely recognized for its capacity to stimulate the global economy.\n\nWithin China, tech companies have been a significant contributor to the economy and social progress in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese companies utilized a variety of technologies to address the public health emergency. According to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology\u2019s data brief, titled \u201cChina\u2019s Use of AI in its COVID-19 Response,\u201d companies of all sizes in AI-related industries in China developed and modified AI systems for pandemic control and prevention.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (JD) deployed self-driving robots in Wuhan to deliver supplies to hospitals treating coronavirus patients. This helped reduce human contact and keep society functioning. Thanks to an AI algorithm developed by the Alibaba DAMO Academy, genetic analyses of possible cases were able to detect virus mutations with a high degree of accuracy. Previously, this process took several hours, but with the help of this algorithm, the time was reduced to half an hour.\n\nIn December 2022, amid the rapid spread of COVID-19 and medication shortages, Tencent launched the \u201cCOVID-19 Protection Drugs Public Welfare and Mutual Aid Platform\u201d mini program to address the rising demand for analgesics and antipyretics. Those in need of medications can submit their information online, making resources readily available to those with dire needs.\n\nGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nAs the world enters the post-pandemic era, China is seeing shifts in policies. During the annual Central Economic Work Conference held in Beijing on December 15 and 16, the committee collectively agreed that the nation\u2019s economic performance is expected to improve next year. China will continue to support technological innovation, green development, and private enterprise, highlighting their central role in reviving the economy, stabilizing employment, and expanding international cooperation.\n\nEnjoying this article?

First, they are digitizing traditional sectors, especially labor-intensive industries, in order to optimize their performances. While China has a relatively solid industrial base, there is still a significant need to introduce digital technology into many traditional industries.\n\nSome Chinese tech giants have started empowering partners in the construction, agriculture, and machinery industries. Tencent Games and Tencent Cloud, in collaboration with Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., created an \u201cImmersive Convergence Digital Factory\u201d using real-time cloud rendering, virtual-reality combination, AR\/VR interaction, and other game technologies. This is the first time that Tencent Games applied its technology to the steel sector, raising standards for remote maintenance, production line operation, and production risk control.\n\nIFlytek is able to diagnose crop diseases and predict the farming environment of crops by utilizing technologies such as speech recognition, image recognition, and big data analysis. It created a platform for intelligent agriculture that lets farmers use digital planting and breeding on a fine scale.\n\nSecond, Chinese tech companies are leveraging digital productivity to upgrade industries across sectors in the real economy. Since the real economy will be China\u2019s focus in pursuing economic growth, the convergence of technology and the real economy will become a rising trend to watch.\n\nThe financial sector serves as a vital component alongside the real economy. Huawei provides robust financial infrastructure, constructs an intelligent architecture, and supports business innovation via its trusted networks, cloud, and databases in order to unleash the digital value of the finance industry. With cloud computing services, financial businesses are able to buy, sell, or distribute a variety of software and digital resources as an on-demand service on the internet, like electricity from a power grid.\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) has ranked Huawei Cloud as the market leader in China\u2019s financial cloud infrastructure in 2021. Meanwhile, Huawei Cloud Stack has ranked first on China\u2019s self-built financial cloud infrastructure market for four years running. This demonstrates Huawei\u2019s major influence in the digital transformation of China\u2019s financial sector.\n\nThe manufacturing sector serves as the backbone of the real economy, fostering economic growth. Tencent WeMake, an industrial internet platform, enables enterprises to build data-driven intelligent factories by modularizing and platformizing the industrial internet of things, cloud-native technology, and digital twins in order to intelligently transform manufacturing production and operations. It enhances the decision-making ability and operational efficiency of manufacturing enterprises.\n\nAccording to Tencent\u2019s Q4 2021 financial report, the revenue from fintech and ToB (business-to-business) services exceeded that from games for the first time, with ToB services as the tech giant\u2019s largest revenue contributor. Tencent\u2019s ToB arm, which empowers the real economy with digital technology, has already become a new profit-generating engine.\n\nChinese technology is taking a unique path that will have implications for both China and the rest of the world. Domestically, the rapid technological development and digital transformation of industries will contribute to China\u2019s economic growth with an increase in employment and wealth. Globally, various nations might look to China for lessons on digital transformation when they try to develop new technological products and services.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Train drivers are to stage a fresh strike in their long-running dispute over pay, threatening more travel chaos for passengers.\n\nThe action by members of the Aslef union will take place on 1 September. They will be subject to an overtime ban on 2 September, the same day as a strike by other rail staff.\n\nThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers announced a week ago that 20,000 of its members employed across 14 train operators would strike on 26 August and 2 September as part of their own dispute.\n\nAslef said its strike would force train companies across England to cancel all services, while the ban on overtime would \u201cseriously disrupt\u201d the network.\n\nThe union maintains that none of the privatised train-operating companies employs enough drivers to provide a proper service without employees working on their days off.\n\n\nThe companies that will be affected by the industrial action are Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; c2c; CrossCountry; East Midlands Railway; Greater Anglia; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Great Western Railway; Island Line; LNER; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern\/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains.\n\nThe strikes are likely to mean trains start later and finish much earlier than usual, with only about half of services in some areas, while other parts of the country will have fewer or no services at all.\n\nEvening services on some lines are likely to be affected on the days before each strike and on the mornings afterwards.\n\nMick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take this action but the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, have forced us into this place because they refuse to sit down and talk to us and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years \u2013 since 2019 \u2013 while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%.\n\n\u201cThe government appears happy to let passengers \u2013 and businesses \u2013 suffer in the mistaken belief that they can bully us into submission. They don\u2019t care about passengers, or Britain\u2019s railway, but they will not break us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTrain drivers at these companies have not had a pay rise for four years, since 2019, while inflation has rocketed, We haven\u2019t heard a word from the employers \u2013 we haven\u2019t had a meeting, a phone call, a text message, or an email \u2013 since 26 April and we haven\u2019t had any contact with the government since 6 January.\u201d\n\n\nIt will be the 12th one-day strike by Aslef members since the dispute started more than a year ago. A series of overtime bans by drivers have caused disruption on the rail network over the summer, including from 3 July to 8 July, from 31 July to 5 August and from 7 to 12 August.\nWhelan warned of further industrial action if the deadlocked row continued, saying Aslef members were pressing the union to go \u201charder and faster\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: \u201cFurther strike action by the Aslef leadership is unnecessary and will cause more disruption to passengers looking to enjoy various sporting events and the end of the summer holidays.\n\n\u201cThe union leadership has its head in the sand and refuses to put our fair and reasonable offer to their members. The offer would increase the average driver base salary for a four-day week without overtime from \u00a360,000 to nearly \u00a365,000 by the end of 2023.\n\n\u201cWe want to give our staff a pay increase, but it has always been linked to implementing necessary, sensible reforms that would enhance services for our customers.

{"text":"NEW YORK\/LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates further to ensure inflation is contained, chair Jerome Powell said on Friday, in remarks that balanced declines in the pace of price increases over the past year with the surprising overperformance of the U.S. economy.\n\n\"It is the Fed's job to bring inflation down to our 2% goal, and we will do so,\" Powell said.\n\nMARKET REACTION:\n\nSTOCKS: The S&P 500 (.SPX) edged up 0.1%, Nasdaq was flat and the Dow was up 0.4%.\n\nTREASURIES: The U.S. Treasury 2-year yield US2YT=RR was up 5 basis points at 5.067%\n\nFOREX: The U.S. dollar was up 0.3%\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nJASON ENGLAND, GLOBAL BONDS PORTFOLIO MANAGER, JANUS HENDERSON INVESTORS, CALIFORNIA\n\u201cAfter a Volkeresque hawkish speech at last year\u2019s Jackson Hole Symposium the tone was less stern this year, but still had a hawkish tilt to it as the job is not done on inflation and it is too early to declare victory.\"\n\n\"Restrictive monetary policy is needed to achieve progress and it is the Fed\u2019s intent to hold it there until they are confident inflation is moving sustainably down to their 2% target. He also made it clear that 2% is and will remain their target silencing any chatter from economists to increase the target.\"\n\nROSS MAYFIELD, INVESTMENT STRATEGY ANALYST, BAIRD, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY\n\"I thought the speech was hawkish, as Powell reiterated pretty explicitly that they view inflation risk is to the upside, and that they wanted to keep policy restrictive, you know, for a longer period of time to get inflation under control. It wasn\u2019t anything new, but it definitely didn\u2019t signal any easing or thoughts about easing.\"\n\nDAVID SADKIN, PRESIDENT, BEL AIR INVESTMENT ADVISORS, CALIFORNIA\n\"There was a little something for everybody. If you're a bear, you heard him say we're going to be restrictive, and we might hike rates and there's still a lot of work to do. If you're a bull, you heard him say, we're making progress against inflation and we still expect there to be a lag in from the effects of monetary policy, and we could be on hold.\"\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nReport this ad\n\"So people heard what they wanted to hear, but for the most part investors are comfortable, especially after this sell off in August that they're positioned for not so much for the next couple of months.\"\n\nRYAN DETRICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CARSON GROUP, OMAHA\n\u201c(Chairman Powell) didn\u2019t appear to rock the boat very much, but did show concern the economy is heating up, potentially opening the door for more hikes or leaving rates higher for longer.\u201d\n\n\"That does run counter to the recently released Fed minutes, which discussed a potentially weakening economy. But overall, at last year\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting he surprised by coming off more hawkish than expected. And this year that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. He kind of hit the ball down the middle of the fairway.\u201d\n\nROHAN KHANNA, HEAD, EURO RATES STRATEGY, BARCLAYS, LONDON \"It's tough to rationalize the move (in bond markets). The speech is very balanced but clearly points to the risk of doing more rather than doing nothing at all. It's not about when do we start easing but whether we need to do more. So, the fixed income selloff reflects that.\"\n\nMICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON\n\u201cPowell continues to walk a tightrope. Unlike last year, where he really wanted to emphasize the Fed\u2019s inflation-fighting credibility, this year I think he is demonstrating that he is pleased with how far monetary policy has come and how inflation has been reduced. But he is still holding on tightly to this notion that they are watching it carefully and they still have work to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think that the market continues to underestimate the potential for at least one if not two more rate hikes should inflation remain above the Fed\u2019s target. Even this morning during the speech, he emphatically said 2% is and will remain our target. And as a result, until we get closer to those levels the Fed is likely more hawkish than dovish.\u201d\n\nBRIAN MULBERRY, CLIENT PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ZACKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO\n\n\"Early in Chair Powell's comments, he has described the difference clearly between short term declines in core PCE and the 12 month change, the longer term price comparisons show that restrictive monetary policy is still needed to bring sustained progress on overall prices. This is already weighing on markets as the slightly hawkish comments are showing that rates are likely to go higher and stay there for longer than markets have currently priced in.\"\n\nVIRAJ PATEL, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, VANDA RESEARCH, LONDON\n\"The fact that he said policy is well above most neutral estimates is not what the bond market has been pricing in recent weeks. So that's a disappointment for bond bears. He kept absolutely every possible option on the table by saying nothing new.\"\n\nJUAN PEREZ, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, MONEX, WASHINGTON\n\u201cMarkets are being provided little in terms of clear guidance because not even Fed officials can see clearly what difficulties may arise in the future.\u201d\n\nThe opening dinner of the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell walks into the opening dinner of the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, U.S., August 24, 2023. REUTERS\/Ann Saphir Acquire Licensing Rights\n\n\u201cIn the midst of an expanding American economy, Powell has to say that all moves will be very data-dependent, and he seems to feel no need to guarantee any pauses. The Dollar seems to be naturally strengthening, equities may even feel some downward pressure, but I still sense that down the line there will be a decoupling of Dollar-advancement tied to Fed hawkishness. There are signs that borrowing costs have increased to a point of denting demand, especially for Housing, so if anything there are chance the economy may not stay so hot in order to feel the need to hike interest rates again.\u201d\n\nCHRISTOPHER HODGE, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cHe was very quick to assure markets that the Fed won\u2019t be hanging any 'mission accomplished' banners any time soon, but still highlighted the need to data dependence. Clearly softer labor and economic indicators are needed before any pivot in tone, but just reiterating the higher for longer narrative by itself restricts financial conditions by pushing up mortgage and corp borrowing rates (see the Fed\u2019s FCI-G and movements along the curve in recent weeks) and may alleviate the need for more hikes.\"\n\n\"It was a change in emphasis, highlighting the potential need for more tightening, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that softer incoming data will keep the fed comfortable with current levels and allow previous hikes and current conditions to work their way through the system. I think the Fed is legitimately split on what to do now making incoming data, starting with next week\u2019s NFP and JOLTS, even more important.\"\n\nMICHAEL GREEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SIMPLIFY ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\u201cThe best way to think about it is: it was largely non information. It is an acknowledgment of some progress that has been made. It's a reiteration that the Fed at best is going to go very slowly and cautiously.\"\n\n\u201cPeople had been prepared for volatility if that volatility fails to emerge. Then the big winner here are people who had actually sold insurance in the market. I don't think anyone's going to meaningfully change their positions after this speech.\"\n\nANDRE BAKHOS, MANAGING MEMBER, INGENIUM ANALYTICS LLC, PLAINSBORO, NEW JERSEY.\n\n\"August has been a difficult month for the market, so it is hungry for news that will help reverse the trend. Investors are hanging on to every word, but the main takeaway is that Powell signalled that the Fed would raise rates if needed. Around that concept, we're going get intraday volatility.\"\n\nCARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO, ING, FRANKFURT\n\"The speech was as expected. I don't think it's overly dovish as the market reaction suggests. A pause in September is likely but this is not an official end to hikes. This is the best Powell could do in the current circumstances.\"\n\n\"The alternative would have been to sound very hawkish, triggering turmoil, or sound very dovish, which is not good if inflation comes back, so this strikes a good balance. I think (ECB chief Christine) Lagarde will do the same later.\u201d\n\nJOSEPH LAVORGNA, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SMBC NIKKO SECURITIES, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cI have him leaning a little bit more on the hawkish side because it seems to me that while they're talking risk management, I just don't see anything that suggests that they're going to cut rates anytime soon.\"\n\n\u201cHe's finding the flexibility to hike more, not buying the flexibility necessarily to ease. It seems to me it's between hiking more and staying on hold rather than, \u2018OK we're kind of where we need to be and policy is symmetrical.\u2019 But, I don't think another hike is coming.\u201d\n\nSTUART COLE, CHIEF MACRO ECONOMIST, EQUITI CAPITAL, LONDON\n\n\u201cPowell\u2019s message is largely as expected, that is progress is being made in the fight against CPI but it is too soon to say the battle is won and the Fed is prepared to hike further if necessary. My hunch is that he is being seen as not as hawkish as had been feared.\u201d\n\nQUINCY KROSBY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n\"He is outlining the backdrop for the path of inflation, the trajectory that we have witnessed. But overall his core message is that two months, three months does not necessarily make the trend. There is still quite a bit to focus on. The 12-month trajectory is still elevated... He said there's still work to be done. And this is not different from some of the press conferences we have seen following the last couple of rate hikes. There's nothing in this that should be a surprise or a shock. He is staying close to his message, and that is we cannot declare victory yet.\"\n\nDAVID WAGNER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS, CINCINNATI, OHIO\n\"Historically, the average Jackson Hole event doesn\u2019t generate more market volatility than any other trading day. But, much like we expected, Jerome Powell took a pass this year as he kept his message clear and concise. He remained hawkish and held policy at restrictive levels until we brought inflation down. Even though inflation has come down, it remains too high.\"\n\n\"Given the market's expectation of 100bps worth of cuts by the end of '24, we think that this meeting will continue to fly in the face of investors as they will have to digest higher rates for longer, which can ultimately reintroduce the right tail risk of interest rates into the market causing valuations to contract.\"\n\n\"Powell basically disabused investors that cuts are right around the corner, with ample retread on how far they still are from their price objective.\"\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, WISCONSIN\n\"There were many words, but little was said. Rather than last year's short but brutal speech, Powell opted for a longer and calmer speech. The key word was 'carefully.' They will proceed carefully instead of forcefully.\"\n\n\"He was close to breaking his arm patting himself on the back for orchestrating a soft-landing. The jury is still out on that, though. Long and variable lags aren't dead.\"\n\nKARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CORPAY, TORONTO\n\"On balance, this is a modestly less hawkish speech than markets had feared. Powell recycled a lot of the \"higher for longer\" language used last year, but also said policymakers will \"proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data\" - messaging that clearly puts the central bank on a data-dependent footing in the near term.\"\n\n\"Powell's words lacked the drama associated with previous speeches from Bernanke and Draghi, and even fell short of the directness found in his own appearances, but we would argue this is a good thing - conditions remain too uncertain for black-and-white messaging, and markets should welcome a more gradualist and incremental approach at this point in the tightening cycle. Odds on another move by year end should come down, and the dollar looks likely to lose some altitude - particularly relative to the euro.\"\n\nCompiled by the Global Finance & Markets Breaking News team","labels":["investments"]}

We've gathered articles on the news from SHRM Online and other media outlets.\n\nLayoffs Challenged Based on Gender\n\nSoon after Elon Musk bought Twitter, the company laid off about 3,700 employees\u2014roughly half its workforce\u2014and hundreds more then resigned. The new lawsuit said that Twitter laid off 57 percent of its female employees, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender disparity was greater for engineering roles, where 63 percent of women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"It's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when Elon Musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,\" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, the plaintiffs' lawyer, who is in Boston.\n\nTwitter has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit involving the alleged failure to provide advance notice and hasn't responded to other complaints.\n\nOther Complaints\n\nOther complaints against Twitter claim it backed out of promises to allow remote work and provide consistent severance benefits after Musk bought the company, as well as complaints related to alleged disability- and gender-based discrimination and another lawsuit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off. At least one employee claimed that Twitter did not provide enough notice of the layoffs, allegedly violating federal and California laws, and did not offer additional pay in lieu of notice. Three claims also have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.\n\nTwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.\n\nLayoffs Snowball\n\nTwitter isn't the only company that has laid off workers. The technology sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands laid off, including from Meta and Stripe. Sales and recruiting jobs have sustained some of the deepest cuts. In addition, layoffs have spread beyond technology, such as to the Walt Disney Co.\n\nLayoffs Are Harming DE&I Efforts\n\nRecent layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, have eroded diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts nationwide. The tech industry already is one of the least diverse. In 2021, just 4.4 percent of employees at Google were Black and 6.4 percent were Latino, according to the company's diversity report. At Meta, people with disabilities represented about 6 percent of the company's workforce, despite accounting for 19 percent of the U.S. labor force.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Go Airlines (India) Ltd was granted bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, bolstering the country's fourth largest carrier's chances of getting back on its feet, but lessors have started mounting legal challenges to repossess planes.\n\nThe low-cost carrier, recently rebranded as Go First, was plunged into financial crisis this year, sparked by what it called \"faulty\" Pratt & Whitney engines that grounded about half its 54 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neos.\n\n\nThe U.S. engine maker, part of Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N), in a statement said Go First's allegations were \"without merit\".\n\nIn granting bankruptcy protection, the National Company Law Tribunal in New Delhi ordered a moratorium on Go First's assets and leases and appointed Abhilash Lal of Alvarez & Marsal as the interim resolution professional to take over management with immediate effect.\n\nThe resolution professional \"shall ensure that retrenchment of employees is not resorted to as a matter of course\", the tribunal's 41-page order said. Go First has a staff of around 7,000.\n\nThe bankruptcy move adds to headaches for lessors, which have filed requests with India's aviation regulator for the return of about 40 Go First planes after rental payments were missed.\n\nIndia made it easier for lessors to take back planes if airlines default on payments after joining an international treaty known as the Cape Town Convention in 2008. But bankruptcy protection supersedes lessors' repossession requests.\n\n\"The next step for lessors is to approach the appellate tribunal... It will be a prolonged legal battle,\" said Ajay Kumar, managing partner at India's KLA Legal, which represents Go First lessors including Jackson Square Aviation and Bank of China Aviation.\n\nHe added that Go First's woes will lead to higher lease premiums for Indian airlines.\n\nThat could prove to be a pain point for the sector at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is touting the country's emergence as an aviation powerhouse, with bigger rivals IndiGo (INGL.NS) and Tata Group's Air India expanding aggressively.\n\nGo First's lessors also include SMBC Aviation Capital and CDB Aviation's GY Aviation Leasing.\n\nThey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, according to a filing seen by Reuters, SBMC Aviation Capital has already approached India's appeals tribunal seeking to quash the bankruptcy order.\n\n'HISTORIC' DECISION\nGo First's voluntary pursuit of bankruptcy protection to renegotiate contracts and debt marks a first for an Indian airline. CEO Kaushik Khona, who was present as the order was read, hailed the tribunal's decision as \"historic\".\n\nThe airline, which had a 7% share of the world's third largest aviation market in March, has currently suspended all flights due to \"operational reasons\" and is not taking new bookings.\n\nReviving the carrier - one of the hardest hit worldwide by problems with Pratt & Whitney engines - will not be easy, said Abhirup Dasgupta, a partner at HAS Advocates who specialises in insolvency law but is not involved in Go First's proceedings.\n\nIt will require fresh funds, and lenders could be wary of investing, he said.\n\nGo First's bankruptcy filing lists Central Bank of India Ltd (CBI.NS), Bank of Baroda Ltd (BOB.NS), IDBI Bank Ltd (IDBI.NS), and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) among financial creditors which are owed 65.21 billion rupees ($798 million).\n\nThe airline's total liabilities stand at 114.63 billion Indian rupees, including dues to banks, financial institutions, vendors and aircraft lessors.\n\nIt's also not clear when the dispute with Pratt & Whitney will be resolved. Go First won an arbitration case in Singapore that ordered the U.S. firm to dispatch spare engines to the airline, and has since approached a Delaware Court to request that it be enforced.\n\nPratt & Whitney plans to oppose the move, a Delaware court filing showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Indian tribunal said the new resolution professional will take \"all necessary steps including the execution of the arbitral award\".\n\nIn its statement, Pratt & Whitney said it will vigorously defend itself against Go's claims, and was pursuing its own legal recourse.","labels":["financial_distress","supplychain"]}

Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., is seen outside the U.S. Capitol after the last votes of the week on Thursday, June 15, 2023. (Tom Williams\/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nRep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., is seen outside the U.S. Capitol after the last votes of the week on Thursday, June 15, 2023.\nTom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\nThe House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent letters to four separate U.S. venture capital firms, including Qualcomm\u2019s\n venture arm, expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d about their investments in Chinese tech startups.\n\nThe letters, which were made public on Wednesday, were sent to GGV Capital, GST Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, and Walden International. They were written by and Wisconsin Republican Mike Gallagher and Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top two members on the committee.\n\nOf particular concern to the lawmakers are investments in artificial intelligence, chipmakers and quantum computing companies in China. They also noted that some of the companies to receive U.S. money have been linked to the profiling and tracking of Uyghur ethnic minorities in China.\n\n\u201cLike AI, the domestic development of semiconductors is a top priority of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d the letter says. \u201cSemiconductors are essential for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other advanced dual use technology.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from the four venture firms who received the letters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe outreach represents the latest bipartisan effort by politicians to step up pressure on U.S. investments in China as tension swells between the world\u2019s two largest economies and national security concerns escalate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen traveled to China earlier this month as part of a plan to stabilize relations with China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited in June.\n\nIn their letter, Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi linked dozens of particular investments to human rights violations and efforts to enhance China\u2019s military, which runs counter to American interests.\n\nQualcomm Ventures, for example, made 13 investments in Chinese A.I. companies from 2015 to 2021, according to the letter. One investment was in SenseTime, which a New York Times report linked to Chinese tracking and profiling of the Uyghurs.\n\nIn addition to Qualcomm, PitchBook data shows that U.S. firms Tiger Global Management and Silver Lake, which were not mentioned in the letter, invested in SenseTime prior to its 2021 IPO.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said Tiger had since fully exited its position in SenseTime, which it had taken on prior to the New York Times reporting.\n\nSilver Lake did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s investment in Denglin Technology, an apparent competitor, also faces Congressional scrutiny. Qualcomm was one of Denglin\u2019s earliest backers, according to PitchBook, and invested in an additional 2022 funding round.\n\nThe firm with the most potentially problematic investments, according to the letter is GGV Capital, which has offices in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore. The letter identified 43 different investments in Chinese AI companies from 2015 to 2021, more than any other identified by independent researchers at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nGGV has $9.2 billion in assets under management, and established operations on the ground in China in 2005. Even before that, it invested in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and subsequently backed TikTok parent ByteDance and ride-hailing company Didi.\n\nGallagher and Krishnamoorthi identify GGV\u2019s investment in Megvii, a Beijing-based facial recognition software provider, as a point of concern. The company \u201cactively supports the surveillance of Uyghurs,\u201d the letter says.\n\nMegvii is backed by a number of major investors, including Alibaba, Foxconn and the Macquarie Group. GGV invested in Megvii in 2019 alongside Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund in a deal that valued the company at about $4 billion.\n\nWalden, a smaller firm, was identified as a particularly significant backer of Chinese AI companies. The letter said that from 2015 to 2021, at least 39% of the firm\u2019s AI deals were in that sector, including one investment in a now blacklisted company called Intellifusion.\n\nIntellifusion has since gone public and has a market cap of 22 billion Chinese yuan, or roughly $3 billion.\n\nRegarding GSR Ventures, the letter said the firm \u201cwas among the top U.S.-located investors in PRC artificial intelligence companies between 2015 and 2021, according to a recent report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\u201d The lawmakers cited 33 distinct investments in the six-year period, including Horizon Robotics, which was last privately valued at $5 billion in 2021.\n\nThe letters advance Gallagher\u2019s push for controls on U.S. money in key technologies in China.\n\nAfter meeting with Silicon Valley executives in April, Gallagher told CNBC in an interview that he \u201cemerged from that day cautiously optimistic that we could put in place some sensible controls on American capital flowing to China that would allow us to not fund our own destruction or fund our own loss in the great AI race.\u201d \n\nHe said at the time he found there was \u201cbroad support\u201d among venture capitalists and others to keep U.S. asset managers from investing in Chinese AI firms.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has also considered steps to ensure U.S. technologies can\u2019t be overly leveraged by China to advance its own AI efforts. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the agency was weighing further limits on advanced chips used for AI that could be exported to China.\n\nPressure has been building on VC firms with substantial investments in China, in part due to concerns over intellectual property theft within technology and a budding AI race. Last month, legendary VC firm Sequoia Capital said it would split its international business into three parts, with Neil Shen helming its powerful Sequoia China unit.","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"In a major step forward for the reorganization of Celsius Network LLC and its affiliated debtors (the \"Debtors\"), the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved the adequacy of the Debtors\u2019 fourth amended disclosure statement and the solicitation and voting procedures for their joint plan of reorganization (the \"Plan\") on August 17, 2023. The court order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) sets forth the key dates and deadlines relating to the confirmation process, such as filing objections, voting on the Plan, and attending the confirmation hearing. The Order approving the disclosure statement can be found here.\n\nA hearing on confirmation of the plan is tentatively scheduled for October 2, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET. Prior to the confirmation hearing, creditors will have a chance to vote on the Plan and those Creditors eligible to vote will be receiving solicitation materials, likely in the next few days. The Plan that creditors are going to be voting on is substantially the same as the one that we analyzed in our prior post.\n\nThe following is a summary of some of the key terms contained in the Order and the Solicitation Procedures related to voting and confirmation of the Plan.\n\nThe Order establishes the following key dates and deadlines for the Plan confirmation process:\n \nThe Order also approved the Debtors\u2019 Solicitation Procedures, which govern the distribution of solicitation packages and the Plan voting process. The Solicitation Procedures provide for the following:\n\nSolicitation packages will include a cover letter, a letter from the official committee of unsecured creditors, the Solicitation Procedures, the applicable ballot form, a notice of claims settlement, the Disclosure Statement and its exhibits (including the Plan), the Order, the notice of the Confirmation Hearing, and any additional court-ordered documents.\n\nSolicitation packages will be distributed primarily via email (e.g., for account holders and other holders with email addresses on file). The Debtors will also cause a \u201cpush\u201d notification to be delivered via their mobile application to holders of certain claims. Physical packages will be provided upon request.\n\nHolders of claims entitled to vote on the Plan may submit their Ballots via (a) the Claims, Noticing, and Solicitation Agent's online voting platform at https:\/\/case.stretto.com\/Celsius\/balloting, or (b) mail or hand-delivery to the Claims, Noticing, and Solicitation Agent at Celsius Ballot Processing c\/o Stretto, 410 Exchange, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92602.\n\nNon-voting notices will be provided in lieu of Solicitation Packages for unimpaired claims, claims deemed to reject the Plan, disputed claims, and unclassified claims.\n\nOn the voting ballot, applicable creditors will have the option to opt out of the settlement, whereby claims are increased by 5% in exchange for waiving fraud claims.\n\nAssumption and rejection notices will be provided to contract counterparties.\n\nIrregular ballots will be subject to the Debtors' discretion (in consultation with the Committee).\n\nAmendments to plan documents will be allowed, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval and notice requirements.\n\nOne potentially noteworthy revision to the amended disclosure statement is pointing out that the Debtors have yet to settle with the CEL Token Holders and, to the extent that they have not done so by the time of the Confirmation Hearing and the CEL Token Holders vote to reject the Plan, they will look to the Court for guidance.\n\nRepayment to Earn and most other creditors will not take place until after the Plan is confirmed.\n\nThe Plan provides better treatment for those Creditors who actively vote for the plan, as such creditors should carefully review the Solicitation Procedures and the instructions on the ballot forms before voting on the Plan and consult with their legal advisors regarding their rights and obligations under the Plan. Creditors should also monitor the Debtors' case website at https:\/\/cases.stretto.com\/celsius\/ for any updates or amendments to the Plan, the Order, or the Solicitation Procedures. In particular, if there is any discrepancy in your claim type or amount you should reach out to Stretto, the company, or your legal counsel.","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"U.S. carriers are white-knuckling a brutal freight market. While data suggests the industry has finally reached the bottom of its freight rate bubble, a balanced market \u2014 and the relief it will deliver carriers \u2014 is likely a long way out.\n\nYet, forward-thinking shippers are moving away from bottom-of-the-barrel pricing and shifting to partners running more sustainable models.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s the hard-learned COVID lesson: Operations laser-focused on driving down costs and hyper-efficiency aren\u2019t resilient enough to weather disruption. Today, smart industry players recognize that strong, sustainable partners will buoy them when they\u2019re, once again, on the wrong side of market forces.\n\nFreight rates bottoming, not rebalancing\nOn July 8, FreightWaves reported that truckload spot rates, less estimated fuel costs, had risen about 13% since early May. This data suggests a stabilizing market, not one rebalancing. The Cass Freight Index provides additional support for a freight market cycle bottom.\n\n\u201cThe main takeaways as we close the first half of 2023 are that the market has found a demand floor and there is no strong evidence that spot rates will sustain their trend beyond the typical summer seasonality bump,\u201d said FreightWaves Market Expert and Market Analyst Zach Strickland.\n\n\nDesperation in the freight market; capacity correction on the horizon\nCarriers and 3PLs looking for promising news will find little from market analysts.\n\nExperts predict the economy will remain soft for the next four to five quarters as consumers, whose savings were depleted by inflationary prices, now face headwinds from high interest rates.\n\nAccording to FreightWaves\u2019 head of ocean intelligence, Henry Byers, the import container market will be largely static for the remainder of 2023, following the 2018-2019 trend lines. The Christmas peak: Expect it to resemble more of a gentle bump given available U.S. inventory.\n\nContract rate corrections are also looming for some. Those that locked in elevated rates during the previous RFP season have been sustained through the soft market. As large shippers enter the new RFP season this fall, those contracts won\u2019t be as favorable \u2014 falling in line with the spot market.\n\nOf course, shrinking margins and break-even rates are only part of the story. Carrier costs are simultaneously increasing.\n\nAccording to the American Transportation Research Institute\u2019s June 2023 report, \u201cAn Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking,\u201d carrier wages were up 15.5%, truck\/trailer lease and purchase payments up 18.6%, and fuel costs up 53.7% in 2022 over the previous year.\n\n\nCurrently, it costs carriers $2.06 per mile to operate, less fuel costs \u2014 an untenable situation for many.\n\nWhile Yellow\u2019s bankruptcy filing could offer a semblance of relief to its competitors, most can expect a rocky road ahead.\n\nCarriers and 3PLs chasing discount buyers will be forced from the market\nFor two years, shippers and importers got destroyed by sky-high freight rates. Some closed up shop. Now, the surviving shippers and importers are taking their pound of flesh \u2014 securing ridiculously low rates to make up for their previous two years of hardship.\n\nYellow aside, the big nationwide companies with deep pockets will weather the storm. But the 10-to-30-truck operations that make up the majority of the U.S. carrier base can\u2019t sustain these perilously low rates for long. In fact, carrier bankruptcies are already a regular drumbeat in transportation media, with the Southwest region bearing the brunt: Carriers there operate at the highest cost in the country \u2014 a $2.303 average marginal cost per mile.\n\nWhen these businesses go under, capacity will go down \u2014 not only impacting drayage but regular domestic over-the-road as well.\n\nStrong partners are key to resilience, blunting extreme freight rate swings\nRate deals and spikes don\u2019t last forever, and smart industry players know caring for the partners who will sustain them when the market inevitably shifts is mission-critical.\n\n\nShippers hold the upper hand today, and many are looking to pare down their vendors. But those who place a premium on resilience, not just price, focus on the carriers and brokers they\u2019ll need when capacity gets extremely tight. They know trusted relationships take time to build, and that they\u2019ll pay off when their partners are bombarded with 50 calls a day and prioritize their business.\n\nIn this current environment, it\u2019s not difficult to find capacity, and shippers can vet sustainable partners with a small percentage of their existing freight \u2014 providing a good test of new providers without jeopardizing existing partner relationships.\n\nAs they do, they can look for signals that the partner is built to withstand market downturns including:\n\nConsistently high on-time pickup and delivery rates.\nFair market freight rates (versus unsustainable pricing).\nCapabilities, technologies and high service levels that simplify their work.\nShippers working with 3PLs should also assess the carrier vetting and onboarding tools they have in place to protect their freight from rising fraud.\n\nWhat they\u2019ll discover is that sustainably priced carriers and 3PLs continue to invest in new processes and technologies, enabling them to better protect their business. Meanwhile, those running on fumes right now won\u2019t be able to scale when the freight market booms.\n\nOn the flip side, shippers will need to keep in mind that sustainability-minded carriers are looking for partners that:\n\nPay rates that are fair in the market rather than hammering them into the dust.\nProvide clear, accurate information.\nKeep the lines of communication open and flowing.\nAs always, the freight rate boom-and-bust cycle creates chaos in the market.\n\nBut for those who value the sustainability of their business partners, that chaos will breed opportunity.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

That\u2019s a disappointment, as analysts have been forecasting the Boeing would report a narrow profit for the quarter.\n\nShares of Boeing (BA) were down more than 3% in late morning trading after that guidance.\n\nBoeing has reported only two profitable quarters in the nearly four years since the grounding of the 737 Max. After two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, the jet was grounded for 20 months starting in March 2019. Then a year later, the pandemic brought demand for flying and new aircraft to a near halt \u2014 sparking the cancellation of hundreds of jet orders and the pileup of losses for Boeing.\n\nStill, the industry has shown signs of picking up, and analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast that Boeing would earn 26 cents a share. Instead it reported a loss of $1.75 a share. So while that\u2019s an improvement from the loss of $7.69 a share in the fourth quarter of of 2021, it\u2019s also another big disappointment.\n\nA difficult few years\nBoeing\u2019s problems in the fourth quarter are tied to its difficult few years since the 737 Max crisis.\n\nFor one, the company was saddled with excess inventory of hundreds of the jets. Usually Boeing doesn\u2019t hold onto inventory, as planes are delivered to customers soon after completion.\n\nBut even though the 737 Max jets couldn\u2019t be delivered during the grounding, Boeing kept building them \u2014 partly to keep its suppliers in business. Then it was forced to find new buyers for some of those planes due to customers canceling orders during the pandemic.\n\nBeyond the Max, the FAA flagged quality problems with the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliners that stopped it from delivering that model. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still affected the company: Much of Boeing\u2019s abnormal production costs last quarter were a result of having to rework both the Max and Dreamliner jets, CEO Dave Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday.\n\nThe supply chain problems are improving, Calhoun added, but they are not behind the company or the aerospace industry as a whole, He suggested more money-losing quarters may be ahead despite a rebound in demand, saying he expects Boeing to have \u201cbouncy\u201d margins throughout the year as its Max and Dreamliner inventories are cleared.\n\nBoeing delivered 152 commercial jets in the quarter, up 54% from a year ago and better than its own target.\n\nBut digging deeper into the financial results highlights a potential problem: It appears Boeing received lower prices on some of its planes than analysts had expected.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company\u2019s revenue fell short of forecasts, coming in at just below $20 billion. While it was Boeing\u2019s highest revenue figure since the start of the pandemic, it was about $360 million less than analysts\u2019 consensus estimate. The combination of better-than-expected deliveries but worse-than-forecast revenue suggests that weaker pricing.\n\n\u2018Focused on driving stability\u2019\nBoeing tried to put the best spin possible on its disappointing results.\n\nThe company pointed out that this was the first full year of positive operating cash flow since the start of the 737 Max crisis. Boeing finally brought in $3.5 billion more cash than it spent, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 of positive operating cash flow of between $4.5 bililon to $6.5 billion.\n\n\u201cDemand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond,\u201d said Calhoun in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWhile challenges remain, we are well positioned and are on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress","supplychain"]}

{"text":"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. \u2014 A mix of cost savings, faster transit times and sustainability benefits drew two major customers to use DHL\u2019s new temperature-controlled air cargo service out of Indianapolis.\n\nSpeaking Friday at Indianapolis International Airport, supply chain leaders at Siemens and Eli Lilly said the offering from DHL Global Forwarding will allow their perishable products to be transported with less packaging.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing, amazing game changer,\u201d said Chris Goss, a senior director of transportation at Siemens. \u201cSustainability is one thing, but this really does it in a whole different way.\u201d\n\nOur solutions prevent forklift accidents, reduce labor costs, improve fleet utilization, and help warehouse managers make smarter data-driven decisions.\n\nSee the AI Solution\nThe new service from DHL\u2019s freight forwarding unit is supported by a $1.5 million, temperature-controlled facility with direct ramp access at Indianapolis International Airport and a dedicated connection to Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, through MSC Air Cargo\u2019s B777F aircraft. The service has two flights per week to Li\u00e8ge, a destination providing easy access to much of Europe, said Jose Maria de Orduna, regional vice president, U.S. East Region for DHL Global Forwarding.\n\nThe service\u2019s innovative handling process is designed to safely ship pharmaceuticals and other life-sciences products without the need for more expensive and energy-intensive \u201cactive packaging\u201d such as temperature-controlled containers.\n\nInstead, DHL reduces transportation costs and transit times by using passive packaging \u2014 like thermal blankets that insulate the cargo. By having the facility located near the tarmac at the airport, DHL can quickly load containers into the temperature-controlled aircraft to keep products in their required temperature range while using less passive packaging than what perishable goods shippers often use to keep products unspoiled.\n\nA heavy amount of packaging on a product can increase weight and, consequently, costs. De Orduna recalled one DHL customer that used a large amount of passive packaging to transport products that was thrown away each week.\n\n\u201cWith a solution like this, they can reduce the amount of passive packaging, and now it\u2019s more cost-effective,\u201d de Orduna said, adding that companies\u2019 sustainability efforts also improve by using less packaging.\n\n\nPasive packaging, like thermal blankets that insulate cargo, help DHL Global Forwarding reduce transportation costs and transit times in its new service.\nMax Garland \/ Supply Chain Dive\n \nSiemens began assessing DHL Global Forwarding\u2019s Indianapolis service in February, making sure it delivered in terms of transit times and temperature control, Goss said. For example, Siemens tested DHL\u2019s capabilities by placing general cargo within a thermal wrap and pre-chilling it to mimic the characteristics of a perishable product before shipping it.\n\n","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"Amidst a decline in foreign funding, China's banking and corporate elite have increasingly turned to domestic capital sources.\nAn intriguing approach to accessing these funds has surfaced, aptly dubbed \"throwing eggs,\" a term that refers to Guandan, a card game reminiscent of poker.\nThis interest was piqued by the game's popularity among affluent local government officials in the eastern provinces.\nChina's bankers and business executives have become increasingly reliant on domestic capital in recent years as foreign funding has dried up, but a popular way to unlock that cash may very well involve \"throwing eggs\".\n\nThe term refers to Guandan, a poker-like card game that has been around for decades, but has gained fresh life among venture capitalists a few years ago as they awoke to its popularity among wealthy local government officials in eastern regions.\n\n\"Officials like this game, so we play along,\" said Yang Yiming, an investment banker whose job involves canvassing government funding for projects linked to semiconductors and defence.\n\n\nThe growing interest in business circles has spawned a craze for the game nationwide, driven partly by financial constraints stemming from souring ties with China's biggest trade partner, the United States.\n\nThis month U.S. President Joe Biden barred some investment in semiconductors and set controls on other sensitive sectors, aiming to curb trade and funding that could give rival Beijing an edge in technology.\n\nTotal U.S.-based venture-capital investment in China plummeted to $9.7 billion last year from $32.9 billion in 2021, PitchBook data shows.\n\nDomestic private capital has also dwindled as President Xi Jinping signalled his preference for a bigger state presence in the economy by launching crackdowns over the last few years in areas from technology to real estate and private tutoring.\n\nAs investment prospects darken, financiers increasingly view the game as a way to build 'guanxi' or connections with officials who hold the purse strings on local projects, especially those overseas investors might consider too risky.\n\n\"In finance, information is currency,\" said Yang, for whom a game of guandan has become a standard gambit before wining and dining local officials.\n\n\n\"During a game which can stretch for hours, we are bound to chit-chat, and sometimes useful information gets passed around after people feel comfortable and trust you.\"\n\nYu Longze, a broker based in Beijing, said his boss this month ordered all staff to learn the game.\n\nLike bridge, the classic staple, the game is played among four players paired up in teams. Using two decks, players must throw down poker and other special card combinations to clear their hands before opponents.\n\n\"From observing someone's playing style, you can tell if he is smart, aggressive or a team player. This can help you decide if you want him as a business partner,\" said a businessman surnamed Huang, who runs a private clubhouse where the game has become a favourite pastime of officials and company executives.\n\nBut not everyone treats guandan as a business tool.\n\nMany players say they simply enjoy the mental stimulation from a game that is cheap, convenient to play and allows them to socialise - aspects that, taken together, explain its appeal to all walks of life.\n\nCustomers ranged from retired people to young professionals seeking to build new social ties, said Hua Min, who this year opened the first bar dedicated to hosting guandan games in Beijing, the capital.\n\nLi Keshu, a lawyer, said playing with his friends in a park helped get through the social isolation and economic frustration of the COVID-19 years, when China threw up strict barriers against infection.\n\n\"It's cost-free. Unlike 'Texas Hold'em' or mahjong, this game doesn't need to be played with money to be fun. On the contrary, money spoils the friendship and the game.\"\n\nWhile the players Reuters spoke to said they do not gamble, Chinese officials have been censured in the past for receiving bribes through the playing of card games or the traditional tile pastime of mahjong.\n\nIn April, the ruling Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog censured one of its officials in the eastern province of Anhui for playing guandan during a training course, among other misdeeds.\n\nIn a sign that Beijing is not perturbed by the growing interest in the game, however, China's national sports authority has organised the first nationwide guandan competition this year.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","investments"]}

It expects free cash flow after leases to grow by at least 40% to more than \u20ac16 billion.\n\nDT\u2019s upbeat outlook comes after it exceeded its guidance for 2022, with full-year revenue growing 6.1 percent year-on-year to \u20ac114.4 billion. It is no mean feat given DT raised its guidance multiple times last year, most recently in November, when it increased its EBITDA AL forecast to more than \u20ac37 billion from its previous target of around \u20ac37 billion. Not only that, but net profit almost doubled to \u20ac8 billion from \u20ac4.2 billion.\n\nDT capped off 2022 with a strong fourth quarter, as group revenue grew 4% to \u20ac29.8 billion, and EBITDA AL jumped 10.6% to \u20ac9.96 billion from \u20ac9.01 billion.\n\nAs per usual, the telco\u2019s domestic and US operations gave the standout performances.\n\nIn Germany, DT added 225,000 postpaid mobile customers, driving mobile service revenue up by 3.5% compared to Q4 last year. It also added 372,000 fibre customers during the quarter, increasing its overall broadband based by 74,000.

DT\u2019s US arm turned over \u20ac19.8 billion in Q4, up 8.3% on the prior year. However, in dollars, revenue was actually down 3.3% to $20.2 billion.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile US is systematically scaling back the terminal equipment lease business for its customers, which was taken over as part of the business combination with Sprint. This has a reducing effect on total revenue,\u201d Deutsche Telekom explained in its earnings report. Q4 service revenue at T-Mobile US grew to \u20ac15.2 billion from \u20ac12.8 billion.\n\nThe US and Germany helped to offset a lacklustre year in Europe, which saw revenue fall 1.2% to \u20ac11.2 billion. In Q4, revenue came in at \u20ac2.9 billion, flat compared to last year. Full-year EBITDA AL inched down to \u20ac3.9 billion from \u20ac4 billion, and in Q4 it fell to \u20ac956 million from \u20ac962 million.\n\n\u201cThe upheavals in the world, and their consequences, are not without their effects on Deutsche Telekom,\u201d said chairman and CEO Tim H\u00f6ttges, in a very brief statement. \u201cBut by continuing to execute our strategy, we were nevertheless able to meet all of our targets in 2022.\u201d","labels":["investments"]}

In January, the board authorized the company to hire law firm ArentFox Schiff LLP to review policies, submit a report and make recommendations.\n\nMicrosoft published a 50-page transparency report from ArentFox on Tuesday. The report is significant in an industry that\u2019s making pronounced efforts to improve diversity and ensure that sexual misconduct is taken seriously. At Microsoft, claims of harassment and discrimination have led to internal discussions that spilled over into public view.\n\n\u201cThe board of directors and our senior leaders are fully committed to this implementation plan as we continually work to close the gap between our espoused culture and the lived experience of our employees,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a company blog post.\n\nThe shareholder proposal was brought last year by Arjuna Capital. It followed a report about Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates\u2019 departure from the company\u2019s board after it investigated a claim that Gates had tried to start a relationship with an employee two decades ago.\n\nSuch proposals typically fail, and the company had recommended that shareholders vote against it. But it received 77.97% of all votes, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe report on Tuesday referenced the Gates incident and provided some details. Kathleen Hogan is the company\u2019s head of human resources and executive vice president.\n\n\u201cOn July 7, 2019, Person A, a Microsoft employee, reported to Kathleen Hogan that Bill Gates had subjected her to inappropriate communications and conduct,\u201d the transparency report said. \u201cIn doing so, Person A made references to sexual harassment and the me too movement.\u201d\n\nThe woman met Gates for the first time in 1999, and they then met in person \u201cintermittently\u201d after that, the report said. The company hired a law firm to look into the woman\u2019s assertions and found that that they did meet and communicate. Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, discussed the assertions with Gates, who said that the relationship had been consensual.\n\nIn a statement, Arjuna Capital said the report, citing privacy reasons, doesn\u2019t offer much new detail on the investigation of Gates. But it acknowledged significant changes Microsoft has agreed to make around holding executives accountable.\n\nMicrosoft said in its blog post Tuesday that it will add language, as suggested in the report, to its policy against harassment and discrimination, enhance executive training, reevaluate the terms of substantiated violations of the policy and look at ways to address concerns about negative career impact for those who raise complaints.\n\nMicrosoft received 721 employee complaints of discrimination and harassment in the U.S. between 2019 and 2021, and investigators found most allegations to be unsubstantiated, according to the report.\n\nThe law firm spoke with some of the people who brought complaints in 2021 and found that many worried that their actions or being part of an investigation could hurt their career prospects, even if complaints were substantiated. Some of these people said their promotions or pay increases were delayed because their alleged harassment or discrimination had weighed on their performance reviews, and they were unhappy that human resources had told them there was no way to deal with that sort of impact.\n\nSome of the people the law firm interviewed said they disliked that investigators declared their complaints were unsubstantiated and not severe enough to violate Microsoft\u2019s policy against discrimination and harassment.\n\nMicrosoft said it will provide data each year on harassment reports, the percentage of claims that have been substantiated and the company\u2019s responses.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"SUNNYSIDE, Wash. \u2014 Jose Martinez has lived and worked in the United States since he was 14 years old. Now 67, he drives around the Yakima Valley in Washington state checking on fellow workers.\n\n\"When it's hot, do you have a place to protect yourself from the sun and heat?\" he calls out to some workers on the side of an apple orchard on a sunny June morning.\n\nMartinez worked in agriculture across the fields of California and, most recently, Washington state. Irrigation, grapes, apples, mushrooms, dairies and now cherries. He's done a little bit of everything.\n\n\"I love the fields because you're in the open air,\" he told NPR in his native Spanish, sitting on the lawn outside his home in Sunnyside, Wash. \"It's beautiful. I am proud to do it, to be a farmworker. Why not?\"\n\nWhen people think of farmworkers, often they think of migrant workers and labor organizers like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Now, they may add another name to those creating major changes in the farming workplace: Jose Martinez.\n\nOver the past decade, Martinez has been central to two flagship lawsuits creating policy changes in the state \u2014 making Washington one of the leaders in providing overtime to farmworkers and settling a civil rights case in favor of workers. And recently, he has taken his fight to Washington, D.C., where he has pushed for an expansion of legal status and protections for farmworkers.\n\nFederally, farmworkers are largely excluded from many federal workplace safety regulations. They don't have a right to overtime pay or to unionize, and children as young as 12 can legally work in the fields. As a result, some states, like Washington, have extended additional rights and regulations.\n\nPresident Biden came into office with the goal of expanding protections to farmworkers, including providing a pathway to legal status, overtime pay, sick leave and protection from heat exposure. But despite being the self-proclaimed most pro-labor president, his administration has faced roadblocks such as stalled nominations and legislation in Congress, and slow rulemaking, to make big changes a reality.\n\nMartinez's route to legal advocacy has not been easy\nThe Washington worker's journey to becoming an activist began nearly 14 years ago. That's when Martinez began working in a dairy.\n\n\"At that dairy is when I started to see workplace violations and abuses from the foremen to the workers,\" Martinez recalled. \"And that's when I began to do something about the rights that we have as workers in the fields.\"\n\nMartinez said that while working, he and his fellow farmworkers didn't get lunch or other breaks.\n\nSo he sought the help of Columbia Legal Services, a law firm in Washington that, in part, focuses on immigration issues.\n\n\"We began to fight and that overtime [for farmworkers] was born within the state of Washington,\" he said.\n\nThe lawsuit he filed argued that a failure to provide overtime pay violates state protections against discrimination.\n\n\"In that dairy, you had to eat with a taco in one hand and work,\" he recalled. \"There were chemicals, rats. You had to eat and run among the cows. They said it was an eight-hour shift, but sometimes it was 12. And we were not paid overtime.\"\n\nDue to a Jim Crow-era exemption in federal law, most farmworkers in the U.S. do not have the right to overtime pay.\n\nMartinez wins overtime for dairy workers in the state\nIn the fall of 2020, the Washington Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that dairy workers should be entitled to overtime pay.\n\n\"Wow, I felt so emotional,\" Martinez said, remembering how he reacted to the court's decision.\n\nThe Washington state legislature then created a law to provide overtime for all farmworkers, a phased-in process that has already begun. By 2024, farmers will have to pay workers overtime after 40 hours.\n\nOther states, including California, Colorado and New York, have passed their own laws in recent years requiring additional pay for people working on farms specifically.\n\nMartinez said not all workers have been happy with the deal. As an unintended consequence, farmers are hiring more workers to avoid paying overtime wages, resulting in lower wages overall for some longtime employees. While some advocates say they expected this to happen in some instances, Martinez told NPR he did not.\n\nThese farmworkers thought a new overtime law would help them. Now, they want it gone\n\"There are a few different points of view,\" he acknowledged, saying that some workers blame him for their now-smaller paychecks. \"But why don't we work the same long hours and get paid better? Why don't they pay us better?\"\n\nJose Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers after a COVID-19 outbreak at the mushroom farm where he was then employed and is now working with the group to form a union at the facility.\nMike Kane for NPR\nSome farmworkers want to get rid of the overtime law. Martinez sees it differently. He's going for bigger change \u2014 higher wages so that farmworkers don't feel they need to work 60 to 70 hours a week in harvest season to make enough to live on.\n\n\"I had faith that when I start something, I will finish it and it will be done,\" he said. \"I've never been afraid.\"\n\nA civil rights lawsuit rises out of a mushroom farm\nMartinez ultimately quit the dairy. He moved on to work for a fruit packing company, which he said had better working conditions. But the company closed to become a winery. In 2020, he began work only a few miles away at Ostrom Mushroom Farms, a mushroom producer later acquired by the Canadian company Windmill Farms.\n\nJust over a year after being at Ostrom, Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers, an organization that he recalled from his years on farms in the San Joaquin Valley in California. He voiced concerns over poor treatment from supervisors and went public about COVID-19 outbreaks. During those conversations Martinez tipped off a lawsuit through the state attorney general's office over gender discrimination.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the mushroom farm would pay $3.4 million to about 170 workers, resolving a lawsuit \"asserting unfair, deceptive and discriminatory actions against female farmworkers and Washington-based workers.\"\n\nFerguson told NPR that while he believes this is a case of a very bad actor, it won't be his office's last case and farmworkers are among the workers in the most difficult position to advocate for themselves.\n\n\"They may not be documented, they may not speak English, there are restrictions that make it difficult,\" Ferguson explained, as to why they may not speak up.\n\nMartinez agrees that getting workers to want to talk is a challenge.\n\n\"It was really hard at first to convince the workers [to speak up],\" Martinez said. \"First thing they said is 'they'll chase me out; I have bills to pay and a family.'\"\n\nMartinez, who has legal status, says workers who are undocumented are even more afraid to voice concerns. It is estimated that over half of all farmworkers in the U.S. are undocumented and those on visas are tied to their employers for housing, transportation and documentation.\n\n\"There is sometimes a misunderstanding about the rights that we have as workers,\" Martinez said. \"But when we are working somewhere, we do have rights to a certain extent.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, he noticed workers were arriving on seasonal H-2A visas, and women were particularly being laid off.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I told them I also have a family, but I want to stop this and what they are doing is not right \u2014 they are violating your rights as a worker and we all have rights,\" Martinez explained.\n\n\nIt's hot. For farmworkers without federal heat protections, it could be life or death\nHe's now leading a unionization effort at the mushroom farm. But should a union ever be recognized, Martinez won't be part of it. His employment was terminated on April 20 for unsatisfactory performance upon evaluation and \"no improvement in the allocated time,\" according to an employment separation form obtained by NPR.\n\nJose Martinez stands in his home in Sunnyside, Wash., on June 13. His lawsuit against an area dairy farm led to the establishment of overtime rules for farmworkers in Washington state.\nMike Kane for NPR\nHanging on the wall of his living room are certificates from Ostrom for having the best attendance just months before being laid off.\n\n\"I am proud of my roots,\" Martinez said. \"And I will keep fighting to make changes to benefit future generations.\"","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

People are home and they want to improve their homes.\u201d\n\nOne of the main issues, Snabe said, is there aren\u2019t enough truck drivers to pick up containers from the ports.\n\nBy the end of last week, 84 vessels had to wait for an average of 18 days in front of ports, Snabe said. \u201cThat takes capacity out of the shipping industry because they are lying there idle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have higher demand and lower capacity, not because we don\u2019t have enough vessels, but because they are not sailing because of congestion,\u201d Snabe added. \u201cWe have to balance that out.

Scope Group, a financial ratings firm, reports that the world\u2019s 10 largest pharmas collectively have $120 billion (\u20ac111 billion) in cash on their balance sheets. \u201cThe pharmaceutical sector will remain one of the few industry sectors where M&A [mergers and acquisitions] remains buoyant despite rising interest rates, but large mergers and cross-border transactions are not likely,\u201d stated a report by Olaf T\u00f6lke, Scope\u2019s director of corporate ratings.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies are flush with cash. The sustained pandemic impact on demand for vaccines, treatments and Covid-related diagnostics, and more indirectly, government recognition of the importance of public health investment, have combined to increase cash inflows, providing them with the means to undertake ambitious acquisitions,\u201d said the Scope report. These large companies include well-known names like Pfizer, MSD (Merck Sharp & Dohme), Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Roche.\n\n\nScope believes medium-sized mergers and acquisitions will emerge in the months ahead, targeting specific therapeutic areas of specialization, such as cardiology, oncology, neurology, and diabetes. Amgen\u2019s acquisition of Horizon for around $40 billion is currently in the works. \u201cWe would not be surprised to see transactions of up to $20 billion.\u201d\n\nCompanies like these require continuous innovation to replace expiring drug patents and deliver products that serve the medical community and patients alike. When patent exclusivity is lost, drugs face stiff competition from generics and biosimilars, leading to lower sales and prices that ultimately affect the bottom line.\n\nPatent expiration\nThe expiration of drug patents poses a significant risk to major companies, as highlighted in the Scope report (citing Bloomberg data). Specifically, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) stands to lose 79% of its projected 2025 revenue between 2025 and 2029 due to loss of patent exclusivity. To fill the revenue gap, BMS must focus on developing and launching its own drugs or acquiring new therapies and companies in the years ahead. Among the companies most heavily affected by revenue loss from patent expiration are GSK (56%), Amgen (55%), MSD (49%), Lilly (46%), Johnson & Johnson (46%), and Roche (38%).\n\nPfizer, the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company, faces a 37% revenue loss from patent expiration. The company finds itself in a challenging predicament \u2014 the reduced global demand for its Covid-19 vaccine has led to a decline in revenue. To remedy this, Pfizer has signaled its willingness to explore acquisitions. Under the leadership of CEO Albert Bourla, Pfizer is projecting revenue of $67-$71 billion for 2023, a noticeable decline from its record-breaking $100 billion peak in 2022.\n\nIn the Scope report, T\u00f6lke says large pharmaceutical conglomerates are a thing of the past. Rather, highly capitalized companies are increasingly focused on efficiency, and are spinning off multi-million dollar ancillary businesses. Johnson & Johnson is a prime example of this trend, as it prepares to shed its huge consumer products division in the coming months.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"Just a few years ago, Chinese money was rippling across the rich world. Chinese investors were making blockbuster deals and snapping up trophy assets, from luxury homes and five-star hotels in New York to a Swiss chemical company and a German robotics giant. \n\nThat era is over.\n\nChinese investment is retreating from the West as hostility to Chinese capital has grown. Increasingly, Chinese companies are instead spending money on factories in Southeast Asia and mining and energy projects in Asia, the Middle East and South America, as Beijing seeks to cement alliances in those places and secure access to critical resources. \n\nThe biggest recipient of Chinese investment so far this year is nickel-rich Indonesia, according to a preliminary estimate of Chinese investments compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Nickel is a key component in many of the batteries used to power electric vehicles. \n\nThe shift in investment flows shows how China is responding to souring relations with the U.S.-led West, and is strengthening trade and investment links with other parts of the world, in ways that could create new fault lines in the global economy. \n\nThe retreat of Chinese money in the West could lead to less job creation in some countries, while also reducing the pool of capital into which entrepreneurs in places such as Silicon Valley can tap. China\u2019s weak economy is already depriving the world of one of its traditional growth engines.\n\nMore broadly, the shift is indicative of a world in which globalization is ebbing and geopolitical tensions are more likely to fester. \n\nDirect overseas investment from China to the rest of the world fell by 18% from a year earlier by one new measure released recently. The latest level marks a decline of 25% from a peak in 2016, as overseas mergers and acquisitions have plummeted and Beijing has tightened rules to curb capital flight. \n\n\nNew York City\u2019s Waldorf Astoria was sold to a Chinese insurer for $1.95 billion in 2015. PHOTO: KATHY WILLENS\/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDespite Beijing\u2019s easing of Covid-19 restrictions last year, China is unlikely to return to the heyday of overseas deal making, in large part because of rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and its allies, who according to analysts are blocking more Chinese investments on national security grounds.\n\nWithin China, a weakening currency, the struggling private sector and Beijing\u2019s growing focus on building up its domestic economy to enhance China\u2019s self-sufficiency will also damp its investment outflows, the analysts added.\n\n\u201cBy and large, the room for China to channel investment to foreign advanced economies is shrinking,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings. It is unlikely that China\u2019s overseas investment flows will increase significantly in the next three to five years, he said.\n\nInstead, China will likely realign investments to cement its dominance in such sectors as renewable energy and electric vehicles. That likely means doubling down on investment in emerging markets from Southeast Asia to the Middle East and Africa, as Chinese factory owners look for places to expand operations and find new customers, and Beijing focuses on markets rich in resources.\n\nThe Chinese automaker BYD said this month that it plans to invest more than $600 million in several car plants in Brazil. \n\n\u201cWhile Xi Jinping is alive, we are not going back to 2016,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, referring to the high-water mark of Chinese investment overseas. He said that while the U.S. economy isn\u2019t likely to miss Chinese capital too much, its retreat could be more painful for smaller Western economies such as Australia, Canada or Hungary.

But investors aren't buying. In fact, Blink shares have plunged this week, down about 13.4% as of early Friday afternoon, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSo what\nThe electric vehicle (EV) charging-equipment company announced a new two-year contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) yesterday. Blink will supply EV charging equipment, including Level 2 and DC fast chargers for both public and commercial fleet applications.\n\nEarlier in the week, blink also announced an agreement with Arcos Dorados, a company that operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean. The largest McDonald's franchisee in the world will use Blink's EV charging solutions for five McDonald's restaurants it owns in Puerto Rico. \n\nBut there's another elephant in the room that EV charging-network investors are watching and that likely has contributed to Blink's shares hitting a 3-year low this week. \n\nNow what\nEV leader Tesla has been signing deals with a growing number of EV makers to open up its supercharging network to non-Tesla vehicles. Now stock analysts are starting to put a valuation on that portion of its business, and investors are likely thinking that will be business taken from other EV charging-network companies. \n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives looked at the potential for Tesla's Supercharger network and told clients he believes it will represent as much as $10 billion to $20 billion in revenue by 2030. That would be a lot of potentially lost business especially considering that Blink expects 2023 revenue of between $110 million and $120 million. \n\nBlink Charging is also not yet profitable and doesn't expect to be until at least the end of next year. That has some speculative EV investors moving investments elsewhere this week. \n\nBefore you invest in Blink Charging...\nWhat if we told you that you could be getting more for your money?\n\nThere are plenty of good stocks out there.

{"text":"Yellow Corp. (NASDAQ: YELL) has failed to make its required pension contributions for June and is planning to withhold payments for July. The pension funds, pension accruals and health care coverage for workers will suspend on Sunday, according to a statement by the Teamsters. \n\nThe Teamsters union has threatened to strike by Monday if this is not resolved and the pension contributions remain in default. The company owes $50 million, a large sum for a company in financial distress. Yellow currently has in excess of $100 million in cash reserves, according to an 8-K filed on July 7. \n\nIf a strike comes to pass, this would likely be the end for the storied less-than-truckload carrier. \n\nWhile there is a lot of noise around the Yellow story, one thing is clear: Management is aware of the risks of not paying into the pension fund. They would have only missed a pension payment out of dire necessity, not convenience. \n\nAfter all, this is not an Elon Musk-style default \u2014 \u201cI am not going to pay this because I don\u2019t want to\u201d \u2014 but rather a decision that is borne out of a lack of sufficient funds to cover the payments. \n\nYellow\u2019s management likely knew that not paying the funds would force the Teamsters\u2019 hands. Perhaps they were hoping for a last-minute government bailout and decided that not paying the pension payment would allow for a few more weeks of liquidity until that bailout came.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the reason for the company\u2019s decision not to pay, it knew that defaulting would breach its contract with the Teamsters and that it would face retaliation from a battle-ready leader in Sean O\u2019Brien. \n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s public statements and Twitter feed would suggest he is ready for a Yellow bankruptcy. On June 24, he posted a photo on Twitter \u2014 he goes by @TeamsterSOB \u2014 of a tombstone with Yellow\u2019s name and the dates 1924-2023. \n\n\nO\u2019Brien, a regular Twitter poster, last tweeted about Yellow on June 27. Since then, his feed has been dedicated to UPS. \n\nIf O\u2019Brien has written off the 22,000 Teamster jobs at Yellow, you can bet that there is little hope for the company\u2019s future. \n\nWhat Yellow customers can do\nYellow\u2019s customers have options, however. \n\nAccording to channel checks conducted by FreightWaves, many of Yellow\u2019s shipping customers have been preparing for the prospect of a shutdown, but not all have not acted upon it as of yet. This will likely change this week. \n\n\nSupply chain decision-makers would be wise to consider an alternative to Yellow as soon as possible. No shipping customer wants to be caught in a Yellow shutdown; there is a big chance that shippers won\u2019t see their freight for months \u2014 if ever. \n\nOnce a strike takes place, Yellow\u2019s revenue would drop to almost zero, as almost all of its revenue is dependent upon union labor. And it is unlikely that it could recover, short of an improbable government bailout. The cash burn would be insurmountable and the company would be forced into bankruptcy within days or weeks. \n\nFreight tendered this week that is still in Yellow\u2019s network would likely be abandoned at terminal locations across the country. These terminals would be unsecure and attractive locations for criminals to target, especially after a few weeks. \n\nYellow\u2019s terminal real estate is pledged to the bondholders. They would be responsible for liquidating the real estate portfolio. It could take months. The agencies that are responsible for liquidation are not going to concern themselves with freight that is left behind in Yellow\u2019s network. \n\nLinehauls won\u2019t be moving freight between terminals. There is a chance that outside contractors that are part of Yellow\u2019s linehaul network would hold freight hostage, demanding some form of payment for services rendered.  \n\nFor shipping customers, customer service jobs would likely be eliminated almost immediately and there would be no chance of getting in touch with anyone to help sort out where the freight is, much less recover it. And worst of all, there will be no one to file a claim at the carrier. Even if by some miracle you were able to do so, you would be an unsecured creditor with an infinitely small chance of recovering anything in a liquidation. \n\n\nWhile no one likes to see a storied company shutter or 30,000 people lose their jobs, a Yellow shutdown would happen at a time when the trucking industry could absorb the volume. The trucking economy is very weak right now. Capacity is abundant and Yellow\u2019s competitors have been preparing for its failure for the past few months. \n\nEven if LTL networks get stretched (Yellow represents an estimated 10% of the total LTL volume), shippers will find plenty of linehaul capacity to purchase from the truckload industry. This could provide a welcome catalyst for Yellow\u2019s competitors and the truckload sector. \n\nMarket volatility is likely to be a factor. Yellow largely relied upon its own Teamsters power to run linehaul services between terminals. The loss of this capacity could play havoc on the broader freight network for a few months as routing guides get reset. ","labels":["financial_distress","supplychain"]}
{"text":"An outbreak of Ebola in Uganda is proving more difficult to deal with than more recent epidemics, with its recent spread to the capital city, Kampala, causing particular concern.\n\nSo far 75 cases have been confirmed in four provinces, though it is feared that there could be many more which were not detected before the victims were buried.\n\nWhat is Ebola?\nIt is a deadly virus with initial symptoms which can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat.\n\nSubsequent stages can include vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding, known as haemorrhaging.\n\n\nThe incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Symptoms of Ebola can sometimes be confused with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.\n\nWhy is this outbreak so serious?\nThe virus has been circulating in rural parts of Uganda since September but an outbreak in an urban area - like Kampala - is much more complex to deal with.\n\nThe population density and ease of mobility, including internationally, means the virus can easily travel through an infected but asymptomatic patient within a short period of time.\n\nHowever an asymptomatic person cannot transmit the virus. Speed is of the essence when tracing contacts of known cases, isolating and monitoring them for at least the 21-day incubation period of the virus.\n\nThe cooperation of such contacts with response teams is also crucial. The infection in Kampala has been traced to a contact of a confirmed case who reportedly travelled to the capital under a disguised identity.\n\nHe tried to seek help from a traditional healer before turning to a hospital where he was admitted, but later succumbed to the illness.\n\nSeven members of one family he had come into contact with got infected.\n\nEbola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated items or environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.\n\nThe Health Ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where the bodies were buried before they could be tested.\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the numbers of deaths given by Uganda's government and WHO figures, because the latter is counting the 18 probable Ebola deaths, whereas Kampala is only including deaths where Ebola has been confirmed.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.\n\nIs there a vaccine?\nAnother concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain.\n\nThe Health Ministry has said three candidate vaccines from Oxford, Sabin and Merck will be trialled for efficacy \"in coming weeks\". Several treatment options are also being tested, said Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng.\n\n\nEbola vaccines developed in the last few years have not been tested on the Sudan strain\nThe Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.\n\nWith more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.\n\nTwo years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.\n\nA second vaccine by Johnson & Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nBut neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.\n\nNonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni had previously said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.\n\nHow is Uganda dealing with the outbreak?\nThe focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.\n\nTreatment and isolation facilities have been set up in the affected districts. Their capacity is being ramped up as the virus spreads.\n\nMobile laboratories were also deployed, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.\n\nMedics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for stricter measures including more lockdowns of areas with confirmed cases.\n\nPresident Museveni initially ruled out such restrictions, saying: \"Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]\" as it is not an airborne disease.\n\nHe said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact.\n\nThe government later relented and placed the two districts at the centre of the outbreak under lockdown.\n\n\"We believe transmission may have been disrupted,\" said the Health Ministry as there had been no secondary cases of infection since the lockdown. However, no such restrictions have been imposed in Kampala.\n\nHow does Ebola spread?\nEbola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.\n\nBushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.\n\nIt then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.\n\nMen who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery.\n\nWhat precautions can be taken?\nTo prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.\n\nIt is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\nQuarantines have been ruled out\nIn eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected.\n\nHowever, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection.\n\nBodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial.\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

Back in July, I wrote an article on Apple in which I highlighted the company's vulnerabilities in China and how Beijing is using some of them to leverage its relationship with the most valuable company in the world and the U.S. in particular.\n\nSince that time, Apple has undertaken several notable relocations, which could help it to ease some of the risks. First of all, the company has expanded its presence in Vietnam, and India, and continues to look for new partners in the Southeast Asian region where it could utilize low-wage labor to ensure that its margins are not severely affected when moving some of the supply chains to new countries.\n\nSecondly, Tim Cook's recent statement inside the new chip factory of Taiwanese company TSMC (TSM) in Arizona about the production of Apple-designed chips there starting from 2024 also makes it possible for the company to mitigate risks that are associated with Beijing's potential invasion of Taiwan in the future.\n\nWhile it's too soon to talk about full decoupling from China, as Apple continues to heavily rely on production within the country to this day, the latest developments indicate that the company is finally taking the threats that come from China seriously. Even though investors could see some of the company's costs rising in the foreseeable future, the diversification of supply chains ensures that Apple is able to survive and thrive in case of a further confrontation between Beijing and Washington.\n\nAs Apple diversifies, this article aims at highlighting the potential challenges that the company could face and how it could affect its performance in years to come.\n\nThe New Geopolitical Reality\nIn the last two years, Apple has been slowly decreasing its reliance on China. If in 2020, the company's exposure to the country's supply chains was 42%, then in 2021 that percentage decreased to 35.9%. Even though that's not enough to mitigate any major geopolitical disruptions, even such a decrease indicates that the company's management and Tim Cook in particular, who started building the existing supply chains during the Steve Jobs era, understands that it's no longer safe to over-rely on China in our current day and age no more.\n\nOne of the reasons for that is the inability to predict the direction in which Beijing will take the country. In one of my articles on Alibaba (BABA), I've already explained how the sacking of market reformists from the Standing Committee along with Xi Jinping, who has been reelected for an unprecedented third term as the General Secretary of the CCP, against the West makes China an unreliable partner for foreigners. Add to this the fact that the latest decision of the Biden administration to apply new export controls on advanced chips to China and a subsequent decision of Beijing to request opening a panel at the WTO against the U.S. have reignited the ongoing trade war and it becomes obvious that the improvement of Sino-American relations won't happen anytime soon. We already see that the U.S. manufacturing orders from China are now down 40%, which is a sign that things won't return to what we know as normal anytime soon.\n\nThe good news is that it appears that Apple is on its way to mitigating some of the risks of Beijing's foreign and domestic policy at the same time. Considering that there's constantly a possibility that Beijing decides to invade Taiwan by the end of this decade, it made sense for Apple's foundry partner TSMC to start building a plant in a safe location such as Arizona where the disruptions to its production of chips would be minimal. The appearance of Tim Cook along with President Biden earlier this month during the 'tool-in' ceremony of the upcoming TSMC plant in Arizona and the announcement of the production of Apple's chips on American soil starting in 2024 is a good way to ensure that the company's advanced chips won't be hostages to Beijing's foreign policy in the future.\n\nAt the same time, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that after the latest protests against the zero-Covid policy in Zhengzhou, which primarily affected the production of iPhones, Apple accelerated the process of looking for ways to outsource its production to other countries such as India and Vietnam. While the process is still ongoing, the analysts at JPMorgan (JPM) believe that by 2025 every fourth iPhone will be made in India, which is a sign that Apple started to take the risks of overexposing the production to a single country more seriously in recent months and finally is moving in the right direction after years of complacency.\n\nThe biggest upside in all of this is that with close to $50 billion in cash reserves and a decent debt profile, Apple could afford to move its production to other countries, which can't be said the same about other smaller businesses that are in the same position as the Cupertino-based tech giant.\n\nThe Upcoming Challenges\nWhile it makes sense for Apple to decrease its overexposure to China and mitigate some of the geopolitical risks, the company nevertheless is unlikely to fully decouple from the country anytime soon. The first major reason for it is the fact that China has become its third biggest consumer market after the Americas and Europe. Out of the $394.3 billion in net sales that Apple generated in FY22, $74.2 billion came from China. A potential loss of such a big consumer market in case of a potential direct confrontation between Beijing and Washington is certainly going to hurt.\n\nConsidering that the Pentagon in its latest National Security Strategy report noted that China is the only competitor that has the intent and capacity to reshape the global order, it becomes obvious that a potential direct confrontation in the future is more than possible whether we or Apple like it or not.\n\nHowever, even if we assume that the worst that could happen is simply a major decoupling of China and the U.S. from each other, Apple would nevertheless is more than likely to take a major financial hit even from such an outcome.\n\nOne of the main reasons for it is the fact that there's no guarantee that Apple would be able to keep its margins and expenses at the current levels if it outsources most of its production to other countries. A few years ago, a Chinese expert Doug Guthrie, who has been hired by Apple to help the company navigate within China, came to the conclusion that neither India nor Vietnam are viable replacements due to a bureaucracy that made it complicated to build infrastructure and production plants.\n\nIt's been a few years since he came to such a conclusion, so there's a chance that things have improved and Apple nevertheless manages to relocate the production without significantly hurting its margins or increasing its expenses. However, what we do know though is that it's more than likely that Apple would continue to postpone the release of future products such as its own electric car until it mitigates a significant portion of the geopolitical risks.\n\nAnother problem that the company is facing is the inability to significantly accelerate the outsourcing of production to other countries. Bloomberg estimates that it would take 8 years to outsource only 10% of its production capacity, which is likely to be too late for it to avoid becoming a casualty of a possible upcoming economic Sino-American confrontation, as a potential escalation of the ongoing trade war would more than likely impact its revenues and inflate the costs.\n\nLet's not forget that back in 2019, Apple managed to dodge some of the tariffs only due to the trade agreement between China and the U.S., which nevertheless hasn't fully ended a trade war at that time. With Sino-American relations being at historically low levels, the possibility of having a similar agreement in case of further escalation remains dim.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it becomes clear that Apple is more than likely to face tough following years as it tries to mitigate all the geopolitical risks at once. To figure out whether Apple's shares have any upside given the latest developments, I've updated my DCF model, which could be seen below.\n\nIn the base case scenario, the top-line growth assumptions are in-line with the street estimates, while most other assumptions are either averages of previous years or in-line with the latest reported period. As for the change in net working capital, it represents only 1% of revenues in the following years solely due to the fact that in previous years it fluctuated much and can't be fully predicted going forward. The terminal growth rate in the model remained at 3%, while WACC has been increased to 8.5% due to the rising interest rates.\n\nThe model shows that under normal conditions, Apple's implied fair value is $126.73 per share, which represents a downside from the current levels. While such a price is below the consensus price of $172.51 per share, it's nevertheless above the lowest street price target of $118 per share. At the same time, Seeking Alpha's Quant system gives Apple an F rating for valuation.\n\nConsidering that this is a base case scenario where Apple's operations are not disrupted, it's safe to say that any downsides that come with the relocation of production or any risks that could materialize due to Beijing's domestic or foreign policy have all the chances to negatively affect the company's valuation even more.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nIn the last couple of decades, Apple has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalization, as the high-tech chip designs of Silicon Valley coupled with the low-wage labor of China made it possible for the company to disrupt several industries, enrich its shareholders, and become the most valuable company in the world along the way. As globalization unravels, Apple is racing against time to decrease its exposure from China in order to mitigate any major geopolitical risks, secure its supply chains, and ensure its own survival in case the relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate even more and lead to a potential direct confrontation in the future.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Apple would succeed in its endeavor, as the decoupling from China creates not only opportunities but its own challenges as well. However, there's no doubt that the sooner Apple stops over-relying on a single party, the better the chances that it would be able to stay afloat and not be too exposed to the changing geopolitical landscape.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}
{"text":"After years of rampant growth, payment service Mollie is implementing its first reorganization and layoffs, founder Adriaan Mol confirmed to the Financieele Dagblad. He spoke of a relatively minor intervention, affecting less than 10 percent of Mollie\u2019s about 800 employees.\n\n\u201cThis is a consequence of the realization that our company has grown too quickly. We hired too many people in a short time and went too far. The company is no longer efficient,\u201d Mol said. The FinTech company informed its employees about the upcoming layoffs about a week and a half ago, he said. The works council, the benefits agency UWV, and the supervisory authority De Nederlandsche Bank were also informed.\n\nDiscussions are taking place with the affected employees, the company told ANP.\n\nIt is the first time that Mollie has distanced itself from its aggressive growth plans. The move illustrates a turnaround in the FinTech sector. Companies now have to pay more attention to costs as investors no longer consider FinTech as the big promise solution for all future problems, according to the newspaper. \u201cThe future looks very different than everyone thought two years ago,\u201d Mol told FD.\n\nThat became very clear last month when sector darling Adyen lost half of its stock market value in a few days after announcing disappointing figures.\n\nMollie recorded a net loss of 121.5 million euros in 2022, 70 percent more than the previous year. The company struggled with rapidly increasing personnel costs. According to Mol, the company is cutting some intermediate layers in its organizational structure and intervening in the commercial department. The customer research department may also be affected by redundancies. \u201cWe are organizing the company differently and preparing for the next phase of growth,\u201d Mol told FD.\n\nThings have been restless at Mollie for some time. The CEO and CFO left in a short period, followed by changes in the supervisory board. When asked about complaints on online platforms, Mol denied that the company board lacks vision and that there is a toxic work environment. \u201cThe organization has become flatter, with more individual responsibility,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIf you ask me, I would say that the culture has actually improved.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress"]}

A red pickup is in the foreground.\nFord Motor sales nudged up in January from a year earlier, with electric vehicles leading the way.Credit...Cydni Elledge for The New York Times\n\nFord Motor said on Thursday that it lost $2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.\n\nThe company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $2.8 billion last year. Ford said on Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.\n\nThe automaker said its revenue had risen about 16 percent, to $158 billion, mainly because of higher car prices. The company sold 4.2 million vehicles worldwide, up from 3.9 million in 2021.\n\nFord has long struggled to reduce defects and recalls in its cars and trucks. Recalls can be expensive and time consuming, and company executives said on Thursday that they were working to improve the reliability of their vehicles.\n\n\u201cIn simple terms, we need to improve quality and lower costs now,\u201d the company\u2019s chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call.\n\nThe Rise of Electric Vehicles\nSearching for a Rental: A New York Times reporter was determined to rent an electric vehicle for environmental reasons.

Ford\u2019s revenue in the final three months of 2022 rose 17 percent, to $44 billion.\n\nThe company sold 1.15 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.1 million a year earlier but about 500,000 fewer than Ford had expected, Mr. Lawler said.\n\nFord\u2019s production has been slowed by the global shortage of computer chips, and Mr. Lawler said the company expected some disruptions to continue this year and a slight increase in production volume.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, there is still going to be volatility on chips,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the older chips used in the auto industry, there is still capacity constraint.\u201d\n\nFord said it expected this year\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\nShares of Ford stock were down about 7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Ford said that its sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2 percent in January and that its sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.\n\nThe automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, up from 142,445 in January 2022, when a shortage of computer chips slowed production and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of January, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier, a strong signal that supply chain problems were easing.\n\nModels responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, the Bronco sport utility vehicle and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V.s, up 11 percent.\n\nFord halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitl\u00e1n, just north of Mexico City, to increase output.

{"text":"Amazon and companies it contracts to deliver packages across the country are facing a rash of lawsuits alleging they failed to pay drivers the minimum wage and overtime and provide mandated rest and meal breaks under pressure to complete Amazon deliveries on time.\n\nIn late February, Amazon delivery drivers working for eight contractors in the Seattle area in Washington State received notices that they'd won $8.2 million in a class action settlement for wage violations, according to a court settlement notice that will go before a judge in May 2021 for final approval.\n\n\nThe class action lawsuit was filed in Washington state in 2017 by two Amazon delivery drivers, Gus Ortiz and Mark Fredley, who alleged that an Amazon delivery company called Jungle Trux required them to deliver between 150 and 200 packages a day and failed to provide legally mandated rest and lunch breaks, and refused to pay drivers for those missed breaks. \n\nCourt and government documents show that these wage theft violations impacting Amazon's delivery drivers were rampant across the United States between 2017 and 2020. Last week, the state of California fined Amazon $6.4 million for failing to pay overtime and offer rest breaks to 700 contracted delivery drivers in Southern California between 2018 and 2020. In 2019, Amazon delivery drivers in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey won $1.8 million in unpaid wages. \n\n\u201cAmazon does not tolerate violations of labor laws,\" Leah Seay, an Amazon spokesperson told Motherboard. \"Where we find repeated violations, or an inability to correct labor violations, we terminate contracts with DSP program participants.\u201d\n\nThough Amazon's delivery drivers operate Amazon-emblazoned vans, wear Amazon uniforms, and are trained by Amazon employees, they are technically not employed directly by Amazon but by small contractors, known as \"delivery service partners,\" that operate out of Amazon warehouses around the country. \n\nAmazon has been sued in many of these wage theft cases, as lawsuits claim that Amazon serves as a joint employer of its delivery drivers because of the extensive control it exerts over them. \"Amazon [is responsible for] virtually every aspect of [drivers'] jobs, including the existence of the job itself,\" the Washington State lawsuit against Amazon and eight of its contractors reads. \n\nCollectively, the lawsuits repeat similar stories of how Amazon lacked a streamlined process for paying drivers and under financial pressure from Amazon, delivery companies frequently broke the law in order to squeeze productivity out of their drivers. Many Amazon delivery companies earn revenue based on whether packages get delivered successfully on time (undelivered packages are known as \"concessions.\")\n\nThe lawsuits allege that between 2018 and mid-2020, Amazon's delivery drivers were frequently paid daily rates, such as $135 a day, to deliver packages for 10 hours. But because of high delivery quotas, drivers often worked more than 11 continuous hours, not pausing for legally-mandated lunch and rest breaks. \n\nEven after drivers had finished delivering the packages in their vans, drivers are frequently asked by dispatchers to \"rescue\" other drivers, according to the lawsuits. Though they qualified for overtime, Amazon's delivery companies did not pay drivers for extra hours spent on the road. Often this meant drivers earned less than the minimum wage. To make matters worse, delivery companies often did not track how many hours their drivers had worked. \n\nAmazon is currently battling at least four class action lawsuits in Texas, Ohio, Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Florida, Illinois, and Maryland, according to legal documents reviewed by Motherboard on Pacer, the federal database of court cases. \n\nFlorida driver Andrea Thomas \"was paid $130 per scheduled ten-hour shift and she was not paid an overtime premium, despite regularly working 50-60 hours or more per week,\" the complaint for an ongoing lawsuit against Amazon and a delivery company called JSTC in Melbourne, Florida, reads.   \n\nAnother ongoing lawsuit alleges an Amazon delivery company called Sheard Loman Transport, operating out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, terminated Heather Gongaware, a dispatcher in 2018 who threatened legal action for not receiving overtime pay and organized with her colleagues on the app GroupMe. At the time, the owner of the company fired her and told her \"she was being terminated for discussing legal options for recovering unpaid overtime with other drivers,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"I never filled out a timesheet. The manager did it for us,\" a former Amazon delivery driver who worked for Jungle Trux in 2018 in the Seattle area, and received a legal notice in February that he was eligible for part of the Washington state settlement, told Motherboard. The amount each driver receives from the settlement will depend on how long they worked. The former delivery driver said he received a notice that he will receive $1,000 for work between October 2018 and November 2019. Motherboard granted him anonymity because he feared retaliation from Amazon. \n\nJungle Trux's attorneys did not respond to Motherboard's request for comment.  \n\nUnder the Federal Labor Standards Act of 1938, companies must guarantee their employees overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week, even when workers are paid daily rates. In many states, workers also must receive unpaid meal breaks and paid rest breaks on their shifts, and must be paid at least the minimum hourly wage, including if it falls below the day rate. \n\nIn 2018, Amazon launched its delivery service partner program, which was designed to allow small businesses, capped at 40 vans, to operate out of Amazon warehouses and employ their own delivery drivers. This program allowed Amazon to rapidly scale up its last mile delivery network to offer free one-day shipping for Amazon Prime members, while shirking financial and legal responsibility for maintaining vehicles and paying and providing benefits and protections to drivers who deliver its packages under exhausting conditions. \"[In the early days], it was like the Wild West,\" the former Amazon delivery driver from Washington said. \n\nIn California, the recent state investigation that resulted in $6.4 million in penalties found that between April 2017 and January 2020, drivers at a Amazon delivery service partner Green Messengers who were scheduled to work 10-hour days often worked 11 or more hours to complete their routes\u2014resulting in minimum wage violations, unpaid overtime, and missed rest and meal break violations. Amazon and its affiliated delivery company's fine amounts to $7,388 per worker, though some of these penalties will be paid to the state. \n\nThe California Labor Commissioner is investigating an independent business we previously partnered with,\" Leah Seay, the Amazon spokesperson told Motherboard. \"We were not aware of the investigation and are appealing the citation.\u201d\n\nAmazon did not respond to a question from Motherboard about whether all its delivery companies have switched from daily to hourly rates paid but told Motherboard that its contracts with all of their delivery companies now require that they track and pay for hours worked.\n\nAn Amazon delivery driver organizer and delivery company owner told Motherboard that in 2020 many delivery companies transitioned away from paying daily rates to a streamlined process that requires hourly rates and an electronic timekeeping systems, such as ADP and Paycom. An organizer in Southern California, told Motherboard that they hadn't seen local Amazon delivery companies pay workers day rates for a year. Motherboard agreed to keep these sources anonymous because they feared retaliation. The company owner in Washington state said electronic time-keeping is now required of delivery companies in his region and paying drivers daily rates has been banned. These new policies, they say, have helped resolve wage theft problems by requiring workers to clock in and out every time they work.\n\nDo you have a tip to share with us about working for an Amazon DSP? We\u2019d love to hear from you. Please get in touch with the author Lauren via email lauren.gurley@vice.com or on Signal 201-897-2109.\n\nThe Philadelphia class action law firm, Berger Montague, which has at least three open wage theft cases against Amazon around the country, has an open nationwide call for Amazon delivery drivers who believe they are owed back wages from Amazon and delivery service partners.

{"text":"BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Belgium has raised a record 21.9 billion euros ($23.65 bln) from savers in a bond sale designed to compete with bank deposits, a sign of growing popularity for government debt as discontent grows with lenders failing to keep up with surging interest rates.\n\nThe sale, launched on Aug. 24, was aimed at pressuring banks to raise deposit rates. It marks the biggest funding drive from households in Belgium's history and is likely Europe's biggest retail bond sale, the country's debt agency said on Monday.\n\nEquivalent to around 5% of Belgian deposits, it eclipses the 5.7 billion euros raised from savers at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011 and beats the 18 billion euros Italy raised from savers earlier this year.\n\nEuropean lenders awash with cash have resisted raising savings rates while market interest rates have surged as central banks fight inflation, prompting withdrawals by households looking for better returns.\n\nBonds issued by governments targeted at savers have become a popular alternative. Italy and Portugal have this year shifted big slices of their funding programmes to households.\n\nThe scale of demand for the bond was \"a clear signal for the banks,\" Belgian finance minister Vincent Van Peteghem told Reuters, adding he had never expected the sale to prove so popular.\n\n\"Savers are giving a signal to their banks to say: we are expecting a higher return than the one that you are offering nowadays on your savings accounts. We ask at least the same respect that you have for your shareholders,\" he said.\n\nBelgium's one-year bond pays an interest rate of 3.3%, above the 2.5% and often much lower rates on savings accounts, according to aggregator website Spaargids.\n\nIT CRASH\nJean Deboutte, a director at the debt agency, said high demand led to its IT systems crashing several times during the sale.\n\n\"At one point in time we had one subscription per second.\" he said. \"That's a figure one would find with Amazon.\"\n\nAcross Europe, governments are seeking ways to compensate households taking a blow from the surging cost of living while missing out on the benefit of rising interest rates.\n\nItaly recently dealt a blow to banks with a one-off tax on their excess profits.\n\nWhile demand for the bond is high, the country's biggest lenders are yet to raise rates paid on savings accounts.\n\n\"It is now up to every bank individually to see which impact this had on their bank,\" Belgian financial sector lobby Febelfin spokesperson Isabelle Marchand said.\n\n\"This will be different for every bank, but the financial stability of every bank needs to be monitored closely.\"\n\nNoting that some institutions have raised rates or offered similar products since the bond sale, Van Peteghem said he hoped and expected bigger banks would now follow.\n\n\"If that's not happening that means that we still need to look for other tools.

Blizzard conditions engulfed Western New York around 8:45 a.m. on Friday, December 23 and lasted until Tuesday, December 27. \n\nOn Christmas, the storm shifted from a blizzard to a lake effect snow event. \n\nThe 33-page report, released by NYSDHSES, stated that 50 interviews were conducted and over 1,300 pages of relevant documents were reviewed. \n\nThe report highlighted poor communication, language and coordination as areas that impacted the states response. \n\nIt also points to the public underestimating the severity of the storm. \n\n\"When the storm that would become the Blizzard of \u201922 was initially forecast, it is possible that some WNY residents underestimated the need to prepare, given the recent relative ease of storm experience in November 2022,\" the report said. \n\nRegarding communication, the report highlights that the state did not use its NY-Alert system \"due to a low subscriber base.\"\n\nNY-Alert is a platform that users can receive emergency alerts from the state via phone, email, text or fax. \n\nOther communication that needs review is the way state agencies phrased announcements to the public. For example, the report highlights a communication by the NYSDOT for motorists to \"heed all warnings.\"\n\n\"A reference to 'heed all warnings' could have been enhanced by referring to the specific rules in place at that time,\" the report said. \n\nThe issue of the travel ban was a topic conversation and finger pointing in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The state report doesn't outright indicate a state travel ban should have been initiated earlier, but rather points to the evolving forecast as the reason why it wasn't.  \n\n\"This ban was enacted after inclement conditions appeared in the early morning, instead of Friday afternoon as the State planned for based on Thursday night\u2019s forecast. The midmorning travel ban meant that some drivers were still on the roads or had planned to be on the roads that day \u2013 even as the weather quickly deteriorated.\"\n\n\nAccording to the report, various state agencies rescued 649 people from the roads at the height of the blizzard. One recommendation in the report is for more state roads installing barriers. \n\n\"The State should consider the feasibility of adding additional barriers on roads that do not already have them, to allow for greater enforcement of travel bans.\"\n\nState officials did cite that Erie County was not using a current version of standard emergency management software. The report states that \"there were still usability challenges for response staff\" because the county uses an older version. \n\nErie County executive Mark Poloncarz rebuffed that conclusion in the report and said that \"there are no compatibility issues.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to 2 On Your Side, the county executive said:\n\n\"Erie County was proud to participate in New York State's After Action Report of the Christmas Blizzard by providing full access to all key county personnel involved in the storm response. We will be incorporating any relevant findings into our very active winter storm preparation process that is already well underway.\"\n\nBuffalo Mayor Brown, or anyone else from the administration, was unavailable for an interview regarding the report. Mayor Brown's office sent a statement saying:\n\n\"The Mayor is aware the State's After Action Report for the response to the December Blizzard is completed. City staff participated in the process as requested and we are currently reviewing the document. As previously announced, the City has established a Storm Response Task Force and has already purchased new equipment and adopted new storm-fighting procedures.\"\n\nOverall the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services didn't give itself a passing or failing grade in regards to their response to the blizzard. But the state acknowledges areas where agencies are working in silos and more collaboration is needed. \n\n\n\"The system cannot improve in isolation. Going forward, state agency partners, along with local officials should work towards an improved state emergency management through intentional communication.\"","labels":["natural_disasters"]}

The company initially called the situation \u201can incident\" and said that \"no customer funds were lost.\" Hackers stole 4,836.26 ETH, roughly $13 million, 443.93 BTC, roughly $16 million, and about $66,200-worth of other currencies.

Some are allegedly members of the notorious SilverTerrier BEC group. BEC is a dominant type of online scamming in which attackers use lookalike email accounts, fake personas, and phishing to trick businesses into sending money to the wrong places. Often this is done by compromising an email account within a target organization to make a ruse look more legitimate. Interpol said this week that after evaluating the devices of the 11 suspects, it has linked them to scams that victimized more than 50,000 targets.

{"text":"Easing supply-chain pressures haven\u2019t come fast enough to pull the maker of the popular Instant Pot cooker and Pyrex glassware out of a financial tailspin brought on by pandemic-driven turmoil. \n\nInstant Brands filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month with its balance sheet crumpled by the high costs of keeping its supply chain running even as demand for its products, standbys in many American kitchens, soared and then slumped in rapidly changing consumer markets. \n\nThe company is seeking to restructure debt that includes tens of millions of dollars owed to manufacturers in China and some $320,000 to various unnamed logistics providers, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. It lists United Parcel Service, to which it owes $802,274, and Packaging Corp. of America, at $765,167, among its top 30 unsecured creditors. \n\nThe company said in its filing that it faced \u201cunprecedented liquidity challenges, which have accelerated dramatically over the past months driven by severely tightened credit terms with suppliers, rising interest rates, continued inflation and a shifting in Instant Brands\u2019 historical distribution channels in North America, while supply chain issues persisted.\u201d\n\nThe Logistics Report\n\nTop news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.\n\nSupply-chain experts said Instant Brands\u2019 woes show how many retailers and manufacturers, particularly smaller operators without big capital cushions, are still coping with the financial overhang of the turmoil during the pandemic. International shipping costs, for instance, surged some 10-fold in 2021 from prepandemic levels and have only receded this year. \n\nRetailers have a lot of inventory that they purchased and imported at high rates and have shipping contracts negotiated during a period of high prices, \u201cso that now maybe some of the cost increases are starting to come through,\u201d said Lisa Ellram, a supply-chain management professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nThe Downers Grove, Ill.-based company\u2019s Instant Pot became a hit early in the pandemic as locked-down Americans turned to the all-in-one kitchen gadget to cook more meals at home. \n\nBut consumer demand shifted just as port closures, shipping backlogs and soaring freight costs tangled the company\u2019s supply chain. As overstuffed freight transportation channels started to crack and delays spread, lead times for ordering everything from raw materials to finished goods lengthened. Instant Brands said in its filing that it ordered parts further in advance and raised its prices to help offset those costs, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2021, a supply chain perfect storm unfolded,\u201d the company said in its bankruptcy filing. \n\nInstant Brands faced more challenges last year as retailers, overstocked with items consumers no longer wanted, slashed orders. The company cut its own production orders, raised prices and trimmed operating costs at least four times over the past three years, but still faced \u201csignificant pressure\u201d on its balance sheet, according to court filings. \n\n\nPyrex is one of Instant Brands well-known kitchen supplies. PHOTO: RICHARD B. LEVINE\/ZUMA PRESS\nMarko Bastl, director of Marquette University\u2019s Center for Supply Chain Management, said many of the companies that made goods in anticipation of strong consumer demand today are coping with higher inventory carrying costs since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates early last year. \n\n\u201cRetailers will stockpile finished product, and distributors for example and manufacturers will stockpile their input materials, and many of them are really, really hurting now that we are coming slowly out of the pandemic and demand has shifted again,\u201d Bastl said. \u201cGiven the increased interest rates and so on, their balance sheets are badly hurt.\u201d\n\nInstant Brands said in its bankruptcy court filing that it owes sourced finished goods vendors about $41.3 million, specialty material vendors about $8.4 million, and foreign vendors\u2014including its Chinese manufacturers\u2014about $45.3 million.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - A federal jury found in favor of a man who claimed that he had been discriminated against by two Omaha-based truck-driving companies because he was deaf.\n\nAccording to a report last week from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the jury awarded Victor Robinson $75,000 compensation and $36 million in punitive damages from Werner Enterprises and its subsidiary, Drivers Management, after deliberating for two hours.\n\n\u201cThe jury heard the evidence and called Werner\u2019s conduct what it was \u2014 unacceptable,\u201d Andrea G.

{"text":"Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride over the last few years. All cryptocurrency is volatile with a track record of \u201cboom and bust\u201c cycles that have left many wondering whether it\u2019s safe to invest. We explain reasons for bitcoin\u2019s latest price action, along with the 2022 crypto market crash.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, dropped below $16,000 in November 2022, a year after it reached a record high of $69,000.\n\nThings started looking up in 2023, with bitcoin\u2019s price climbing above $30,000 in April. However, a rout in August wiped nearly all the gains made in the months prior. At one point the asset\u2019s price briefly fell to as low as around $25,200, down from July\u2019s high of $31,814.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind bitcoin\u2019s recent price action, and what might the future hold for the market?\n\nIn this article we explain:\n\n\nWhat is happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nWhy is the price of bitcoin going down?\nWhy did bitcoin crash in 2022?\nWhy is bitcoin so volatile?\nWill bitcoin crash or go back up?\nWhat\u2019s happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nBitcoin is incredibly volatile. It is prone to rising and falling sharply on a daily basis.\n\nIn the second half of August, the price of bitcoin fell from over $30,000 to its current level of around $26,000. This marks a decrease of around 13%, which could prove catastrophic to those holding the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency to be experiencing a tumultuous period. Generally, bitcoin\u2019s price action reflects wider market trends, with alternative cryptocurrencies known as \u2018altcoins\u2019 having a tendency to suffer in tandem with it.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is currently trading at a price of around $1,640 a coin, 10% less than a week prior.\n\nWhy has the price of bitcoin gone down?\nIt\u2019s impossible to assign a single clear cause behind bitcoin\u2019s latest dip in price, but here are some possible reasons:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk\u2019s spacecraft manufacturing company, SpaceX, may have sold part or all of its bitcoin holdings\nAnalysts expect the American central bank to keep hiking interest rates. This will make borrowing more expensive and potentially hamper spending on cryptocurrency, with investors instead favouring safer, traditional savings routes\nEvergrande, a Chinese property development giant, has recently filed for bankruptcy. There are fears that due to the size of the firm, the collapse will send ripples through the Chinese economy and hamper confidence, lowering cryptocurrency investment\nWhile inflation has fallen in several developed countries, there are still fears that it could remain historically high for some time. This can have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending on cryptocurrency\nThe cryptocurrency market has begun to face regulation in several major countries including China and United States \u2013 and therefore a stricter framework of rules. This has seen cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bittrex forced to shut down.\nBut while regulation could harm cryptocurrency prices in the short term, stricter policing of the market may give consumers greater confidence over the long run, which could see the market stabilise\nIt\u2019s not just the cryptocurrency market suffering. Global stocks have gone into a downturn as result of:\n\nThe war in Ukraine\nInflationary fears\nHigher interest rates, which have made it more expensive for businesses to borrow money\nTurbulence in the stock market has spilled over into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIs a bitcoin crash coming, or will bitcoin go back up?\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to investing, especially with cryptocurrency. As quickly as bitcoin falls, it could just as rapidly climb again.\n\nThere are a number of concerns about cryptocurrencies that are dampening its prospects:\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges going bust\nCrackdowns and heightened regulation in countries like China, the United States and the United Kingdom\nCalls for greater regulation across the globe\nEnvironmental concerns\nSecurity issues and hacks\nThe price being based solely on speculation\nFurther regulation is seen as a threat to the decentralisation of crypto, which is having an impact on the prices of digital currencies.\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is taking steps to crack down on the cryptocurrency market. This includes forcing investors to wait 24 hours after depositing money into cryptocurrency exchanges before they can access it. Find out more about the FCA\u2019s crackdown on crypto.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s actions is indicative of a wider trend of governments across the world taking the risks of cryptocurrency more seriously. If further steps are taken by regulators, we could see a fall in investment as the potential for profit in the market declines.\n\nHowever, in the long run, heightened regulation may prove fruitful for the market. This is because consumers may grow more confident with a stronger framework of rules, and a fall in volatility within the crypto market may cause them to be less fearful of losing large amounts of money.\n\nWhat are the positives of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nBitcoin\u2019s fans point to other positive qualities:\n\nTransformative technology that could revolutionise industries\nSimpler and cheaper transactions by cutting out \u201cmiddle men\u201d such as banks\nEasier global trade because, with a non-fiat digital currency, there would be no concerns about exchange rates\nTransactions are more confidential\nIt is a  safe store of value because it can\u2019t be printed or seized\nBitcoin has been touted as an alternative to gold, meaning it could prove itself as a hedge against inflation\nGiven its volatile nature, it is possible that bitcoin will gather momentum again at some point in the future (perhaps weeks, months or even years down the line, or perhaps not at all).\n\nCryptocurrency proponents will point out that given bitcoin\u2019s previous meteoric rises, it cannot be ruled out that the same could happen again.\n\nBut no one has a crystal ball and the speculative nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to predict.\n\nFind out more about the tips (and mistakes to avoid) when investing with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat caused bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2022?\nIn March 2022, the price of one bitcoin was around $46,000. But the market turbulence that followed saw this drop by nearly two thirds.\n\nIn June 2022 bitcoin dropped below $20,000 for the first time since 2020. This was prompted by the decision of Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, to freeze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions.\n\nThe move fuelled a slump across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, the most significant blow for crypto in 2022 was triggered by the collapse of FTX in November. This was a major cryptocurrency exchange which handled around $1 billion transactions each day. Its collapse had a knock-on effect on other crypto exchanges. In November 2022, the price of bitcoin fell to around $16,000, a far cry from its peak of around $65,000 a year prior.\n\nChina\u2019s continued crackdown on crypto also played a role. Transacting with or trading major cryptocurrencies is illegal there, as is \u2018mining\u2019 bitcoin \u2013 the process via which bitcoin is obtained. Find out more about how cryptocurrency works.\n\nIn addition to this, 2022 saw sudden and severe sell-offs of major cryptocurrencies. This triggered panic and further sell-offs which has knocked consumer confidence.\n\nDespite 2022 being a torrid year for bitcoin, it has since recovered some of the ground it lost last year and is now worth around $26,000.\n\nWhat were the negative stories behind bitcoin\u2019s collapse?\nNegative stories\nA number of negative stories and threats of further regulation contributed to bitcoin\u2019s collapse in 2022.\n\nThese included:\n\nNovember 2022 cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bust\nJune 2022, Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, froze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions\nJune 2022, Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, paused bitcoin withdrawals, blaming a \u201cstuck transaction\u201d that was causing a backlog\nEarly 2022, reports that Russia might ban cryptocurrency operations.

Then in September 2021, all crypto transactions were declared illegal\nJune 2021, then US president Donald Trump described bitcoin as a \u201cscam\u201d competing against the dollar to be \u201cthe currency of the world\u201d\nFBI agents have seized millions of dollars in bitcoin from criminals over the years.\nAugust 2021, UK regulator the FCA in effect blacklisted Binance. Big banks such as HSBC and Santander blocked customers from making payments to Binance.\nAugust 2021, the International Monetary Fund warned the widespread use of crypto would threaten \u201cmacroeconomic stability\u201d and could harm financial integrity.\nWhat were the positive stories behind crypto\u2019s rise in 2021?\nThere have also been more positive stories and these have given the bitcoin price some protection over the past couple of years, as well as propelling bitcoin to its peak of around $65,000 in November 2021:\n\nMarch 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first big US bank to offer wealthier clients access to bitcoin funds \u2013 albeit restricted to no more than 2.5% of an investor\u2019s total net worth.\nJune 2021, a month after sparking a crypto sell-off, Elon Musk said Tesla would probably accept bitcoin payments again when more than 50% of its energy usage came from renewable sources.\nJuly 2021 Amazon posted a job advert for a \u201cdigital currency and blockchain product lead\u201d prompting speculation that it would soon accept bitcoin as payment.\nSept 2021 El Salvador become the first country to make bitcoin legal tender\nOther stories have been more mixed in terms of what they mean for cryptocurrencies.

{"text":"OSLO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Norway's $1.4 trillion wealth fund, the world's single largest stock market investor, is urging firms it invests in to engage with artificial intelligence as a way to drive profits, but to do so responsibly, top officials told Reuters.\n\nFund CEO Nicolai Tangen said it was crucial for all firms in its portfolio to engage with AI, as it is \"potentially a massive driver for productivity and efficiency\" that is becoming an everyday business tool like power, computers or the internet.\n\n\"We of course expect them to use AI for the best possible benefit of the business,\" Tangen said in an interview. \"AI is a huge opportunity for companies and for society, but we need to make sure that it is used in the right way.\"\n\nTangen said a company that would not engage with AI \"would disqualify themselves as being complete morons\".\n\nThe fund invests in 9,200 firms worldwide, for which it sets expectations on a range of issues, from children's rights to climate change.\n\nIts latest document, to be published Wednesday, is on consumers' interests, with a heavy focus on AI.\n\nWhen talking to firms about responsible AI, the fund will concentrate particularly on the healthcare, finance and large tech sectors, because their use of the technology will have an especially strong impact on consumers.\n\nCompanies must be able to explain why they are developing particular AI systems and how they have been designed, trained and tested, according to the document. There should also be effective human oversight and control.\n\n\nThat is so \"people (who) are affected by the outcomes can actually go back to the company and ask 'how does your algorithm work? Why did I not get the loan?'\", said Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief governance and compliance officer.\n\nAmong other expectations set in the document, the fund said companies must be proactive in their management of AI-related risks, and have systems in place if or when things go wrong.\n\nSpecial responsibility lies with the top tech companies that develop AI technology since they are driving the change, said the fund, a top ten investor in Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O).\n\n\"They have to take responsibility for their development and use of AI,\" said Smith Ihenacho, adding the fund had already discussed AI with the large U.S. tech companies in its portfolio.\n\n\"We have done it and we will continue to do it,\" she said.\n\nShe welcomed recent self-regulation moves by U.S. tech giants as \"a good start\", but noted that there were \"no proper regulations in place yet\" and that more was needed.\n\nIn July, U.S. AI companies made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to make the technology safer.\n\n\"That is where there is room for investors like us to come in and fill the gap,\" said Smith Ihenacho.\n\nTech is the largest sector in the fund's equity investments, representing 11.9% of the its total value at end-2022, its data showed.\n\nDialogue with companies and voting at annual general meetings is the focus of its environment, social and governance (ESG) approach, but the fund can, and does, divest from companies that do not comply with its requirements. Last year it divested from 74 firms on those grounds.","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride over the last few years. All cryptocurrency is volatile with a track record of \u201cboom and bust\u201c cycles that have left many wondering whether it\u2019s safe to invest. We explain reasons for bitcoin\u2019s latest price action, along with the 2022 crypto market crash.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, dropped below $16,000 in November 2022, a year after it reached a record high of $69,000.\n\nThings started looking up in 2023, with bitcoin\u2019s price climbing above $30,000 in April. However, a rout in August wiped nearly all the gains made in the months prior. At one point the asset\u2019s price briefly fell to as low as around $25,200, down from July\u2019s high of $31,814.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind bitcoin\u2019s recent price action, and what might the future hold for the market?\n\nIn this article we explain:\n\n\nWhat is happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nWhy is the price of bitcoin going down?\nWhy did bitcoin crash in 2022?\nWhy is bitcoin so volatile?\nWill bitcoin crash or go back up?\nWhat\u2019s happening to bitcoin\u2019s price?\nBitcoin is incredibly volatile. It is prone to rising and falling sharply on a daily basis.\n\nIn the second half of August, the price of bitcoin fell from over $30,000 to its current level of around $26,000. This marks a decrease of around 13%, which could prove catastrophic to those holding the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency to be experiencing a tumultuous period. Generally, bitcoin\u2019s price action reflects wider market trends, with alternative cryptocurrencies known as \u2018altcoins\u2019 having a tendency to suffer in tandem with it.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is currently trading at a price of around $1,640 a coin, 10% less than a week prior.\n\nWhy has the price of bitcoin gone down?\nIt\u2019s impossible to assign a single clear cause behind bitcoin\u2019s latest dip in price, but here are some possible reasons:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk\u2019s spacecraft manufacturing company, SpaceX, may have sold part or all of its bitcoin holdings\nAnalysts expect the American central bank to keep hiking interest rates. This will make borrowing more expensive and potentially hamper spending on cryptocurrency, with investors instead favouring safer, traditional savings routes\nEvergrande, a Chinese property development giant, has recently filed for bankruptcy. There are fears that due to the size of the firm, the collapse will send ripples through the Chinese economy and hamper confidence, lowering cryptocurrency investment\nWhile inflation has fallen in several developed countries, there are still fears that it could remain historically high for some time. This can have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending on cryptocurrency\nThe cryptocurrency market has begun to face regulation in several major countries including China and United States \u2013 and therefore a stricter framework of rules. This has seen cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bittrex forced to shut down.\nBut while regulation could harm cryptocurrency prices in the short term, stricter policing of the market may give consumers greater confidence over the long run, which could see the market stabilise\nIt\u2019s not just the cryptocurrency market suffering. Global stocks have gone into a downturn as result of:\n\nThe war in Ukraine\nInflationary fears\nHigher interest rates, which have made it more expensive for businesses to borrow money\nTurbulence in the stock market has spilled over into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIs a bitcoin crash coming, or will bitcoin go back up?\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to investing, especially with cryptocurrency. As quickly as bitcoin falls, it could just as rapidly climb again.\n\nThere are a number of concerns about cryptocurrencies that are dampening its prospects:\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges going bust\nCrackdowns and heightened regulation in countries like China, the United States and the United Kingdom\nCalls for greater regulation across the globe\nEnvironmental concerns\nSecurity issues and hacks\nThe price being based solely on speculation\nFurther regulation is seen as a threat to the decentralisation of crypto, which is having an impact on the prices of digital currencies.\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is taking steps to crack down on the cryptocurrency market. This includes forcing investors to wait 24 hours after depositing money into cryptocurrency exchanges before they can access it. Find out more about the FCA\u2019s crackdown on crypto.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s actions is indicative of a wider trend of governments across the world taking the risks of cryptocurrency more seriously. If further steps are taken by regulators, we could see a fall in investment as the potential for profit in the market declines.\n\nHowever, in the long run, heightened regulation may prove fruitful for the market. This is because consumers may grow more confident with a stronger framework of rules, and a fall in volatility within the crypto market may cause them to be less fearful of losing large amounts of money.\n\nWhat are the positives of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nBitcoin\u2019s fans point to other positive qualities:\n\nTransformative technology that could revolutionise industries\nSimpler and cheaper transactions by cutting out \u201cmiddle men\u201d such as banks\nEasier global trade because, with a non-fiat digital currency, there would be no concerns about exchange rates\nTransactions are more confidential\nIt is a  safe store of value because it can\u2019t be printed or seized\nBitcoin has been touted as an alternative to gold, meaning it could prove itself as a hedge against inflation\nGiven its volatile nature, it is possible that bitcoin will gather momentum again at some point in the future (perhaps weeks, months or even years down the line, or perhaps not at all).\n\nCryptocurrency proponents will point out that given bitcoin\u2019s previous meteoric rises, it cannot be ruled out that the same could happen again.\n\nBut no one has a crystal ball and the speculative nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to predict.\n\nFind out more about the tips (and mistakes to avoid) when investing with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat caused bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2022?\nIn March 2022, the price of one bitcoin was around $46,000. But the market turbulence that followed saw this drop by nearly two thirds.\n\nIn June 2022 bitcoin dropped below $20,000 for the first time since 2020. This was prompted by the decision of Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, to freeze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions.\n\nThe move fuelled a slump across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, the most significant blow for crypto in 2022 was triggered by the collapse of FTX in November. This was a major cryptocurrency exchange which handled around $1 billion transactions each day. Its collapse had a knock-on effect on other crypto exchanges. In November 2022, the price of bitcoin fell to around $16,000, a far cry from its peak of around $65,000 a year prior.\n\nChina\u2019s continued crackdown on crypto also played a role. Transacting with or trading major cryptocurrencies is illegal there, as is \u2018mining\u2019 bitcoin \u2013 the process via which bitcoin is obtained. Find out more about how cryptocurrency works.\n\nIn addition to this, 2022 saw sudden and severe sell-offs of major cryptocurrencies. This triggered panic and further sell-offs which has knocked consumer confidence.\n\nDespite 2022 being a torrid year for bitcoin, it has since recovered some of the ground it lost last year and is now worth around $26,000.\n\nWhat were the negative stories behind bitcoin\u2019s collapse?\nNegative stories\nA number of negative stories and threats of further regulation contributed to bitcoin\u2019s collapse in 2022.\n\nThese included:\n\nNovember 2022 cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bust\nJune 2022, Celsius Network, a major US cryptocurrency lending company, froze withdrawals and transfers, citing \u201cextreme\u201d conditions\nJune 2022, Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, paused bitcoin withdrawals, blaming a \u201cstuck transaction\u201d that was causing a backlog\nEarly 2022, reports that Russia might ban cryptocurrency operations. After the invasion of Ukraine, there were calls for crypto exchanges to ban Russian transactions.\nMay 2021, Tesla boss Elon Musk said that the electric car maker would no longer be accepting digital payments over environmental concerns\nJune 2021, banks and payment institutions in China were told to stop enabling crypto transactions, and the Chinese government banned the mining of the currencies. Then in September 2021, all crypto transactions were declared illegal\nJune 2021, then US president Donald Trump described bitcoin as a \u201cscam\u201d competing against the dollar to be \u201cthe currency of the world\u201d\nFBI agents have seized millions of dollars in bitcoin from criminals over the years.\nAugust 2021, UK regulator the FCA in effect blacklisted Binance. Big banks such as HSBC and Santander blocked customers from making payments to Binance.\nAugust 2021, the International Monetary Fund warned the widespread use of crypto would threaten \u201cmacroeconomic stability\u201d and could harm financial integrity.\nWhat were the positive stories behind crypto\u2019s rise in 2021?\nThere have also been more positive stories and these have given the bitcoin price some protection over the past couple of years, as well as propelling bitcoin to its peak of around $65,000 in November 2021:\n\nMarch 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first big US bank to offer wealthier clients access to bitcoin funds \u2013 albeit restricted to no more than 2.5% of an investor\u2019s total net worth.\nJune 2021, a month after sparking a crypto sell-off, Elon Musk said Tesla would probably accept bitcoin payments again when more than 50% of its energy usage came from renewable sources.\nJuly 2021 Amazon posted a job advert for a \u201cdigital currency and blockchain product lead\u201d prompting speculation that it would soon accept bitcoin as payment.\nSept 2021 El Salvador become the first country to make bitcoin legal tender\nOther stories have been more mixed in terms of what they mean for cryptocurrencies. Among them has been the US Federal Reserve considering whether to launch its own \u201ccentral bank digital currency\u201d (CBDC).\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order that aims to co-ordinate the US government\u2019s actions on the regulation of digital assets.\n\nWhile many crypto fans think regulation is a bad thing, some think this new executive order could help with the development of digital assets, such as the CBDC, to ensure the right consumer protections are in place.\n\nRead our article here if you are still wondering whether or not to invest in bitcoin.\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Most readers would already be aware that Siemens Healthineers' (ETR:SHL) stock increased significantly by 15% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Siemens Healthineers' ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Siemens Healthineers\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Siemens Healthineers is:\n\n11% = \u20ac2.0b \u00f7 \u20ac19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every \u20ac1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20ac0.11 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nSiemens Healthineers' Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\nAt first glance, Siemens Healthineers seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This probably goes some way in explaining Siemens Healthineers' moderate 9.1% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Siemens Healthineers' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 18% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.\n\npast-earnings-growth\npast-earnings-growth\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SHL worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether SHL is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Siemens Healthineers Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\nWhile Siemens Healthineers has a three-year median payout ratio of 53% (which means it retains 47% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.\n\nMoreover, Siemens Healthineers is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of four years of paying a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 45% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Siemens Healthineers' future ROE will rise to 14% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.\n\nSummary\nOn the whole, we do feel that Siemens Healthineers has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

{"text":"From worsening bird flu to shrinking beer sales and a gloomy outlook for grocery bills, here\u2019s a snapshot of key food stories from around the world:\n\nWith the earnings season underway, food-and-beverage company results are sending a rather negative signal for consumer costs. Agricultural commodity prices may be tumbling, but on-the-shelf prices will keep going up.\n\nUnilever, the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, will continue raising prices because it has only passed off three-quarters of its higher costs onto consumers, CEO Alan Jope said this week. While the company hinted the pain may ease this year, it may sell fewer of its products as shoppers balk at paying more. In the face of higher input costs, food giants like Unilever and Nestle are also narrowing their product ranges as they try to simplify operations to save money.\n\n\nInflation on raw materials such as oils, corn, wheat, rice and potatoes should persist, Kellogg said, adding that it sees European consumers facing more pressure than others. The company reported sales and profit that outpaced analyst estimates.\n\nMeat & Booze\n\nThe trouble on the sausage and steak counter continues. Tyson\u2019s profits are suffering as inflation-hit consumers buy less chicken, beef and pork. Chicken is doing better than other meats, though. Sharply falling prices are boosting poultry demand, sending Pilgrim\u2019s Pride shares on a surge this week.\n\nDemand for alcohol, often seen as a recession-proof product, isn\u2019t looking great, either. Danish brewer Carlsberg expects this year to be difficult as consumers retrench and drink less beer, while Australia\u2019s wineries expect inflation, higher costs and interest rates to weigh on sales and margins.\n\nStill, there are some signs that inflation-weary grocery shoppers are willing to absorb higher prices on beverages and snacks: PepsiCo\u2019s fourth-quarter profit beat expectations.\n\nMore Food for Thought\u2026\n\n...or rather drinks. Orange juice prices are at a record as Florida\u2019s citrus growers race to collect what\u2019s left from one of the worst crops.

{"text":"WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a challenge by President Joe Biden's administration to the legality of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, putting on hold a deal that would shield its wealthy Sackler family owners from lawsuits over their role in the country's opioid epidemic.\n\nThe justices paused bankruptcy proceedings concerning Purdue and its affiliates and said they would hold oral arguments in December in the administration's appeal of a lower court's ruling upholding the settlement. The Supreme Court's new term begins in October.\n\nPurdue's owners under the settlement would receive immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed by states, hospitals, people who had become addicted and others who have sued the Stamford, Connecticut-based company over its misleading marketing of the powerful pain medication OxyContin.\n\nIn a statement, Purdue said it was disappointed that the U.S. Trustee, the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog that filed the challenge at the Supreme Court, has been able to \"single-handedly delay billions of dollars in value that should be put to use for victim compensation, opioid crisis abatement for communities across the country and overdose rescue medicines.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the legality of our nearly universally supported plan of reorganization, and optimistic that the Supreme Court will agree,\" the company added.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nAt issue is whether U.S. bankruptcy law allows Purdue's restructuring to include legal protections for the members of the Sackler family, who have not filed for personal bankruptcy.\n\nPurdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 to address its debts, nearly all of which stemmed from thousands of lawsuits alleging that OxyContin helped kickstart an opioid epidemic that has caused more than 500,000 U.S. overdose deaths over two decades.\n\nPurdue estimates that its bankruptcy settlement, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in 2021, would provide $10 billion in value to its creditors, including state and local governments, individual victims of addiction, hospitals, and others who have sued the company.\n\nThe Biden administration and eight states challenged the settlement, but all of the states dropped their opposition after the Sacklers agreed to contribute more to the settlement fund.\n\nIn May, the 2nd Circuit upheld the settlement, concluding that federal bankruptcy law allows legal protections for non-bankrupt parties like the Sacklers in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit ruled that the legal claims against Purdue were inextricably linked to claims against its owners, and that allowing lawsuits to continue targeting the Sacklers would undermine Purdue's efforts to reach a bankruptcy settlement.\n\nMembers of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing but expressed regret that OxyContin \"unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.\" They said in May that the bankruptcy settlement would provide \"substantial resources for people and communities in need.\"\n\nIn a court filing, the administration told the Supreme Court that Purdue's settlement is an abuse of bankruptcy protections meant for debtors in \"financial distress,\" not people like the Sacklers. According to the administration, Sackler family members withdrew $11 billion from Purdue before agreeing to contribute $6 billion to its opioid settlement.\n\nMany other stakeholders have responded in opposition to the administration's request to halt the settlement.\n\nA group comprising more than 60,000 people who have filed personal injury claims stemming from their exposure to Purdue opioid products told the Supreme Court they support the settlement, including legal immunity for members of the Sackler family.\n\n\"Regardless of how one feels about the role of the Sackler family in the creation and escalation of the opioid crisis,\" the group told the justices, \"the fact remains that the billions of dollars in abatement and victim compensation funds hinge on confirmation and consummation of the existing plan.\"","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"This year, hotel sales experienced a steep decline statewide, according to Atlas Hospitality Group, which recently released its midyear 2023 California sales report. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a record number decline,\u201d said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, who\u2019s been tracking California hotel sales for more than 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of percentage drop.\u201d\n\nStatewide, sales decreased 53% during the first half of the year.\n\nReay said he sees numerous similarities between now and 2009. \n\nBut, what\u2019s even more interesting about this year\u2019s dramatic decline in sales is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily square with how hotels are doing, a marked contrast with 2009, when the U.S. was coming out of the Great Recession.\n\n\nMost hotels \u2013 specifically in Southern California \u2013 have recovered from all the residual impacts of Covid-19 in terms of an operational standpoint, with revenue and occupancy rates having generally returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cThe big cause of this decline is the rapid increase in interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cThe one word that would sum it up is \u2018disconnect.\u2019\u201d\n\nReay said the disconnect exists between the expectations of buyers and sellers \u2013 the prices that sellers are looking for are just not comparable with the cost buyers must pay for loans.\n\nThis has resulted in an uptick in the notice of default filings and foreclosures, as well as borrowers simply handing keys back to their lenders.\n\n\u201cI would call this an interest rate-driven downturn,\u201d Reay said, noting that despite numerous similarities to 2009, we are not in a recession now because the operational side of the hotel industry is performing relatively well. \n\nLos Angeles hotel sales\n\nIn Los Angeles County, only 17 hotels were sold in the first six months of the year compared to 36 in the same period last year. That\u2019s a decline of 53%, the same percentage drop as the state.\n\nLikewise, of those transactions, the number of rooms that sold last year was 2,894, as opposed to the 1,315 in the first six months of this year, a 55% decrease. Also, the median price per room declined by 13% this year.\n\nYet, last year the total sales price was $808,259,906, whereas this year the total sales price was $1,008,790,000, a 25% increase. \n\nIn addition, the average price per room this year is up 16% year over year, further illustrating the disconnect between the expectations of buyers and sellers. \n\nAnd beyond high interest rates, Measure ULA \u2013 the one-time real estate transfer tax unique to L.A. city properties valued at or above $5 million that went into effect on April 1 \u2013 has hit the L.A. hotel scene hard, with many owners delaying selling.\n\nIn the second quarter of last year, L.A. experienced 20 hotel sales priced above $5 million. In that same period this year, the only hotel sale the city of L.A. had above $5 million was the $760 million foreclosure sale of the Fairmont Century Plaza, a 394-room luxury hotel located in Century City, by the Reuben Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhat you have unique to Los Angeles is not only this huge decline in sales because of interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s compounded by the fact that you now have the mansion tax and owners are really holding off on selling.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reay, as long as interest rates remain at their current levels there will be more pressure on sellers and lenders to adjust their price expectations downward.

{"text":"\tIntel has taken an axe to its financial guidance for the first quarter of the year, as the collapse in PC sales and falling market share in its server chips division late last year proved even worse than Wall Street had been expecting.\n\nThe news sent its shares down more than 10 per cent at the start of trading on Friday.\n\nChief executive Pat Gelsinger blamed the latest step-down in Intel\u2019s financial prospects on \u201cpersistent macro headwinds\u201d and a much sharper chip inventory correction than it had been expecting. Intel did not issue financial guidance for the rest of the year but Gelsinger held out hope for a rebound in the second half of 2023 on an economic recovery in China and improving demand from large corporate and government customers.\n\nThe chipmaker said it expected revenue in the current quarter to fall to $10.5bn-$11.5bn, pointing to an accelerating decline in its business after a slump in the second half of 2022. At the midpoint, the company\u2019s revenue forecast was nearly $3bn below analysts\u2019 expectations and implied a 40 per cent tumble from a year before.\n\nThe sombre forecast came as Intel revealed that revenue had fallen 32 per cent in the final months of 2022 to $14bn, compared to expectations of $14.45bn. Adjusted earnings per share in the period were 10 cents, down from $1.15 a year before and below the 20 cents that Wall Street had forecast.\n\nThe latest figures also pointed to a sharper deterioration in Intel\u2019s finances, rekindling worries that it will be forced to slash its dividend payments. The company reported negative adjusted free cash flow for the year of $4.1bn. It had cut its forecast to a decline of $2-$4bn only three months before.\n\nDavid Zinsner, chief financial officer, said the cash flow had been affected by the delay of $3bn of subsidies that had been expected in 2022, and that Intel was \u201ccommitted to maintaining a competitive dividend\u201d.\n\nMost analysts had already cut their expectations for Intel in recent weeks, despite the positive reaction to the launch two weeks ago of a new generation of server chips designed to make up lost ground on arch-rival AMD.\n\nThough an important step in reducing the technology gap that had opened up between the two companies, most analysts predicted it would not be enough to win back market share, and that Intel\u2019s market position would continue to slip until it manages to catch up in advanced manufacturing with TSMC.\n\nIn the latest quarter, revenue from Intel\u2019s client computing group fell 36 per cent to $6.6bn, while sales in the data centre and AI division fell 33 per cent to $4.3bn.\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}

The hacker ordered a new cell phone after seizing control of his cellular network account, and then ported Stephen\u2019s private cell number to a SIM in the new device, according to a lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16.\n\nThis exploit is known as a SIM-swap attack, which the Federal Bureau of Investigations warned in 2022 were increasingly common and targeted at victims who were likely to own large amounts of cryptocurrency. The FBI estimates that $72 million was stolen in SIM-swap attacks last year, up from $68 million in 2021.\n\nStephens founded Blockchain Capital in 2013 with his brother Brad Stephens. The San Francisco-based fund has since gone on to back crypto startups like Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and NFT exchange Opensea. Blockchain Capital\u2019s Twitter account was hacked earlier this month to promote a crypto token, according to Cointelegraph.\n\nStephens\u2019 lawsuit claims that the hacker used his cell phone number to reset passwords, and pass two factor authentication tests, at several unnamed digital wallets and then \u201cbegan to systematically steal plaintiff's digital assets.\u201d\n\nA day before the hacker moved $6.3 million to their private crypto wallets, they wrote to Stephens to brag that they could \u201cremotely hack anyone\u2019s phone number in the mainland U.S.\u201d in a message sent from one of his own hacked accounts to his work email.\n\nThe hacker also tried to steal bitcoin and ethereum worth $14 million from a \u201ccustodial cold wallet\u201d owned by Stephens but were blocked by a Blockchain Capital employee who had been notified of the withdrawal. \u201cThis notification was the first time that Plaintiff learned that Plaintiff\u2019s [redacted] account was under attack,\u201d Stephens\u2019 attorney wrote in the lawsuit.\n\n\nStephens\u2019 cell phone network only confirmed on May 15, a day after the funds were stolen, that he had been the victim of a SIM-swap attack. Around half of the funds were moved to cryptocurrency tumbler exchanges that mix digital assets which can help anonymise transactions, and make tracing stolen bitcoin and other coins harder. Stephens did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSIM-swap attacks typically rely on hackers manipulating or \u201csocial engineering,\u201d tricking cell phone network customer service operators into revealing personal information about a victim.

{"text":"DETROIT -- The Detroit Auto Show is underway this week, against the backdrop of an historic strike effort from unionized auto workers.\n\nAlmost every year since 1907, Detroit has played host to a trade show that attracts executives, celebrities, politicians, journalists, and everyday enthusiasts from around the car world, all of whom descend on the city\u2019s Huntington Place convention center to check out the latest the automotive industry has to offer. At this year\u2019s show, Ford pulled the wraps off an updated F-150 pickup truck, and GMC showed off a new Acadia SUV.\n\nLast year, Ford\u2019s latest Mustang made its debut at the show, and President Biden was one of several high-profile attendees.\n\nPHOTO: The UAW Solidarity House is seen on Sept. 14, 2023, in Detroit.\nThe UAW Solidarity House is seen on Sept. 14, 2023, in Detroit.\nMichael Dobuski\/ABC News\nWhile other cities regularly host big auto shows, experts say Detroit has long been the most influential in the American car industry.\n\n\u201cIt was the biggest, it had the most people, it had just the most excitement,\u201d Jessica Caldwell, Director of Insights at Edmunds, says of past Detroit Auto Shows.\n\nAdvertisement\nBut this year, the event is confronting a UAW strike that has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry.\n\nFor the first time in its history, union auto workers are striking all \u201cBig Three\u201d American automakers simultaneously. The strike could see up to 146,000 unionized auto workers walk off the job at General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. And for a show that\u2019s estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the local economy, it comes at a critical moment.\n\nPHOTO: Ford unveils updated F-150 at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept.12, 2023 in Detroit.\nFord unveils updated F-150 at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept.12, 2023 in Detroit.\nMichael Dobuski\/ABC News\nCaldwell says the strike will likely have an impact on attendance at the 2023 Detroit Auto Show, especially considering the city\u2019s close ties to the auto industry.\n\n\u201cHere in Detroit, [most people] know the intricacies of the auto industry and realize what some of the issues are with these workers - perhaps even know someone in the auto industry themselves.\u201d\n\nUAW workers are striking for increased wages and the restoration of certain benefits. They argue their proposals are fair given the profits Big Three automakers have seen in recent years, and are proportional to the wage and benefit increases the executives at their respective companies have seen. The automakers have argued they need that money to aid the transition to electric vehicles, and to be competitive against carmakers that don't have unionized workforces.\n\n\n\u201cStrikes are generally not happy events and auto shows are happy events.\u201d says Caldwell, \u201cSo it is kind of a push-pull here.\u201d\n\nThe UAW strike isn\u2019t the only challenge the Detroit Auto Show is facing.\n\n\u201cThe Detroit Auto Show is still reeling and trying to recover from the pandemic,\u201d says Mike Martinez, a reporter with Automotive News.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic forced organizers to cancel the 2020 and 2021 iterations of the show, the event returned in 2022 with a new, smaller footprint that added outdoor activities. That shows failed to attract crowds seen at earlier Detroit Auto Shows. Thad Szott, the President of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, estimated that the 2022 show drew in between 300,000 and 500,000 attendees. That\u2019s a far cry from the nearly 775,000 people it attracted in 2019.\n\nRegardless, the updated format is in place again for 2023. Ford, this year, unveiled the latest F-150 outdoors at the nearby Hart Plaza. The event featured live music, food trucks, and a lineup of antique Ford pickup trucks.\n\nRecent Stories from ABC News\n\u201cIt's smaller scale than it used to be,\u201d says Martinez. \u201cSo it's still trying to gain some publicity and draw in attendees, draw in media.\u201d\n\nJessica Caldwell says the show\u2019s smaller stature was evident even during the media preview days, which made the event feel \u201calmost like a regional show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're really only seeing news from the Detroit automakers: from Ford, from General Motors, from Stellantis,\u201d says Caldwell.\n\n\u201cNormally you would see news from, you know, maybe a Honda or a Hyundai \u2026 we\u2019re not seeing that this year,\u201d says Caldwell.\n\nPHOTO: Jeff Gilbert, President of the North American Car Of The Year Awards, speaks at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept. 13, 2023, in Detroit.\nJeff Gilbert, President of the North American Car Of The Year Awards, speaks at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept. 13, 2023, in Detroit.\nMichael Dobuski\/ABC News\nIn addition to Ford\u2019s updated F-150 and GMC\u2019s new Acadia, Cadillac unveiled a facelifted CT5 sedan, and Jeep similarly refreshed its Gladiator pickup.

A lot of times over social media, so that has really changed things.\u201d\n\nFord, in 2020, unveiled the new Bronco online.

{"text":"Limited supplier finance reporting rules can mask trouble\nIndustry volume has increased to $2.2 trillion worldwide\nThe accounting scandal that led to a $4 billion hole in the balance sheet of major Brazilian retailer Americanas SA centers on a common funding tool with notoriously opaque reporting: supplier finance.\n\nAmericanas, which nosedived into bankruptcy protection last week, is an extreme example of how the arcane practice, also called supply-chain finance or reverse factoring, can take advantage of loose accounting rules to flatter a company\u2019s balance sheet. The process involves a bank or third party paying a buyer\u2019s suppliers at a discount earlier than they would be otherwise.\n\nAmericanas hasn\u2019t revealed much detail of how it used supplier financing to mask its indebtedness, and its financial statements offer few clues. The company did not return multiple requests for comment. But what\u2019s clear is that the practice played at least some part in masking more than 20 billion reais ($3.9 billion) of debt.\n\n\u201cWe see the nature of that supplier finance is more of bank debt nature,\u201d former Chief Executive Officer Sergio Rial told investors on Jan. 11. \u201cSo I have more debt than I had originally thought.\u201d\n\nRegulators, credit rating providers, and some investors have warned for years about the lack of accounting rules for these supplier-finance arrangements. Companies following US-based accounting rules must start disclosing this year that they use the financing.\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board, which sets the financial reporting guidelines used by Americanas, is mulling similar disclosures. The board met Wednesday to vote on when to make new disclosures mandatory, but put off the decision for another month.\n\n\u201cIf this is something that makes the headlines, I think we just are sending a very bad signal,\u201d IASB\u2019s Chair Andreas Barckow said of delaying the disclosures.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that supplier finance has played a role in major corporate financial collapses. Carillion Plc became one of the UK\u2019s largest corporate failures in 2018, with the defunct contractor using reverse factoring to label almost half a billion pounds of debt as \u201cother payables.\u201d Abengoa, a Spanish energy company, was brought close to insolvency in 2015, with supply-chain finance once again playing a large part.\n\nLack of Clarity\nIn a supplier finance transaction, banks provide what\u2019s essentially a short-term loan to help companies pay suppliers quickly. A company then pays the lender back later, sometimes 90 days or more. The retailer frees up cash by doing so.\n\nSuch arrangements between investment-grade companies and suppliers are considered low risk, but regulators and credit rating providers worry about companies on shaky footing using these tools to mask indebtedness \u2013 out of the sight of investors and analysts.\n\nEven as some have sounded warnings about a proliferation of supply-chain finance, the practice continues to grow. Issuance in 2022 hit $2.2 trillion worldwide, according to an estimate from BCR Publishing\u2019s World Supply Chain Finance Report published on Tuesday.\n\nSupplier financing itself isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, and suppliers sometimes prefer to get paid sooner even at a discount. The issue is a lack of clarity as to what companies actually have to disclose about their financing arrangements with suppliers, according to Peter Parry, who is on the policy team for the UK Shareholders Association.\n\n\u201cBecause companies are not obliged to disclose this, they\u2019re able to hide the fact that there is a major cash-flow problem,\u201d Parry said. \u201cIt\u2019s utterly opaque.\u201d\n\nSome Progress\nAccounting bodies have made some progress in attempting to improve transparency. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which don\u2019t govern Americanas\u2019s reporting published rules in September that come into effect this month forcing companies to disclose that they use supplier finance programs and how much is at stake.\n\nNew disclosure requirements would make it harder for blow ups like Americanas and others happen, but it could take years for changes to be made.\n\n\u201cDefinitely the new disclosures would solve that problem \u2014 there\u2019d be no chance of having supply chain financing and investors not knowing about it,\u201d said Steve Cooper, author of The Footnotes Analyst blog and a member of the IASB from 2007 to 2017. \u201cThis is exactly the type of situation here where the disclosures are important.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"When we think of tech in Indonesia, the first thing that usually comes to mind are homegrown unicorns like GoTo and Traveloka, big consumer-facing start-ups that are integral to the country\u2019s rapidly growing digital economy. And for a while, it seemed like this would become a new frontier of global competition, as companies like Uber tried to enter the market and waves of foreign investment underwrote explosive growth. But Uber pulled out, and investors have turned cautious on tech darlings like GoTo. Consumer-facing tech remains important to Indonesia\u2019s economic growth story, but it is not an area of high-stakes geopolitics.\n\nMastery of cutting-edge industrial technologies, on the other hand, still comes with significant geostrategic and economic advantages, and the acquisition and development of such technologies are both highly competitive and intensely political. In Indonesia, there are signs of sharpening geopolitical competition in technology-intensive sectors such as battery manufacturing, clean energy, and data centers.\n\nIndonesia is set to be a major player in the global clean energy transition, as it holds the world\u2019s largest supply of nickel ore, an important input in the manufacture of batteries. Batteries will be key in a low-carbon future, so Indonesia has leverage here. It has used a series of export bans on unrefined ore to force investment into higher value-added downstream activities like nickel smelting with an eye toward battery and eventually electric vehicle production.\n\nChinese companies like Tsingshan were some of the first to plow billions into the nickel-rich island of Sulawesi and have built large industrial parks there to process the ore domestically. Chinese battery makers like CATL followed by investing billions in domestic battery production facilities. Indonesian nickel has major strategic value to China, as it does to any country battling for supremacy in global electric vehicle and battery supply chains, and it shows.\n\nDIPLOMAT BRIEF\nWEEKLY NEWSLETTER\nGet briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nGET THE NEWSLETTER\nAlthough China may have had the first-mover advantage, a wave of foreign investment has followed as South Korean and Japanese auto and battery companies have rushed to catch up with their Chinese competitors by establishing or expanding industrial production in Indonesia. Ford even recently announced it would be part of a $4.5 billion nickel investment project (with a Chinese partner). There is a burgeoning techno-industrial ecosystem anchored by nickel mines and ending in the production of batteries and electric vehicles taking shape in Indonesia, and global powers are jockeying for position.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nGeopolitical competition coupled with Indonesia\u2019s bebas-aktif strategy with its \u201cmiddle way\u201d orientation benefits Indonesia\u2019s techno-industrial ambitions here more so than in consumer-facing tech, as global rivals race to secure access to scarce supplies of nickel. In the process, Indonesia stands to benefit from big FDI inflows and potentially the transfer and mastery of new skills and industrial technologies.\n\nWhile it appears that China gained a first-mover advantage in nickel, the United States has recently emerged as an important player in clean energy. At the G-20 last November, President Joko Widodo announced the Just Energy Transition Partnership, a $20 billion commitment from development banks, the U.S., Japan, and European allies to invest in clean energy. China was not part of this deal and has not been a major player in Indonesia\u2019s renewable energy sector. Given that Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s largest consumers and producers of fossil fuels like coal, and that electricity consumption in the country is expected to grow strongly in the coming decades, investing in renewable energy now has long-term strategic and economic implications.\n\nAnother area of the burgeoning competition is Indonesia\u2019s data infrastructure. China\u2019s Huawei dominates the supply of telecommunications equipment, but the field is more open for data centers and cloud computing. Next generation technologies like artificial intelligence need a lot of computing power and require big investments in back-end infrastructure, and Indonesia has been positioning itself as a regional hub for this physical hardware. Amazon already said it would invest $5 billion over 15 years in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, while Huawei pledged $300 million over five years. It is likely that competitive investment in this sector will intensify in coming years.\n\nThose who know Indonesia\u2019s economic history know that technology, economic development, and power are deeply intertwined. One reason the Dutch were able to exploit the land, labor, and resources of Indonesia during the colonial period was by monopolizing and restricting access to advanced technologies and know-how. In most cases, Indonesia still lacks the ability to indigenously push the boundaries of the technological frontier. It remains dependent on foreign partners for capital and technology-intensive development.\n\nNevertheless, there has been a push to capture more of the value added through advanced technology and keep it in Indonesia. This is enabled, in part, by the emergence of a multipolar world and increasing geopolitical competition. Great Power rivals like the U.S. and China looking to expand their spheres of influence must compete to secure market access, investment opportunities and strategic supply chains in countries like Indonesia. And the way to do that is to offer Indonesia the things it really wants like investment in technology-intensive sectors, and transfer of skills and advanced production capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell if or how this will translate into long-term mastery of advanced skills and technologies. And there may come a time when Indonesia and other middle powers in the region are forced to pick a side.

At the time, SOC urged shareholders to back the measure ahead of the company\u2019s annual meeting, saying, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s plans do not adequately address the company\u2019s civil rights impact because it largely overlooks concerns with franchisees, which make up 95% of its U.S. restaurants.\u201d\n\nThe audit aims to determine whether the company\u2019s policies have an adverse impact on McDonald\u2019s U.S. stakeholders, including franchisees, employees, suppliers and customers.\n\nWilmerHale will partner with Perception Strategies, a \u201cnationally recognized research and consulting group focused on issues of identity, dignity, and belonging, to enhance our understanding of the experience of Owner\/Operators across the country and to help the company continue to promote fairness and opportunity within our system,\u201d the memo said.\n\n\u201cAs part of this initiative, Perception Strategies will conduct a Climate and Belonging Assessment to gain deeper insights into the experiences of our U.S. Owner\/Operators,\u201d the memo continued.\n\nThe document added that the assessment would involve inviting randomly selected franchisees to participate in one-hour virtual focus groups about their experiences. The note also assured owners that neither McDonald\u2019s nor anyone employed by the company would participate in the groups or the selection process.\n\nThe memo said the process is voluntary and identities would not be shared with McDonald\u2019s, and another notice said the groups would have no more than 12 people. An owner told CNBC that some franchisees were expressing concern about the 12-person panels and potential retaliation by the company.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it has high corporate governance standards and a long history of being responsive to shareholders, and looks forward to reviewing the outcome of the WilmerHale audit. The process began last year following the 2022 shareholders\u2019 meeting and is now gathering feedback from a range of stakeholders.\n\nThe audit comes as McDonald\u2019s has made changes to its franchising structure and restaurant grading system in recent years. In December 2021, McDonald\u2019s pledged to recruit more franchisees from diverse backgrounds, committing $250 million over the next five years to help those candidates finance a restaurant.\n\nCurrent and former Black franchisees have sued the company, alleging racial discrimination. One of the suits was dismissed, while an action brought by former MLB player Herb Washington resulted in a $33.5 million settlement from McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe company also faces two separate lawsuits from media mogul Byron Allen, alleging discrimination in its advertising practices. McDonald\u2019s has fired back against Allen in recent weeks, filing a motion for sanctions against the media companies owned by Allen. It claimed one of his suits was \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cfilled with allegations that he knows are false.\u201d\n\nThe company has also committed to increase its advertising spending with Black-owned media from 2% to 5% of its ad expenses by 2024. In the filing responding to Allen, it said it was on track to meet those goals.\n\nOther major companies including Citi, Starbucks, Amazon and Airbnb have undertaken civil rights and racial equity audits in recent years, and last year Apple shareholders approved a proposal for a similar assessment.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"There are signs that the hot labor market is cooling \u2014 a bit. Job creation has been trending down, as have the wages posted by companies making new hires. \n\nBut it\u2019s still pretty hard for employers to find the job candidates they\u2019re looking for and pay them the going rate. National unemployment\u2019s at 3.5%, near a 50-year low. Plus, job openings still outnumber job seekers by about 1\u00bd to 1.\n\nAnother way to put this: Following all the labor disruptions early in the pandemic, we have faced stubborn labor shortages for years during the economic recovery. That\u2019s the case in multiple sectors, from the skilled trades to leisure and hospitality, from health care to high-tech. \n\nAdd demographic shifts, especially an aging workforce, and those labor shortages could be with us for a while. \n\nFrom his office on the outskirts of Chicago, Jim Piper looked down on the shop floor of his manufacturing company, Matot \u2014 where about 40 workers cut, bend and weld sheet metal to make dumbwaiters and lift systems for commercial and industrial clients.  \n\nSep 7, 2023\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to be as busy as we are, given the economic uncertainty that seems to permeate the news every evening,\u201d said Piper. \u201cWe have a strong backlog of dumbwaiter and material-lift work for new retail locations, restaurants, health care and manufacturing \u2014 many of the new semiconductor plants that are being built across the U.S.\u201d\n\nThat business is being juiced by the Joe Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act, he said. But finding new skilled workers is a problem he thinks about every day.\n\n\u201cThe crisis we could see coming\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably my No. 1 issue: the so-called silver tsunami,\u201d Piper said. \u201cWe have several employees on our shop floor that have been with us for over 40 years. Which is great \u2014 they\u2019re the backbone of our manufacturing facility \u2014 but we recognize that we\u2019re going to need to replace them soon.\u201d\n\nThe demographic shift Piper\u2019s preparing for in his business has been predicted for decades. \u201cThis was the crisis we could see coming,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a consulting firm focused on small- and medium-sized businesses. \u201cThe conditions that prevailed for almost our entire lives \u2014 excess supply of labor caused by the size of the baby boom \u2014 has now come to an end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe onset of the pandemic, with the acceleration of the retirement of the boomers,\u201d Brusuelas continued, \u201chas created a confluence of events where we have a labor shortage that\u2019s verging on a crisis, that\u2019s going to cause big changes in firms, with respect to wages and flexibility, and public policy.\u201d\n\nWorkers age 25 to 54 have largely returned to the workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that group\u2019s labor force participation rate, or LFPR, was 83.4% in July 2023, up slightly from 83% in February 2020. But participation among older workers, those 55 and up, remains 1.7 percentage points lower than it was before the pandemic (38.6% in July 2023, down from 40.3% in February 2020). The LFPR for those 65 and over has fallen 1.5 percentage points.  \n\nThe COVID retirement surge\n\u201cBecause of their increased vulnerability, we saw older workers during the pandemic leave the labor force,\u201d explained Sharon Block, executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School.\n\nBlock predicted more of the same could be in store. \u201cIf we see an upsurge in the pandemic or something unexpected with COVID, I think you would expect to see that dynamic of older workers leaving the workforce again accelerate.\u201d\n\nBrusuelas pointed out that some older workers who retired early in recent years might be prodded to un-retire and return to work \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 out of economic necessity, perhaps driven by continuing inflation, dwindling savings or other financial setbacks.\n\n\u201cWe know that two-thirds of the public doesn\u2019t have $400 for a financial emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, you\u2019re going to have an ebb and a flow of those 55 and older reentering the workforce. But there\u2019s not enough of them to make a difference.\u201d  \n\nThat\u2019s because as the years go by, the wave of retiring boomers will outnumber those who return to work by a bigger and bigger margin. \n\nA reframing of \u201clabor shortages\u201d\nThat surge in retirements means labor shortages are likely to persist, driving wages up in such industries as leisure and hospitality, health care, construction and manufacturing, said Teresa Carroll, CEO of California-based workforce management firm Magnit.\n\n\u201cIn the skilled trades, the shortage is very significant,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cNursing has gone through its increase in wages because of the post-pandemic, the aging of the population and the need for more health care workers.\u201d\n\nBut are these labor shortages new? And are they really labor shortages?\n\nAfter all, employers have been complaining about not being able to find qualified workers for decades, said Erica Groshen, who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics during the Barack Obama administration and is currently senior economics adviser at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n\n\u201cWith nurses, I don\u2019t know of a time in my professional life that there hasn\u2019t been a quote-unquote \u2018shortage of nurses,\u2019\u201d Groshen said.\n\nWhat some call an economywide labor shortage, Groshen argues, is more properly seen as a failure by employers to offer high enough pay to get workers off the sidelines.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

Going forward, we will need more specialists.   \n\nClaudia Marcusson, managing director, Zero Emissions Fund\n\nAccording to a survey by banking software company Mambu in 2021, demand for greener financial products is higher in Asia Pacific than the global average as consumers look for more responsible ways to invest their money.\n\nOf the respondents polled across Asia Pacific, 31 per cent indicated having knowingly banked with a sustainable finance institution or made use of a green banking product or service \u2013 higher than the global average of 29 per cent.\n\nSkills crunch\nClaudia Marcusson, managing partner at Zero Emissions Fund, a Singapore-based seed-stage sustainability venture fund, said that while sustainability departments in Asia are being \u201cparked\u201d in various corporate functions in response to regulatory or legal requirements, there is a need for more specialists with the requisite skills to drive sustainability progress in corporate Asia.\n\n\u201cPeople may have read articles about sustainability or read about Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, but they are not specialists. Going forward, we will need more specialists,\u201d she said.\n\nAs corporate sustainability evolves in Asia, ultimately every member of staff will have ESG-related key performance indicators (KPIs) to fulfil, she said, and the \u201csoft skills\u201d in sustainability roles are often missing. \n\nIn a recent interview with Eco-Business, Anita Neville, the chief sustainability and communications officer for palm oil company Golden Agri-Resources, pointed out that the art of persuasion is fundamental to her role in driving progress internally.\n\nA forgiving industry\nChidambaram pointed out that, until recently, sustainable finance has been a \u201cvery forgiving industry\u201d, with a dearth of standards that seriously police what is defined as a sustainable finance product or service.\n\n\u201cAnything could be deemed sustainable, anyone could give you an ESG rating, and anything could be marketed as sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost any sustainable financial product right now is unregulated.\u201d\n\nBut this is changing, as central banks in some jurisdictions, for instance in the European Union, start to crack down on financial institutions trying to exploit regulatory loopholes, Chidambaram said.\n\n\u201cThere will be consequences if you\u2019re not compliant, and sell yourself in that way,\u201d he said, pointing out that MAS is moving in the same direction. \n\nThis is where the talent gap comes into focus, he said.\n\n\u201cIf these markets start getting regulated, if you hire inexperienced people to take care of compliance, there will be a problem,\u201d Chidambaram said.\n\nThis, he said, is where the \u201crubber hits the road\u201d and presents the industry with a \u201cmoving challenge\u201d.\n\nSustainable finance professionals, Chidambaram said, need ESG domain knowledge, tech skills, and data science knowhow to address \u201chuge data gaps\u201d in a very young industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make investment decisions without data,\u201d he said.\n\nBalfour noted that one of the problems for sustainable finance professionals is that their skillsets do not intersect with the sustainability world.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of a playbook [for sustainable finance] because it\u2019s an emerging space,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, the sustainability skillset sits in a circle by itself.

The supply chain constraints, especially in motor components, are also expected to weigh on production in the current quarter.\n\nOn Monday, Lordstown posted sales of three vehicles and said it incurred $30 million in cost of sales. But, it did not provide a production or delivery forecast for the electric pickup truck during a conference call with analysts.\n\n\"We will continue to execute a capital constrained business plan,\" CFO Adam Kroll said, adding that Lordstown will need to raise \"significantly more\" capital to cover costs related to developing its new vehicle.\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $102.3 million, compared with $81.2 million a year earlier. The results included an impairment charge of $36.5 million that the firm said was driven mainly by a decrease in its stock price.\n\nThe company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $221.7 million and it expects to have between $150 million and $170 million in cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter.\n\nLordstown also reiterated doubt in its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe firm's revenue of $194,000, widely missed estimates of $1.29 million, while its adjusted loss was larger than expected.","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"As freight truck utilization continues to fall from pandemic-era capacity, more small carriers are giving up for-hire authority as equipment and other carrier costs remain higher at the start of 2023. This could be a slow, messy year for freight.\n\nThe trucking industry lost more carriers in December than any month since Hurricane Katrina disrupted much of the over-the-road freight industry, according to data fromFTR Transportation Intelligence. This followed months upon months of more new motor carriers trying to get in on the raging freight market.\n\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nMonthly net-change in U.S. for-hire carrier population, according to FMCSA data analyzed by FTR Transportation Intelligence.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking trucking, the thing that really pops out is what has happened with the carrier population base the last two and a half years,\u201d Avery Vise, FTR\u2019s VP of trucking, said during an FTR State of Freight webinar on Jan. 12.\n\n\nThe booming freight market born out of the pandemic that began nearly three years ago created a market for new for-hire carriers within a thriving spot market. During most of 2020 and 2021, hundreds to thousands of companies established for-hire authority each month. While there were fits and starts through much of 2022, Vise said the industry started losing \u201ca pretty substantial number\u201d of carriers in October.\n\n\u201cPreliminary data for December would indicate that we have lost more carriers in December than we lost in any month on record\u2014with the exception of December \u201905, which was in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and all the disruptions that led to,\u201d Vise said. \u201cThis is likely to continue for a period of time.\u201d\n\nSmaller carriers turn to driving jobs\nMost of these new and departing carriers are independent, one-truck operations, Vise noted. While smaller carriers are leaving the industry, for-hire payroll employment is leveling out its steady climb since it was knocked down by COVID-19 in March 2020.\n\n\u201cWe lost a lot of carriers in the springtime, but when you see the amount of growth we\u2019ve had in the second quarter in payroll employment, clearly what happened here is that a lot of those workers\u2014mostly drivers\u2014were absorbed into larger carriers,\u201d Vise explained. \u201cAnd we really just saw a shift of activity and capacity from the spot market into the contract market.\u201d\n\n\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nFor-hire trucking jobs, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data of trucking industry payrolls, is above pre-pandemic levels but appears to be peaking, according to FTR.\nFor-hire trucking jobs, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data of trucking industry payrolls, is above pre-pandemic levels but appears to be peaking, according to FTR.\nWhile remaining above pre-pandemic levels, Vise said new carrier numbers started to flatten when diesel prices surged and spot market rates fell in 2022. But if the current trendline continues, he expects the carrier population to return closer to early 2020 levels.\n\nDean Croke, DAT Freight & Analytics principal analyst, told FleetOwner last week that the spot and contract markets are both declining with the excess capacity in the market to start 2023.\n\n\u201cEven though demand is relatively flat, we\u2019ve got more trucks than loads, and that\u2019s why rates will continue to go down through the first quarter,\u201d Croke said. \u201cThis quiet season will be quieter than normal because of the economic conditions we are working with and mostly because there is an excess of capacity in the market against the backdrop of cooling demand. And that just puts more downward pressure on rates. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing spot rates continue to decline longer term.\u201d\n\nSee also: Spot market returning to \u2018seasonal\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 after 2021 surge, 2022 slump\n\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nSpot-rate data, as posted on Truckstop, since 2020.

The green line is the posted rate, the blue line is the rate excluding fuel surcharges.\nVise said that demand in the contracted freight sector has allowed the industry to absorb some of the lost smaller carriers as larger carriers have sought out drivers. But he expects demand to wither in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have, at this point, essentially flattened out our current forecast, which likely will be revised downward at the end of this month,\u201d Vise said of FTR prognostications. \u201cWe're essentially just running flat\u2014just a little bit above flat for this year in the total number of truck loadings. And we\u2019ll likely be looking at a small negative number when we update our information.\u201d\n\nVise predicted that as smaller carriers fail, there will be less capacity for those drivers to find work with larger carriers.\n\nFreight factors to watch in 2023\nVise said that FTR sees fuel prices and spot rates as two leading factors that could dictate the 2023 freight market.\n\nThe smaller carriers remaining in 2023 are still grappling with diesel prices, which nationally remain about 90 cents more per gallon than last year.\n\n\n\u201cDiesel prices are probably one of the two biggest issues that most of these carriers deal with,\u201d Vise noted. \u201cWe're talking primarily one- to two-truck operations that operate primarily the spot market and live on rates. Of course, that rate minus the cost of diesel\u2014as well as all their other operating costs, such as truck payments, maintenance, insurance, and so on\u2014are a key factor.\u201d\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nTruck loadings are flattening to start 2023, according FTR analysis, which forecasts much of the same this year.\nTruck loadings are flattening to start 2023, according FTR analysis, which forecasts much of the same this year.\n\nSee also: 'Recession' shouldn't be a scary word in 2023\n\nBased on the current crude oil prices, FTR analysis suggests that diesel prices are 40 to 50 cents higher \u201cthan we normally would see,\u201d Vise added. \u201cSo there is still some potential there, arguably, for diesel prices to come down further.\u201d\n\nSpot rates steadily declined in the first half of 2022 before somewhat leveling off in the fall. \u201cWe did have a big jump at the end of last year,\u201d Vise added. \u201cBut that is something we always see as we lose a lot of spot capacity during the holidays. So that big jump tends not to stay\u2014it certainly didn\u2019t last year. So in all likelihood, we will see a sort of flattening out here.\u201d\n\nAvailable truck utilization in 2023\nAvailable truck utilization stayed high through 2021 and into 2022 before sharp declines that put it below the 10-year average of 91% by year\u2019s end, according to FTR\u2019s Active Truck Utilization Index.\n\n\nThe index estimates how many trucks are needed to haul all the available freight and divides that by the number of active trucks available to move that freight. Vise called it a freight \u201ctightness barometer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks to ease continually for the next several months, likely bottoming out around the late third quarter this year,\u201d Vise said. \u201cThis is going to be interesting because if we do continue to see deterioration in freight, we very well could lose a lot more drivers. That would weaken the near-term utilization quite significantly. But the other side of that is that it would probably put us behind the curve as we come out with a recovery.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut if the economy is worse in 2023 than FTR anticipates, it would create a more significant upside for freight heading into 2024.\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Twitter Inc.\u2019s legal battles over its mass layoffs last fall continue to grow, with two more former workers filing class action complaints and approximately 2,000 ex-employees pursuing claims in individual arbitration.\n\nThe social media company owned and operated by Elon Musk\u2019s recently minted X Corp. faces challenges both in and out of court because many, but not all, of its former workers signed binding arbitration agreements. Twitter included the contracts in the packet of documents given to job applicants who were offered a position.\n\nThe outcomes of those legal fights will test the company\u2019s strategy for dealing with the fallout of its massive and sudden cuts to Twitter\u2019s workforce, particularly its handling of worker severance packages.\n\nMusk fired about half of Twitter\u2019s 7,500 workers in November, following his $44 billion purchase of the company. Layoffs continued into 2023, reportedly bringing the company\u2019s headcount under 2,000.\n\nThe layoffs and subsequent legal action are just part of the chaos that\u2019s engulfed Twitter since Musk took over in October. The company also has rolled back its expansive employee telework policy, called on workers to sign a pledge to remain at an \u201cextremely hardcore\u201d Twitter or quit, and eliminated the blue verification check marks from users\u2019 accounts unless they pay for them.\n\nProminent plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan of Lichten & Liss-Riordan PC was the first to strike at the Musk-owned Twitter, filing a lawsuit on the eve of the big November layoff alleging that the company failed to provide the legally required notices prior to mass termination.\n\nAlthough Twitter pushed that case out of court, Liss-Riordan has continued filing lawsuits. She added two more class action complaints this month, bringing her total of pending court cases against the company to eight.\n\nLiss-Riordan said her firm also represents about 1,700 ex-Twitter workers in a mass-arbitration campaign against the company.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot more work than traditional class actions,\u201d she said of the mass-arbitration approach.\n\nLiss-Riordan has 15 years of experience turning to large-scale arbitration efforts when her clients are locked out of court, staffing up and building expertise while mounting campaigns against trucking companies, gig economy firms, strip clubs, and other businesses, she said.\n\nAnd Liss-Riordan isn\u2019t alone in targeting Twitter with mass-arbitration filings.\n\nOutten & Golden LLP; Kamerman, Uncyk, Soniker & Klein PC; and the Bloom Firm PC each represent groups of about 100 former employees pursuing individual arbitrations against the company, according to attorneys at those firms.\n\nAn auto-response message from Twitter\u2019s press contact email sent a poop emoji when asked for comment on the allegations against the company.\n\nTailored Claims\nThe claims former Twitter workers brought in arbitration overlap with some of those in lawsuits.\n\nTwitter\u2019s alleged bait-and-switch on its severance package is a major focus of many arbitration cases, leading to claims of breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and unfair competition, according to lawyers representing the former Twitter workers.\n\n\nThe ex-employees allege Twitter broke its promise to provide severance packages at least as favorable as those given before Musk bought the firm. According to one lawsuit, Twitter pledged to pay a lump sum amount that would include at least two months\u2019 salary, a pro-rated bonus, cash value of equity that would have vested three months after the separation date, and money to continue health-care coverage.\n\nInstead, they say they were offered only one month\u2019s salary in exchange for a full release of any legal claims.\n\nUnlike class action complaints, which require allegations that are common to a class or subgroups of a class, claims in arbitration can be tailored to the individual plaintiff.\n\nDepending on the worker, current arbitration claims against Twitter include discrimination based on race, age, and other protected characteristics; retaliation for taking leave; failure to reimburse expenses and pay all wages on time; and violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires a certain amount of notice before a mass layoff, lawyers said.\n\nSettlement Leverage\nSome of the firms representing former Twitter staffers regularly collaborate with one another to help handle the massive amount of work triggered by mass-arbitration campaigns.\n\nAttorney Jahan Sagafi said his team at Outten & Golden has been working on Twitter arbitrations with attorneys at Kamerman Uncyk and Rudy Exelrod Zieff & Lowe LLP.\n\n\u201cA lot of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers value community and collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for the clients and the lawyers.\u201d\n\nAlthough mass arbitrations are more laborious than class actions, the cost to the companies\u2014which are generally required to foot the bill for arbitration\u2014gives plaintiffs some of the settlement leverage they could get from suing as a class. Each individual arbitration can run tens of thousands of dollars in fees.\n\nUber Technologies Inc., for example, paid at least $146 million in 2019 to resolve the bulk of the more than 60,000 arbitration claims related to drivers\u2019 alleged employment misclassification.\n\nMass arbitrations also may be more expensive to settle than class actions, said Amy Schmitz, a law professor at Ohio State University who\u2019s written extensively on arbitration.\n\nParticipating in an arbitration requires much more time and attention from a plaintiff than a class action, Schmitz said. That means plaintiffs who are willing to commit to an arbitration are often \u201csqueaky wheels\u201d who want to be involved and be heard, rather than just being in it for the money, she said.\n\n\u2018Dragging its Feet\u2019\nTwitter has responded thus far by slow walking the arbitration process, according to attorneys representing former company employees.\n\n\u201cWe are frustrated that Twitter has been dragging its feet every step of the way,\u201d said Lisa Bloom of the Bloom Firm. \u201cThey\u2019re just doing everything as slowly as possible. It\u2019s a common but frustrating tactic.\u201d\n\nThe company has delayed paying invoices and picking arbitrators, and has been asking its former workers to produce copies of their arbitration agreements, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said.\n\nAlthough defendants in arbitration have latitude to stretch out the proceedings, the Federal Arbitration Act provides a path back to court if the delay reaches a point when a defendant has effectively waived its right to arbitration.\n\nThe US Supreme Court made it easier to prove such a waiver with its 2022 decision in Morgan v. Sundance, which said a party doesn\u2019t have to show they suffered prejudice by their opponent\u2019s actions to move the dispute out of arbitration.\n\nLiss-Riordan said she\u2019s prepared to call Twitter on delays that cross a line, but the company\u2019s conduct so far is similar to other businesses facing mass arbitrations. The cases are in their early stages, with a lot more action to come, she said.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

The rivals had been reluctant to merge.\n\nA sign that the deal was driven by \u200b\u200bthe government was that the government officials took center stage in the press conference announcing the transaction. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehman were placed at the far end of the table.\n\n\u201cWith the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,\u201d the Swiss National Bank said in a statement.\n\n'Many Thousands'\nThe deal comes after three days of intense talks, which saw UBS and Credit Suisse very reluctant to tie the knot. The former felt that the bank was doing well and did not need to be saddled with a deal that could only bring problems. The latter felt that its turnaround plan would be enough to recover. But the Swiss authorities feared that the crisis of confidence suffered by Credit Suisse would intensify and, above all, that it would spread to other banks.\n\n\nKelleher said the plan by UBS includes a contraction of Credit Suisse\u2019s investment banking business. This strategy would help it mesh with the \"conservative risk culture\u201d of UBS, he said.\n\nHe said it was unknown at this point how many job cuts would be needed.\n\nThe acquisition \"supports financial stability in Switzerland and creates significant sustainable value for UBS shareholders,\u201d Kelleher said. \n\nSwiss officials worked on the deal to avoid a riskier outcome. \n\n\u201cThis is a commercial solution and not a bailout,\u201d said Karin Keller-Sutter, the Swiss finance minister. \u201cBankruptcy would have been the highest risk.\u201d\n\nSince both Credit Suisse and UBS have operations in the U.S., the Federal Reserve had worked with the Swiss National Bank, its counterpart, on the merger.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability. The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient,\u201d said a statement Sunday by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nKeller-Sutter said she had discussions with Yellen and U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. Keller-Sutter said \"many thousands\u201d of Credit Suisse employees will be impacted, pointing to future layoffs.\n\n\nCredit Suisse had already planned, last October, to lay off 9,000 people. The bank had 50,000 employees through the end of 2022, with 16,000 employees in Switzerland. Its balance sheet amounted to half a trillion dollars.\n\nThe investment banking units are located in London and Singapore. In the U.S., Credit Suisse's investment banking offices are located in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.\n\nCredit Suisse has an operations division near Raleigh, N.C., with thousands of employees who work in its technology division in Poland and India.\n\nThe headcount at UBS is much higher, with 74,000 employees globally. The balance sheet of UBS is $1.1 trillion in total assets.\n\nEmergency Backstop for UBS\nOnce the deal is completed, the size of UBS\u2019 balance sheet will be larger than its competitors Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe merger between UBS and Credit Suisse is also the first major global banking operation since the 2008 financial crisis that devastated the global economy and nearly brought down the financial system.\n\n\nIt comes after a crisis of confidence in banks, sparked by the sudden collapse of California-based Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, after interest rate bets went wrong. The crisis of confidence crossed the Atlantic and hit Credit Suisse, a bank weakened by scandals, trying to turn itself around since last October.\n\nThe Swiss authorities granted a loan of almost $54 billion to the bank on Mar. 15, but this was not enough to reassure the investors, who continued to sell off Credit Suisse shares to the point where the bank's market value fell to $7.3 billion on Mar. 17.\n\nThe transaction, which is an all-share deal, is valued at 3 billion Swiss francs, equivalent of $3.24 billion. Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to CHF 0.76\/share.\n\nThe Swiss government has also responded favorably to a request from UBS for a financial guarantee in the event that Credit Suisse's legal problems return in the form of fines or lawsuits.

These include various extramarital affairs that executives had with lower-ranking female employees and an incident in which a director propositioned a woman applying for a job.\n\nWhat's most striking from the Times story is not just the specific misdeeds. It is Google's apparent willingness to seemingly condone such actions, either by continuing to employ those found to have committed wrongdoing or by allowing them to quietly exit, sometimes with a large severance package.\n\nGoogle's response consisted largely of an email sent to its employees by CEO Sundar Pichai and HR exec Eileen Naughton. It steered clear of most of the charges in the Times piece, focusing on how the company is approaching things now.\n\n\"In recent years, we\u2019ve made a number of changes, including taking an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority: in the last two years, 48 people have been terminated for sexual harassment, including 13 who were senior managers and above. None of these individuals received an exit package.\"\n\u2014 Sundar Pichai and Eileen Naughton\nOur thought bubble: It is true that Pichai has a different reputation from his predecessors and has struck a different tone than other Google executives. It's also true that many of the founders and several other high-ranking executives responsible for setting the culture (and some employees accused of misconduct) remain at Google or parent company Alphabet.\n\nMeanwhile, Rubin posted a short, highly specific denial on Twitter late Thursday, rebutting certain allegations leveled in the Times' piece.\n\n\"The New York Times story contains numerous inaccuracies about my employment at Google and wild exaggerations about my compensation.

{"text":"The Covid-19 pandemic and recent Russia-Ukraine war disrupted global supply chains and led to significant delivery delays, input shortages, and stockout risks. Firms exposed to such risks have been forced to rethink their production and inventory management from just-in-time to just-in-case. Using quarterly Japanese firm-level data, this column shows that relative to firms that purchase inputs only domestically, importers significantly and persistently increased their inventories of intermediate inputs. This suggests the possibility of a shift from just-in-time to just-in-case production after the pandemic.\n\nHongyong Zhang\nSenior Fellow Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI)\n\n\nThi Thanh Ha Doan\nEconomist Economic Research Institute For Asean And East Asia (ERIA)\n\nInventory plays an important role in international trade. Because of delivery lags and lumpy trade, importers face severe inventory management problems. It is reported that importing firms have approximately twice the inventory of firms that purchase materials only domestically (e.g. Alessandria et al. 2010). Supply chain disruptions during the pandemic have garnered attention from researchers and policymakers regarding the role of inventory as a buffer against input shortages. The previous study shows that among French firms exposed to the Chinese lockdown, those holding more inventories ex-ante performed better in the aftermath of the shock (Lafrogne-Joussier et al. 2022). Furthermore, Alessandria et al. (2023) examine the aggregate effects of supply-chain disruptions in the post-pandemic period and show that firms optimally hold inventories that depend on the source of supply, whether domestic or imported. However, little is known about global sourcing and inventory adjustments to supply chain shocks at the firm level.\n\nFigure 1 shows the quarterly movements in Japan\u2019s manufacturing production and inventory ratio indices (seasonally adjusted) from Q1 2015 to Q2 2022. Manufacturing production was disrupted during Q1-Q2 2020 after the Japanese government took its first emergency measures in April-May in major economic regions. Meanwhile, inventories increased substantially, and their magnitudes were much larger than the decline in production. The inventory ratio declined quickly after Q2 2020 but it increased again after early 2021. It is worth noting that the inventory ratio remains persistently high even though production recovered by 2021. In early 2022, the inventory ratio further increased, probably because of the Shanghai lockdown and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nFigure 1 Production disruption and increasing inventories in manufacturing industries\n\nFigure 1 Production disruption and increasing inventories in manufacturing industries\nNotes: Inventory ratio is the producer\u2019s inventory ratio of finished goods (= inventory quantity \/ shipment quantity). The year 2015 was standardised at 100. The indices were seasonally adjusted.\nSource: Indices of Industrial Production (IIP), Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).\nMotivated by this, in a recent paper (Zhang and Doan 2023) we explore a large-scale quarterly government survey of Japanese manufacturing firms over the period Q1 2015\u2013Q2 2021 and examine firm-level inventory adjustments to supply chain shocks during the pandemic, focusing on firms that source inputs globally. Our data contain detailed quarterly information on each firm\u2019s inventory of materials and supplies, work-in-process products, and finished goods. Japanese firms are famous for their well-organised just-in-time production systems and international production networks. Thus, they provide an ideal setting for studying firm-level responses (i.e. inventory adjustments) to supply chain shocks.\n\nImporters increase inventories after the pandemic\nWe first show that before the pandemic, relative to firms that purchase inputs only domestically, importing firms tend to have higher inventory ratios (inventories over sales) and stocks in materials and supplies, work-in-process (intermediate goods), and finished goods, even controlling for firm size. While this relationship has been documented by Alessandria et al. (2010) for Chilean firms, we show that it is also present for Japanese manufacturing firms.\n\nAfter the pandemic, relative to non-importers, importers significantly and persistently increased their total inventories (Figure 2) and inventories in materials and supplies, work-in-process, and finished goods, respectively (Figure 3). Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are substantial heterogeneities across all three types of inventories within each industry. For example, in the automobile industry, with prevailing just-in-time production and inventory management, work-in-process inventories (intermediate goods) exhibited a sharp increase during the pandemic, suggesting the importance of parts and components in this industry. These results suggest the possibility of a shift from just-in-time to just-in-case production during the pandemic.\n\nFigure 2 Importers increase their inventories after the pandemic\n\nFigure 2 Importers increase their inventories after the pandemic\nNotes: This figure plots the estimates of the importer-time dummy variables for the period from Q1 2015 to Q2 2021, controlling for firm size, industry-time, and region-time fixed effects.

Dotted lines represent the 95% confidence intervals.\nImport reliance and supply chain disruptions\nWe show that importers significantly and persistently increased their inventories, especially for firms with ex-ante higher import share and (multinational) firms that experienced supply chain disruptions in China. Figure 4 shows the relationship between ex-ante import share (defined as the average share of imported inputs in total sourcing from 2015 to 2019) and inventory ratio for the pre-Covid and post-Covid samples. There is a strong positive correlation between ex-ante import share and inventory ratio in both pre-Covid and post-Covid periods. Firms tended to increase their inventory holdings after the pandemic, especially those that relied heavily on imported inputs.\n\nFigure 4 Inventories significantly increase with ex-ante imports after the pandemic\n\nFigure 4 Inventories significantly increase with ex-ante imports after the pandemic\nNotes: This figure plots the relationship between the ex-ante firm import share (imported inputs in total sourcing) and inventory ratio in the pre-COVID (Q1 2015 \u2013 Q4 2019) and post-COVID (Q1 2020 \u2013 Q2 2021) periods, controlling for industry-time and region-time fixed effects. Each dot indicates a bin of firm observations.\nFigure 5 shows the relationship between supply chain disruptions and ex-post inventory holdings. The horizontal axis represents the year-on-year changes in foreign affiliates\u2019 exports to Japan in Q1 2020, and the vertical axis represents parent firms\u2019 inventories after Q2 2020. The red triangles and fitted lines show that the lower the growth of exports to Japan by manufacturing affiliates in China in Q1 2020, the larger the inventories held by parent firms after Q2 2020. In other words, Japanese multinationals that experienced a sharp drop in sourcing inputs from China tended to increase their inventories after supply chain shocks. In contrast, the blue dots and fitted line show the opposite pattern: the higher the growth of exports to Japan by manufacturing affiliates in other countries in Q1 2020, the larger the inventories held by their parent firms after Q2 2020. These results suggest that supply chain disruptions during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic had a large and persistent effect on importer inventory management.\n\nFigure 5 Supply chain disruptions in China led to an increase in inventories after the shock\n\nFigure 5 Supply chain disruptions in China led to an increase in inventories after the shock\nNotes: This figure plots the relationship between the y-o-y changes in foreign affiliates\u2019 exports to Japan in Q1 2020 and parent firms\u2019 inventory ratios during Q2 2020 \u2013 Q2 2021, controlling for industry-time and region-time fixed effects. Each dot indicates a bin of parent firm observations.\nWe further consider the potential factors affecting inventories, including the industry upstreamness in the production network, the prefecture-level severity of the Covid-19 infections, industry-level input and output prices, firm-level financial constraints, and firm-level uncertainties over economic and business outlooks. Even controlling for these factors, results show that importers always tend to hold more inventories relative to importers after the pandemic.\n\nConcluding remarks\nOur study is expected to provide policy implications for the debate on the robustness and resilience of supply chains by providing evidence of firm-level adjustments to supply chain shocks and the relationship between global sourcing and inventory holdings. Relative to firms that exclusively purchase inputs domestically, importing firms tend to hold larger inventories, even when controlling for firm size. More importantly, after the pandemic, importers reacted to potential input shortages by increasing their inventories of materials and suppliers, intermediate inputs, and finished goods. This is more prominent for firms with higher ex-ante import share and multinational firms that experienced supply chain disruptions in China. These results suggest the possibility of a shift from just-in-time to just-in-case production after the pandemic. Note that due to data constraints, we cannot observe whether a firm adopts just-in-time or just-in-case inventory. However, firms that rely heavily on imported inputs, and firms that experience supply chain disruptions do increase their inventories of intermediate inputs after the pandemic despite large carrying costs.\n\nInventories can act as buffers against supply chain disruptions and input shortages during pandemics and other supply chain shocks. However, increasing inventory is accompanied by increasing costs, which are crucial for firms with financial constraints. Thus, policies that relax financial constraints are required, especially for firms relying on international supply chains and imported inputs. More importantly, policies in the post-pandemic era should support business efforts to build robust and resilient supply chains. It is also worth noting that because our sample period is until Q2 2021, it is premature to conclude that manufacturing firms have completely shifted from just-in-time to just-in-case production. It is necessary to monitor firm-level inventory adjustments and the macroeconomic inventory cycle.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}

He is the author of The Last New World: The Conquest of the Amazon Frontier.\n\nEven before Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva assumed office on Jan. 1, he was steeling himself for a national emergency. From cratered riverbanks and escalating violence to deadly pathogens on Indigenous lands, wildcat gold prospectors had left their devastating mark on the Amazon basin. Waved on by former President Jair Bolsonaro between 2019 and 2022, they helped nudge Brazil closer to the status of global pariah.\n\nLula wasted no time, immediately revoking two of his predecessor's executive orders that had sped up irregular gold mining. He went on to dispatch security forces to evict the miners from besieged Yanomami territory, sanctioned a provisional decree to crack down on the purchase of illegal gold, and set aside more than 2,300 square miles as protected Indigenous land. In early May, he sent three ministers to the region to assess the damage.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBrazil's latest rhetorical pivot from plunder to preservation drew accolades at home and abroad. At the COP27 climate conference last year, Lula declared Brazil was back as a climate champion and would not tolerate any illegal deforestation. Whether the world's largest tropical forest can survive Lula's broader ambitions \u2014 to remake his country into a regional power broker, bolster the clout of developing countries and help ring in a new multipolar world order \u2014 is another matter.\n\nA Brazilian road project cuts through the Amazon, paving the way to vast deforestation\nWORLD\nA Brazilian road project cuts through the Amazon, paving the way to vast deforestation\nLittle more than four months in office, Lula has crossed continents and oceans, calling on President Biden in Washington and Xi Jinping in Beijing. His hyperactive diplomacy is part of a wider Brazilian campaign to show that Latin America's largest country is beholden to neither the United States or China and will blaze its own nonaligned path. To press the point, Lula has sent emissaries to meet with Russia, dissed the faltering U.S. dollar, talked up doing business in China's yuan currency, and offered to set up a \"peace club\" to resolve the war in Ukraine.\n\nLula's boosters argue this is nothing more than diplomatic boilerplate for strengthening the hand of nations of the so-called Global South. But here's the paradox. Owing to geopolitical uncertainty, Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, a simmering U.S. and European banking crisis and wider global recession concerns, the dollar has tumbled on international markets. And as the greenback slides, gold \u2014 that age-old safe harbor of security and wealth in troubled times \u2014 has soared.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHaving risen nearly sixfold in the last 20 years, the troy ounce recently breached $2,000 and may reach $2,200 by year's end. Central banks are leading the scramble for gold; nine of the top 10 official buyers are in the developing world, including Brazil. Cue the acceleration of the 21st century Amazon gold rush, and with it, an even steeper challenge for Lula, whose global ambitions may well ride on the fate of the rainforest.\n\nWord travels fast in gold country. Every fluctuation in the price of the precious metal sends new waves of prospectors streaming to the hinterland, especially the states that make up the so-called Legal Amazon in Brazil. In recent years, tens of thousands of gold miners have diffused across the Brazilian Amazon (20,000 of them in Yanomami territory alone), many using mercury to extract the precious metal, spewing the toxic substance into rivers in the process. Artisanal gold mines (garimpos) expanded at three times the rate of industrial mines from 2010 to 2020, overtaking the land area for corporate prospecting in the Amazon.\n\nIn Roraima, a gold rush state in Brazil's far north, the number of gold brokers, smiths and jewelers has exploded in recent years. The frenzy is facilitated by the region's notoriously lax oversight, overstretched state institutions, local corruption and feeble command and control in mining regions. So even as authorities order episodic raids and inspections in the region, fortune hunters and their deep-pocketed sponsors decide the prize is worth the risk. Little wonder that clandestine airstrips and wildcat mining have multiplied in the nine states that make up Brazil's Amazon, with garimpos alone expanding 632% on vulnerable Indigenous lands from 2010 to 2021.\n\nIllegal mining may not be the biggest environmental threat to the Amazon basin. Clear-cutting the forest for cattle, bootleg timber operations and land-grabbing are by far the region's leading drivers of deforestation, which has spiked in recent years and now threatens to push the world's signature tropical forest beyond the ecological tipping point of regrowth and natural recovery.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYet the dirty secret of the Amazon is that predation isn't just an accumulation of transgressions but an ecosystem of criminality with interdependent accomplices who flourish in the shadows, studies by the Igarap\u00e9 Institute have shown. Beyond the prospector is an elaborate web of buyers, sellers, suppliers, financiers and middlemen, many who conspire to usurp the rule of law for private gain.\n\nAsk the Brazilian authorities who are struggling to crack down on illegal gold miners and their moneyed enablers. A recent writ before the Brazilian Supreme Court shows that, between 2021 and 2022, federal police launched 92 raids, which rendered 1,527 investigations into illegal gold prospecting and trade. Federal police found that roughly 30% of all the gold produced in Brazil is illegal, that production has spiked on nominally off-limits Indigenous land and conservation units, and that the whole enterprise is built on fraudulent financial certificates.\n\nOpinion: A violent tragedy foretold in the Amazon\nOPINION\nOpinion: A violent tragedy foretold in the Amazon\nMuch of the Amazon free-for-all is rightly attributed to Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who, during his 2019-2022 term, pandered to Amazon miners, timbermen and ranchers by easing environmental restrictions and scaling back inspections and policing. Yet the recent gold rush also owes to earlier measures to stimulate the Amazon economy by eliminating bureaucratic controls. Consider Law 12.844, a sprawling bill, signed in 2013 by then-President Dilma Rousseff, of Lula's Workers Party, which authorized the purchase, sale and transport of gold from artisanal mines, under the thinnest of pretenses. By signing an affidavit of good faith, miners, brokers and jewelers could bypass official oversight institutions to offer garimpo gold directly on the open market. At the end of April, the Brazilian court overturned that rule.\n\nOpinion: Brazil's President Is A Global Health Threat\nTHE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS\nOpinion: Bolsonaro is a global health threat\nSuch lenience, in the name of slashing red tape and job creation, created a regulatory fast lane for dirty gold by relaxing controls over buyers and sellers. In the process it weakened the \"traceability of gold production and commerce, increasing opportunities for illicit practices,\" the federal police's Amazon and environment division concluded last month.\n\nThe new Lula government did the right thing not just by clamping down on the legions of wildcat miners but also in targeting the shadowy network of buyers and sellers who work the institutional blind spots, co-opt local officials and game the porous legal code to trade in tainted gold. Recent investigations show that much of this gold finds its way to foreign buyers, including in the U.S. and the Arab Gulf states.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTaking back the Amazon from bad-faith dealers and resource pirates who profit by putting rainforest inhabitants in jeopardy is crucial to restore Brazil's tarnished sovereignty and rule of law. That Lula's wider geopolitical ambitions for Brazil in a de-dollarized, multipolar world order could also help usher in the next Amazon gold rush also shows just how complicated that mission will be.","labels":["geopolitical_issues","financial_distress"]}

For this breed of investor, a high potential for returns is non-negotiable. These investors usually demand reasonable business valuations. They require transparency and communication and are attracted by new markets and opportunities.\n\nAs U.S. citizens working in Colombia, we have since grown the Green Coffee Company into the largest producer of the country\u2019s national product\u2013coffee. To finance the business, we raised over $60 million from more than 450 individual accredited investors. This June, we raised an additional $25 million in Series-C funding\u2013a bright spot in LatAm funding according to Crunchbase.\n\nThere is an appetite for global alternative direct investments\nMany HNWIs are looking for alternative investments internationally, where they can invest directly in the companies of their choice. At the same time, these same investors often share with us their distrust of traditional private equity and venture capital firms that offer them a \u201cblind fund\u201d investment model.\n\nThe demand is there, without question, for business sponsors who can offer accredited investors the opportunity to make direct investments into businesses with high return potential in international markets. The millions in investment that we have brought to Colombia serve as evidence.\n\nInvestors want early-stage opportunities outside of tech\nWhen people hear about early-stage private company investing they think only of San Francisco and Silicon Valley. The reality is that even though they dominate the news, tech companies only make up a portion of private companies.\n\nFrom what we have seen with our investors, there is a very large pool of HNWIs who want to invest in private businesses outside of the sky-high valuations common to the tech world. Businesses with tangible assets and profits are back in style.\n\nThe sophistication of global high-net-worth investors\nWe\u2019ve seen a great amount of commentary recently arguing that investors should not need to see financial projections for early-stage companies before investing because they can never be accurate, essentially stating that financial modeling is dead.\n\n\nMuch of this mindset towards capital-raising comes from the tech sector where even the world\u2019s largest venture firms are guilty of under-diligencing companies due to their fear of missing out (or of leaving fees on the table). This is the opposite of how our investors tend to behave when deciding where to place their capital\u2013capital they often had to build a successful business themselves to obtain.\n\nHNWIs want to understand valuations and the expected financial performance of early-stage companies. Expect diligence, real diligence. Expect investors to hold company management to their forecasts post-investment, provide input, and share criticism. Investment capital must be earned.\n\nHigh returns are non-negotiable to attract capital to new jurisdictions\nTo stand out in a crowded investment landscape, businesses need to have the ability to provide superior returns. In alternative investments, total returns are by far the most important factor. Investors often penalize alternative investments due to their illiquidity as compared to publicly traded securities.\n\n\nIn the end, investors need to see a liquidity premium on their private market investments. To push outside their comfort zones and invest in individual portfolio companies at an early stage or in an emerging market, our clients want to understand how a business can reasonably achieve significant upside. In our experience, U.S. accredited investors will demand a reasonable path to 30-50% annualized returns.\n\nCapitalism has not changed as a result of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) push. Rather, our investors see ESG best practices as a means to an end. They understand a business has limited upside if ESG practices are not considered and implemented. However, presenting investments solely or predominantly on their ESG characteristics is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nCommunication is almost as important to investors as returns\nInvestors want more transparency and better communication than most traditional VC or private equity fund managers provide.\n\nQuarterly presentations to go over a plethora of portfolio companies with no depth provided (the status quo of current fund reporting) are no longer sufficient. Investors want to be able to ask investment managers questions and receive real-time answers. It sounds like an exaggeration, but we have found that there is no way to over-communicate.\n\nLeverage the opportunities that new markets present\nMany of our investors have never been presented with an investment opportunity from Latin America, a region that is oftentimes overlooked because of headlines about sky-high inflation in Argentina or the complete meltdown of Venezuela. However, these outliers are not representative of the region.\n\n\nDiscounting LATAM as uninvestable is a mistake\u2013and our investors have appreciated our contrarian approach. Investors are eager to hear new ideas from new geographies. We recommend that other founders leverage the opportunities that new markets present.\n\nMany U.S. accredited investors are ready, willing, and able to invest in new markets if the opportunity is unique and big enough to warrant their attention. There is currently a very competitive market for capital. Not all businesses will get funded, nor should they. Investors nowadays want to see real profits and reasonable valuations. We want to see more international businesses get funded. There are, however, some unbreakable rules to follow.\n\nCole Shephard is the founding partner of the alternative asset manager, Legacy Group, and the founder and a board member at the Green Coffee Company.

{"text":"STOCKHOLM, April 26 (Reuters) - Swedish defence equipment maker Saab's (SAABb.ST) Q1 results beat forecasts on Wednesday as countries continued to stock up on surveillance gear and weapons because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nOrder intake at the company that makes a range of military and civilian hardware doubled to 17.02 billion crowns ($1.66 billion) from 8.1 billion, while its order backlog increased to 132.66 billion crowns from 128 billion crowns.\n\nSaab, which competes with U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), France's Dassault and Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L), has seen strong demand for its products over the past year as the war raised geopolitical tensions, leading many nations to ramp up military spending.\n\nThe company's biggest customers include the Swedish government, as well as France, the United Kingdom and Germany. It also received orders from Lithuania and Finland in the first quarter.\n\nChief executive Micael Johansson said countries are increasing stocks to improve their own resilience, as well as to support Ukraine, which had translated into a strong order intake.\n\nThe first quarter was boosted by one order worth 8 billion crowns from the government of a Western country for a Carl-Gustaf multi-purpose shoulder launched weapon and an RBS 70 NG short-range air defence system.\n\nDemand has been particularly strong in the surveillance and dynamics businesses, which include sensors, deterrents, support weapons and missiles, he said.\n\n\"It's mainly Europe and the U.S. we see taking that responsibility,\" Johansson said, adding that European countries also have depleted stocks that need to be replenished.\n\n\"I think this will be quite long term because we are still in the beginning of this growth on creating a higher capability level, including Sweden...So we need to support that by increasing our capacities along with the market,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts at Citi said it was a strong start to the year for Saab, with sales, operating profit and orders beating consensus.\n\nShares in Saab were up around 4.5% as the market opened, but reversed course later and at 1027 were flat.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Johansson said Saab had secured a large volume of materials needed to make its products such as explosives, gunpowder, semiconductors, and raw materials for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe added, however, that as a result of the high demand the need to have a strong and more reliable supply chain had increased and further investment was needed to ensure security of supply.\n\nOperating profit for the maker of the Gripen fighter jet was 928 million Swedish crowns in the quarter, compared with 654 million crowns a year earlier.\n\nSaab maintained that it expected organic sales growth in 2023 to be around 15%, but that growth in the remaining quarters of the year was likely to slow from the strong first quarter.\n\n","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"Aside from the record death toll from the Ebola outbreak in Africa, businesses around the globe will be affected by the pandemic, with the mining, agricultural and energy sectors most at risk of having their businesses disrupted.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even companies that don\u2019t have operations in the affected areas might have suppliers there who have to shut down, making disruption of transportation and supply networks a potential problem for many other organizations.\n\nThe outbreak that began in Guinea and spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria had claimed more than 1,100 lives by the end of last week, prompting quarantines, flight cancellations and business disruptions.\n\n\u201cFrom a corporate risk management perspective, the issue is usually how to reduce illness and avoid business disruption,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, London-based head of population risk and data analytics research and development at Swiss Re Ltd.\n\nJohn Rose, Annapolis, Maryland-based chief operating officer of risk management information and consulting firm iJET International Inc., said travel and logistical networks are particularly sensitive to disruption by a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn area impacted by Ebola, you are seeing a serious reduction in air traffic,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cNo airline is going to fly a wide body jet to Africa if only nine passengers are aboard, so you have to have a plan B to move your assets around.\u201d\n\nQuarantines and border closings also affect employees and supply chains, said Kimberly Hale, a senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Chicago.\n\n\n\u201cCompanies need to keep in mind that if they are sending people to affected regions, borders can close at the drop of a hat,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nMining, agricultural and energy companies tend to have large operations in the African nations, so they now are bearing the brunt of the Ebola pandemic.\n\nFor example, Luxembourg-based steelmaker and mining firm ArcelorMittal S.A. last week said contractors working on expanding an iron ore mining site in Liberia had declared force majeure and were moving workers out of the country, shutting the project down.\n\nIn a statement, ArcelorMittal said it had taken steps to protect employees and operations, including providing thermoflash scanners to test employees and visitors for fevers at all its Liberia locations, personal protective equipment to hospitals and clinics, and training to health care workers and employees.\n\nJason Jarrett, Vancouver, British Columbia-based chief adviser for global business resilience, global security with Rio Tinto Group, said the London-based mining company, which has extensive operations in Guinea, put in place appropriate steps to minimize the risks when the Ebola outbreak was first detected in March.\n\nThe company enhanced medical support for its people, Mr. Jarrett said, noting that all Rio Tinto staff in Guinea receive regular briefings with the latest medical advice and those visiting are fully briefed on arrival. Rio Tinto is also providing sanitation supplies such as soap and chlorine to the communities in which its people live and work.\n\n\u201cTo support the work of the Government of Guinea and Doctors Without Borders in fighting the disease, we are distributing prevention kits, organizing public awareness campaigns and providing sanitation equipment such as shovels, rakes and refuse bins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also constructed some latrines in one of the main towns to help improve hygiene.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Jarrett said that while Rio Tinto has not stopped the movement of its people in, out or around Guinea, it is ensuring that travel is only for essential purposes.\n\nChris Baudouin, Chicago-based CEO of the Aon Global Client Network, said an aggressive employee safety approach is warranted.\n\n\u201cA lot of our clients are mining operations, which tend to have assets in remote areas and limited access to health care and transportation,\u201d Mr. Baudouin said. \u201cSo they tend to err on the side on caution, especially if airlines are shutting down flights.\u201d\n\nTo remain abreast of the situation, Susan Morton, senior consultant in the reputational risk and crisis management practice at Marsh Risk Consulting in Boston, said it\u2019s important for businesses to have pandemic, crisis response and business continuity plans in place, and closely follow guidance from organizations such as the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThere also are also dedicated, real-time third-party risk monitoring services available.\n\nMichael Kiewski, Chicago-based director of Aon\u2019s Crisis Operations Center, said his staff provides risk managers with real-time information from the company\u2019s crisis centers in Chicago and South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are taking open information from media and social media, analyzing it and sending it out to our risk manager clients,\u201d Mr. Kiewski said. \u201cWe are watching which airlines cancel flights and which countries are shutting down borders.\u201d\n\nCompanies with workers within the affected areas also face pressure from workers\u2019 families and adverse media attention that can tarnish their corporate reputation.\n\n\u201cStranding employees exposes you to lawsuits,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real risk.\u201d\n\nCompanies that do extract employees from affected areas of Africa still need to bear in mend Ebola\u2019s lengthy incubation period and plan accordingly. \u201cYou can leave Sierra Leone or Guinea and be perfectly fine and three weeks later come down with it,\u201d Ms. Hale said.\n\nIndeed, to reduce the risk of transmission, Mr. Jarrett said Rio Tinto has asked workers who have visited the highest-risk areas to stay at home up to 21 days before returning to work.\n\nGeoff Taylor, London-based executive director at Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. said the pandemic highlights the need for companies to focus on supply chain resiliency.\n\n\u201cYou might be able to withstand the loss of one factory, but what if you lose a key port or have an entire country subject quarantines or sanctions?\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have single-source suppliers or several concentrated in a certain region, it is good to contemplate what your options are.\u201d","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - First the good news.\n\nThe supply of minerals critical to the green energy transition could move close to levels needed to support climate pledges by 2030, according to the first annual review of the sector by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nInvestment in the critical minerals pipeline grew by 20% in 2021 and by 30% in 2022, led by lithium, copper and nickel.\n\nExploration spending was up by 20% last year with Canada and Australia both registering year-on-year growth of over 40%, notably in hard-rock lithium plays, according to the IEA.\n\n\nThe less good news is that the sector needs to do more if it is to match the level of demand required to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nMoreover, \"the adequacy of future supply is far from assured\", the IEA said.\n\nThe IEA highlighted potential problems with project delivery times, a continued lack of geographical diversification and \"mixed progress\" on improving sustainable and responsible practices in minerals and metals production.\n\nIEA clean energy equipment price index\nIEA clean energy equipment price index\nTIMING AND COST\nThe extended time-lag between a new mining or processing project being announced and delivered is a well-known issue in the metals sector.\n\nRisks of schedule delays and cost overruns have been \"prevalent in the past\" and \"cannot be ignored\" when projecting future supply, the IEA said.\n\nCopper mines are a good example, major new greenfield projects typically taking at least five years to enter production.\n\n\nThe problem is compounded in the case of lithium, a metal that is core to current battery technology, by the need to generate a high-purity product.\n\nThere is a significant step-up from producing technology-grade to achieving consistent battery-grade lithium. \"This means that even with an overall balance of supply and demand, the supply of battery-grade products may still be constrained,\" the IEA said.\n\nIn addition, new projects often come with higher costs, exerting upwards pressure on pricing.\n\nAlthough prices of some critical minerals such as copper have eased over the last year due to recession in the \"old economy\", prices for most critical minerals remain well above historical averages as supply struggles to catch up with demand.\n\nThe IEA's clean energy equipment index, tracking costs of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, fell consistently between 2014 and 2020 but has since broken that downtrend as raw material inputs push up overall manufacturing costs.\n\nProduction trends for nickel and cobalt\nProduction trends for nickel and cobalt\nLIMITED DIVERSIFICATION\nThere has been only limited success in diversifying the geographical sourcing of critical minerals in recent years, the IEA said.\n\nWhat progress has been made has come largely at the mining stage of the production chain.\n\nThe processing segment of the chain has actually become more concentrated as incumbent players consolidate their dominant position.\n\n\"Compared with the situation three years ago, the share of the top three producers in 2022 either remains unchanged or has increased further, especially for nickel and cobalt,\" the IEA noted.\n\nChina, which already dominates lithium processing, accounts for half of the world's planned new lithium chemical plants. Indonesia, which has emerged as the world's largest nickel producer over the last decade, will host nearly 90% of planned nickel refining projects.\n\n\"The world has not yet successfully connected the dots to build diversified midstream supply chains,\" the IEA said.\n\nMoreover, China's move to control exports of gallium and germanium underlines the concentration of supply in a host of smaller, esoteric metals that feed into the critical minerals landscape.\n\nOther minerals such as magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and silicon are all niche products but vulnerable to disruption due to a high reliance on a limited number of suppliers.\n\nDespite increasingly strenuous efforts by the United States and Europe to diversify supply chains, \"all countries rely on a functioning global market for critical materials and related technologies,\" according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n\n\"Each critical material has a unique geography of trade which, on an aggregate level, entangles countries in a broader web of interdependence,\" IRENA noted in a just-released report titled \"Geopolitics of the Energy Transition\" .\n\nESG CHALLENGE\nThe IEA's assessment of progress on environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures across 20 key companies shows headway being made on community investment, health and safety, and gender equality.\n\nHowever, \"environmental indicators are not improving at the same rate,\" it warned.\n\nThe sector's greenhouse gas emissions remain high while water withdrawals almost doubled from 2018 to 2021.\n\nESG issues have become a key determinant of new supply in the form of local push-back against both mining and processing projects.\n\nIRENA estimates that 54% of energy transition minerals are located on or near Indigenous peoples' land, the percentage rising to over 80% in the case of lithium projects.\n\nAround half of the world's copper and lithium production is concentrated in high water-stress areas, including the lithium triangle in South America, according to IRENA.\n\nPotential conflicts over both land and water rights feed back into the new supply equation in the form of delays at the permitting stage of any project.\n\nCOULD DO BETTER\nThis is the IEA's first major update on green transition metals and, like the IRENA report, it is an attempt to understand the three-way challenge of producing enough of them to meet carbon reduction targets, simultaneously diversifying supply and doing it all in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nThere's quite a lot of good news on the first part but considerably less on the second and the third, particularly when it comes to Western countries' ability to scale up their own supply chains in the face of environmental opposition.\n\nIndeed, the risk of minerals conflict appears to have moved up a notch after China flexed its critical metal muscles in the niche gallium and germanium markets.\n\nThere is potential for many more clashes in areas such as deep-sea and Arctic mining. Both are new frontiers for metals production but each is heavily disputed, both geopolitically and environmentally.\n\nIf it were a school report, the IEA's first annual assessment of the critical minerals sector would be headlined: \"Has made solid progress this year but still much room for improvement.\"\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"The pandemic shone a spotlight on the medical waste generated by stretched hospitals. The healthcare sector's decarbonisation efforts continue to be hampered by cost, habits and a lack of data.\nCovid-19 medical workers vaccine Philippines\n\nSept. 8, 2023\nThe world breathed a collective sigh of relief earlier this year, when Covid-19 was declassified as a global health emergency.\n\nHastily erected vaccination and test centres around the world were taken down after three years, as the last waves of winter infections tapered off. Heaps of medical waste \u2013 syringes, masks, scrubs \u2013 were incinerated and landfilled. More were dredged up in rivers and oceans.\nAs nations counted losses and devised plans to beef up health systems, many also pledged to redouble efforts to make the profession more sustainable.\n\nHealthcare\u2019s outsized impact on the environment was a known concern before the pandemic struck. A 2019 report found that the sector contributed to over 4 per cent of global emissions \u2013 more than other sectors like shipping (3 per cent), aviation (2 per cent) and hotels (1 per cent).\n\nIn rapidly developing but cash-strapped Southeast Asia, the struggle to strengthen while cleaning up healthcare could pitch different aspects of sustainable development \u2013 well-being and the environment \u2013 against each other.\n\nAs it stands, healthcare in Southeast Asia is not a big greenhouse gas contributor. The six largest markets, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, spewed 63 million tonnes of emissions in 2014, or 3 per cent of the industry globally. Indonesia has one of the lowest per-capita medical emissions in the world.\n\nBut healthcare emissions are known to grow with national wealth; Southeast Asia\u2019s economy has grown by 50 per cent in the nine years since. By comparison, healthcare already accounts for 8.5 per cent of emissions in the United States.\n\nExperts in the region say getting cost-conscious hospitals to move faster on sustainability remains challenging after the pandemic. While some have found good business cases in slashing waste and switching to clean electricity, scaling up these efforts requires a larger-scale overhaul of hospital operations, they say.\n\nAnd while certain aspects of healthcare \u2013 operating theatres, powerful scanners and such \u2013 are inherently power-hungry, habits and a lack of data could also be getting in the way of decarbonisation.\n\nBusiness case\n\u201cMost of Southeast Asia\u2019s public health systems don\u2019t have enough funding to continue operating at normal levels [post Covid-19]. Convincing them to do decarbonisation work with limited resources is a bit of a challenge,\u201d said Manjit Sohal, regional climate manager in the Asia branch of Health Care Without Harm.\n\nSo the global non-profit is helping hospitals find ways sustainability can also save money. In Southeast Asia, it advocates for measures such as switching to energy efficient lights and adopting solar energy, where upfront investments can be offset later with lower power bills.\n\n\u201cYou really have to give [hospitals] a good business case on why they should adopt [certain measures],\u201d Sohal said.\n\nCOVID-19 Frontline Health Workers Thailand\nHealthcare workers in medical garb at the Thailand Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute during the Covid-19 outbreak. Image: Flickr\/ UN Women Asia and the Pacific.\n\nFinding cost savings in sustainability is something Mary Johnston Hospital, a 120-bed facility in Manila city in the Philippines, has had some success with.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the hospital sanitised and reused medical protective gear up to three times before disposal, at a time when some equipment was so short in supply that they could only be found on the black market at triple the price.\n\nIn recent years, the thousand-odd solar panels on its rooftop have also been able to provide up to 35 per cent of the hospital\u2019s power needs. The institution has been diverting 5 to 10 per cent of the savings to funding treatment for HIV and tuberculosis patients.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to save the environment and save people at the same time,\u201d said Dr Glenn Paraso, the hospital\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe photovoltaic panels had cost about \u20b127 million (US$480,000), which the hospital amortised over five years, but cost savings would be made for 25 years, the lifespan of the panels, Paraso said. Some of the cells also came about via partnerships and donations from church networks the Methodist hospital is part of.\n\nOther sustainability attempts have been more difficult. Mary Johnston hospital had explored replacing plastic intravenous (IV) drip bags with reusable glass ones, but upfront costs would have doubled for the essential tool.\n\n\u201cWhat could I do? Can I pass [the cost] on to our patients?\u201d Paraso said.\n\nA switch to more sustainable hospital equipment could be significant \u2013 over 70 per cent of healthcare emissions globally come from \u201cScope 3\u201d, or indirect supply chain sources.\n\nBeyond IV bottles, reusable equipment \u2013 scalpels, syringes, tweezers \u2013 remains available in the region, experts tell Eco-Business, though they are quickly being replaced by disposable plastic equivalents, and one-time use kits, which are cheaper and more handy for doctors.\n\nBigger operational changes are needed too if more doctors switch back to reusables. While neighbourhood clinics can sanitise small tools in autoclaves \u2013 medical pressure pots for killing germs \u2013 larger, odd-sized and more sterile equipment, along with simply having more gear to clean, would require more centralised sterilisation centres to be set up, explained Dr Louis Tan, chief executive of StarMed Specialist Centre in Singapore.\n\nDisposable medical kit\nMedical equipment is increasingly sold as one-time use kits. Reusable options are still on the market today, but are more expensive and becoming less common. Image: Pxhere.\n\nData void\nNew medical trends have already started emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic, and one in particular \u2013 telemedicine \u2013 is said to reduce the environmental burden of healthcare.\n\nInitially offered to ease congestion in hospitals during the pandemic, patients have since caught on to video calling doctors for minor illnesses and simple consultations from home. Mobile healthcare application users doubled in Singapore from 2020 to 2022, consultancy Bain & Company reported. Emerging markets like Thailand and the Philippines showed greater jumps in application of over 11 and eight times, respectively.\n\nThe idea is that hospitals\u2019 Scope 3 emissions fall if they provide more telemedicine services, since fewer patients travel to doctors in person. But Tan has also seen a corresponding need for more transport services for medication delivery.\n\n\n\u201cDelivered medical items come in a lot of packaging, and the [trip down] to patients\u2019 homes could just be for a couple of tablets, or a bottle of cough syrup. I think this is starting to emerge as a potential problem,\u201d Tan said.\n\nThe bigger-picture problem, Tan explained, lies in figuring out if new sustainability measures really work for the environment and patient safety \u2013 including where reusable tools are adopted, or adopting different workflows.\n\nSuch information requires industry benchmarks and more granular research, something that healthcare institutions are not equipped for. At the same time, the medical industry operates on hard data and evidence, Tan said.\n\n\u201cIf you have the [safety and sustainability] information, no problem. But more often than not, things are evolving, and if you are at the forefront of that change, the data [isn\u2019t available]. That\u2019s why sometimes healthcare takes a longer time to adapt,\u201d he said.\n\nTo solve the accounting issue, Health Care Without Harm has developed an online calculator tailored for medical institutions, with guidance for hospitals to measure, for instance, patient commute, the use of anaesthetic vapours (some are powerful greenhouse gases), and pharmaceutical procurement.\n\nThe non-profit started training Southeast Asian medical professionals to use the calculator last year, and about 200 staff from 120 institutions have gone through the course.\n\n\u201cIn terms of who is actually reporting\u2026it is still a work in progress because getting greenhouse gas data takes a lot of time,\u201d Sohal said.\n\nBut she stresses a lack of data cannot be grounds for inaction.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at a hospital, immediately you can tell what can be improved. You don\u2019t need a set of numbers to tell you that. The numbers help you prioritise and maximise your efforts, but [the lack of which] shouldn\u2019t stop you from doing something,\u201d she said.\n\nTan agrees that there are obvious inefficiencies to fix in standard medical practice \u2013 such as prescribing patients more medication and refills than needed.\n\nFew partners\nMary Johnston Hospital\u2019s Paraso said having more hospitals on board for sustainability measures could help too \u2013 such as if collectives, with more buying power, bargain for lower prices on reusable medical tools from their suppliers.\n\nBut finding like-minded healthcare partners could prove challenging. While more hospitals are looking at using resources more efficiently, few are setting pledges and targets in stone.\n\nIn the United Nations\u2019 Race to Zero campaign, where businesses and local governors pledge action towards net-zero emissions by 2050, only 81 out of over 12,500 entities are in the healthcare sector. In contrast, there are 662 financial firms in the campaign, along with over 1,100 city governments.\n\nMary Johnston Hospital is one of the five hospitals in Southeast Asia in the Race to Zero initiative, along with Saint Paul\u2019s Hospital Iloilo (Philippines), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (Singapore), Sunway Medical Centre Velocity (Malaysia) and Syamsudin Hospital (Indonesia).\n\nThe low participation of hospitals could be partly attributed to the strict rules. The Race to Zero campaign wants members to have detailed action plans and report on progress annually \u2013 something Mary Johnston Hospital will have to start doing soon.\n\nThe campaign wants members to focus on halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050 \u2013 the best way to keep global warming under the 1.5\u00b0C safety threshold, according to scientists.\n\nParaso acknowledges such targets are, as it stands, unattainable \u2013 with at most a 10 per cent emissions cut by 2030 likely. But he says participating in the campaign is about being accountable and making measurable progress.\n\nThe health sector has a higher moral responsbility, because there is a Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. That should extend beyond the patients, to the environment that impacts patient health.\n\nManjit Sohal, regional climate manager, Health Care Without Harm Asia\n\nAt a national level, Laos, Timor Leste and Indonesia are among 66 countries that pledged to make their health systems more sustainable at the COP26 climate conference in 2021, held amid the pandemic. Laos said it would halve healthcare emissions by 2030.\n\nWhile disruptive, Covid-19 helped jolt policymakers into taking action on sustainability, Health Care Without Harm\u2019s Sohal said. Health ministries across Southeast Asia have a \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d, she said, though not all know their specific carbon footprint.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nFor now, many of the feasible sustainability actions centre around renewable energy, waste reduction and improving operational efficiency. Novel solutions, such as better hospital planning with artificial intelligence and medical gases with lower climate impacts are on the horizon.\n\nMore government support is needed to further scale up what hospitals can do, Paraso said. Solar panels probably need to get more efficient too, to further reduce the need for fossil-based power, he added.\n\nAnd because a key tenet of sustainability lies in the well-being of future generations, how much responsibility doctors assume for them \u2013 and not just present patients \u2013 could matter too.\n\nSome environmental advocacy groups in medical communities invoke in their campaigns the Hippocratic Oath, a professional pledge taken by doctors to uphold ethical standards and do no harm to patients.\n\nHealth Care Without Harm says the oath should extend to \u201cpeople and the environment in the long run\u201d. Sohal added that it means the health sector has a greater duty than other commercial sectors to decarbonise.\n\nIt is a message that may require greater amplification in Southeast Asia \u2013 the link between Hippocratic Oath and sustainability is not common talk in Tan\u2019s work circles, he says.\n\n\u201cI suppose at the working level, on the ground, it is not something that many of us are aware of,\u201d he added.\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"Somewhere in the South Atlantic ocean right now, a 34,000-ton, 870-ft. aircraft carrier is floating aimlessly on the waves. The vessel, caught in an international dispute over its toxic contents, is about to become one of the biggest pieces of trash in the ocean.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo, the only aircraft carrier in the Brazilian navy\u2019s fleet, has been stuck in limbo for five months. Brazil sold the 60-year-old vessel for scrap to a Turkish shipyard in 2021, and in August 2022, it set off for Turkey from a naval base in Rio de Janeiro. But while it was on the move, Turkey rescinded its permission to enter, saying Brazil hadn\u2019t been able to prove that the S\u00e3o Paulo was free of asbestos\u2014a toxic mineral used in the construction of many 20th century ships. So, the boat turned around.\n\nBrazil doesn\u2019t want it back, though. In September, a port on the coast of Pernambuco state blocked the ship from docking. The port argued there was too big a risk that the ship would be abandoned, leaving port authorities to pick up the tab for moving it and dealing with the asbestos. That left the S\u00e3o Paulo circling off the Brazilian coast, until Jan. 20, when Brazil\u2019s navy announced that it had pushed the ship out to international waters, where it remains. The navy says it had to do so because the aging ship, which incurred damage to its hull during its odyssey, could have run aground or sank on the Brazilian coast, threatening other boats and coastal wildlife.\n\nThe navy\u2019s solution is to abandon the S\u00e3o Paulo at sea. On Saturday, military sources told Brazil\u2019s Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper that the navy planned to use explosive to sink the vessel on Wednesday, seeing it as the only way to put an end to its controversial saga.\n\nBut on Tuesday night, responding to concerns from a federal environmental agency, Brazil\u2019s public prosecutor filed a civil case against the navy, asking a federal court to order an immediate halt to any plans to detonate the ship.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision will determine whether or not the S\u00e3o Paulo becomes an extreme case of vessel abandonment\u2014a problem that plagues marine conservationists and coastal communities around the world. Ocean watchdogs say sinking a boat as big and old as the S\u00e3o Paulo would be an environmental disaster; as well as the asbestos, the ship contains hundreds of metric tons of other toxic substances in its electrical wiring, paints, and fuel stores, according to the Basel Action Network (BAN), an NGO.\n\nAbandoning it at sea would constitute \u201cgross negligence\u201d and violate three separate international environmental conventions, says Jim Puckett, BAN\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a ship containing both hazardous materials and valuable materials\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be brought into the territory of Brazil and managed in an environmentally sound way,\u201d Puckett says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sink it.\u201d\n\nApproached for comment, the Brazilian navy directed TIME to its official announcements, which say only that the navy will not allow the S\u00e3o Paulo to return to Brazil.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for boats to be abandoned. Because they are expensive to maintain and to dispose of properly, tens of thousands of unwanted vessels\u2014normally much smaller than an aircraft carrier\u2014are left in harbors, on beaches, or at sea every year. In Nigeria, thousands of wrecked cargo ships and commercial fishing vessels litter the coast, destroying beach ecosystems and making waterways dangerous to pass for local communities. In Venice, around 2,000 abandoned small recreational boats are clogging up a local wetland. In the U.S., the Government Accountability Office estimates that from 2013 to 2016, there were 5,600 boats abandoned in U.S. waters\u2014likely a very lowball estimate, according to Nancy Wallace, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s marine debris program.\n\n\nThe problem is, what\u2019s left onboard those boats doesn\u2019t stay onboard. \u201cAnytime there\u2019s a vessel that\u2019s left at sea, the first thing to think about is toxic chemicals, which can be very impactful to wildlife,\u201d Wallace says. Abandoned boats of any size can cause oil spills and leach paint chemicals and microplastics into the water, while debris such as nets can come loose, trapping fish.\n\nOlder vessels can also contain so-called PCBs, a group of highly carcinogenic chemicals that were often used in electrical wiring before the 1970s and were globally banned under the 2001 Stockholm convention. When dumped in the ocean, scientists say PCBs work their way up the marine food chain, affecting everything from small crustaceans to orcas. BAN estimates that the S\u00e3o Paulo, which was built in France in the 1960s, contains around 300 metric tons of PCBs, based on analysis of its sister ship, the Clemencau. The NGO says leaving the vessel at sea would violate both the Stockholm convention and the 1996 London Protocol.\n\nIn Brazil, the face of the ship abandonment problem is Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro state, where some 200 vessels, including cargo ships and oil tankers, have been left to rot by owners caught up in financial or legal troubles. Local NGOs say the resulting oil and chemical pollution has dramatically reduced native mangrove, tortoise, and dolphin populations, and has hurt the livelihoods of local fishermen. The bay made national headlines in November, when a storm caused a 660-ft. cargo ship to come loose from its moorings and crash into the Rio-Niteroi\u2014Latin America\u2019s longest over-water bridge.\n\nRemains of abandoned ships are seen on the shores of the Guanabara Bay in Niteroi, Brazil, on Dec. 28, 2022. (Pilar Olivares\u2014Reuters)\n\nRemoving such vessels is a major headache for governments. Hauling them out can cost anywhere from $8,000 (the per-boat cost for 14 recreational boats recently lifted out of the water in South Carolina) to $1.8 million (the cost for removing an 83-ft. fishing boat in Saipan in 2021, which had been degrading a nearby coral reef in the Northern Mariana Islands for six years after a 2015 storm left it too damaged for its owners to repair.)\n\n\nBut, thankfully, it is highly unusual for a ship as large as the S\u00e3o Paulo to be deliberately abandoned. That\u2019s because large boats like cruise ships, container ships, and aircraft carriers contain vast amounts of high-quality valuable metals, especially steel, which can be salvaged and resold. (Recycling is also beneficial for the environment, since manufacturing new steel is extremely carbon-intensive.)\n\nPuckett, from BAN, says the idea of sinking the S\u00e3o Paulo doesn\u2019t make financial sense for Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s got millions of dollars worth of steel to be recycled, which far outweighs the cost of managing those hazardous materials,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a valuable ship being deliberately sunk.\u201d\n\nBAN is calling on Brazil\u2019s new leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to step in. To comply with international treaties, including the Basel Convention restricting the export of toxic waste, Puckett says the navy must tow the S\u00e3o Paulo into a naval base, repair the damage to the hull, and then offer the recycling contract to new shipyards in Europe, which can safely remove the asbestos before dismantling the ship.\n\nThe case brought by Brazil\u2019s public prosecutor\u2019s office opens a last minute door to that happening. It asks the court to compel the navy to carry out a technical assessment of all the options for disposing of the ship, and find a way of doing so \u201c\u201dwithout risk to the environment and public health.\u201d That might just save the S\u00e3o Paulo from a toxic watery grave.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"In the Asia-Pacific region, Sky One FZE is observing significant trends that can impact cargo volume growth.\nIndia Business\n\n| Written By\n\nBulbul Dhawan\n\nAir cargo movement: India is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the movement of air cargo, said Jaideep Mirchandani, Chairman of global aviation conglomerate Sky One FZE in an interview with Republic. Asserting that India's air freight market is estimated to stand at $13.08 billion (Rs 1.09 lakh crore) in 2023, he said that by 2028, it is expected to reach $17.22 billion (Rs 1.43 lakh crore) at a CAGR of 5.65 per cent.\n\n\u201cWith the country's rapidly growing economy and increasing trade activities, India is poised to become a crucial player in the global logistics landscape. Key regions that are expected to drive this growth include major industrial hubs such as Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, and Bengaluru, as well as emerging logistics centers in Gujarat and Hyderabad,\u201d he said.\n\nMirchandani also stated that in the Asia-Pacific region, Sky One FZE is observing significant trends that can impact cargo volume growth. \u201cThe rise of e-commerce, especially in countries like India and China, is driving a notable surge in demand for air cargo transportation. According to IATA, global e-commerce is predicted to exceed $7.4 trillion by 2025, indicating the immense potential for cargo movement in the region. Additionally, the development of multimodal logistics hubs and advancements in technology are improving supply chain efficiency and promoting seamless cargo movement in the region,\u201d he said.\n\nGlobal trade dynamics and air cargo movement in India\n\nAccording to Mirchandani, India's air cargo movement is greatly influenced by global trade dynamics, rapid technological advancements, and evolving consumer behaviors. As international trade patterns evolve, India's strategic geographical location places it in a prime position to serve as a transit point for goods moving between Asia, Europe, and Africa, he asserted. \u201cAccording to reports, India substituted China as the emerging market with maximum potential to grow and increase revenue, which reflects the country's strong growth in the economy which will drive demand and consequently air cargo movement. Technological advancements are driving efficiency gains in cargo handling, tracking, and documentation, while changing consumer behaviors are shaping the demand for specialised and express cargo services,\u201d he said.\n\nNational Logistics Policy\n\nThe focus on improving airport facilities and connectivity will enhance India's capacity to handle export and import cargo, making it more competitive in the global trade landscape, he opined. \u201cThe National Logistics Policy emphasises the development of multimodal logistics hubs enabling smoother cargo movement across different regions. This integrated approach will enhance connectivity, reduce transit times, and improve overall logistics efficiency,\u201d he said, adding that the policy's focus on infrastructure development, including dedicated freight corridors and Multimodal Logistic Parks (MMLPs), will enhance the transportation network and facilitate seamless cargo operations. \u201cForty air cargo terminals have been constructed and 30 airports have been provided cold-storage facilities across India for promoting export. This is surely going to boost the demand and efficiency of air cargo in the region,\u201d he explained.\n\nFirst Published:\n\nCOMMENT\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO US\n\nWATCH US LIVE\n\nFOLLOW US\n\n4 weeks ago\n\nHow Indigo tweaked operations to deliver consistently for 17 years and remain profitable\n\nid:4394_12001185\n\nesg\n09:06 | \n\nCountry\nIndia\nWords\n239\nMotoGP: First batch of bikes, equipment cargo shipment lands in India\nThe race is scheduled to be held at the Buddh International Circuit between September 22-24.\nThe first batch of MotoGP equipments have touched down at Delhi airport. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement\n\nWith just a week left for the race, the first batch of equipments for MotoGP Bharat arrived at the Buddh International Circuit on Thursday.

Widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches may fall there and in southern Nevada from Saturday through Monday. The heaviest rainfall is expected mainly Sunday and Monday. Locally higher amounts up to 6 inches are possible in areas impacted by the heaviest deluges.\n\nRainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible for parts of Arizona, Central California and northern Nevada.\n\nMultiple days of heavy rainfall will give the ground little opportunity to absorb moisture and can progressively worsen the flood threat.\n\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Wednesday that \u201cmultiple years\u2019 worth of precipitation\u201d could potentially fall in some of California\u2019s driest areas.\n\nOne of those places is Death Valley, California, the hottest place on Earth. Death Valley typically receives about 2 inches of rain across an entire year, according to NWS data. Moisture from Hilary could unleash enough rain to give Death Valley at least a year\u2019s worth of rainfall in a single day.\n\nRainfall this exceptional proved destructive in Death Valley last year. Around 1,000 people became stranded in Death Valley National Park last August when 1.46 inches of rain fell in 24 hours and unleashed flash flooding that washed away roads and entombed cars in floodwater-swept debris.\n\nDramatic weather changes for suffering Southwest\nDespite the flooding danger, the rainfall would help combat drought and recharge groundwater across parched portions of the Southwest. Drought conditions expanded in New Mexico and remained steady in California and Arizona this week, the US Drought Monitor reported Thursday.\n\nThe seasonal monsoon that supplies the region with a large percentage of its yearly rainfall has been missing for much of the summer, and cities like Phoenix are still waiting for measurable rainfall.\n\nThe combination of rainfall and increased cloud cover across the Southwest is expected to bring a significant cooldown over the weekend.

{"text":"Across Egypt, people have been left frustrated and struggling to complete daily tasks in the heat because of constant power cuts.\n\nThe power cuts, which are primarily affecting villages in Upper Egypt, as well as the Delta region and Cairo, come amidst soaring temperatures. \n\nTemperatures recorded in Egypt this year have ranged between 40C to 50C.\n\nWith power cuts lasting around six hours in some areas, many are finding it difficult to stay cool and go to work, with concerns also being raised about the wider impact this could have on the country's economy if the situation continues.\n\nThe severe power outages started last month, with the government cutting electricity from street lamps as well as other services.\n\nMohammed Younis, an Egyptian-based energy researcher, said that the power cuts have affected people from all walks of life, especially as people and the infrastructure are not equipped to deal with such high temperatures without air conditioning. \n\n\u201cThere have been many complaints about the power cuts in homes in Egypt, with remote areas being badly affected and they don\u2019t receive a lot of coverage in the media,\u201d he told Middle East Eye. \n\nRising discontent \nAccording to officials in the country, the power cuts are a result of the country\u2019s energy grid being put under pressure because the heatwave has created a high demand for electricity to power fans and air conditioning.\n\nThe constant power cuts are a source of frustration in Egypt.\n\n\u201cPeople are angry, even public figures who were neutral about the government have started to criticise the power cuts,\u201d Younis said.  \n\nLast week, the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) issued a statement calling on people to avoid using elevators, in order to avoid being trapped in them due to power cuts. \n\nAccording to Younis, Egypt\u2019s elderly have been some of the worst affected by this.\n\n\u201cMany people get trapped in the elevators and they can\u2019t go up six or ten floors every day, multiple times,\u201d he said. \n\nThe EEHC reiterated that the country is experiencing record levels of national electricity consumption.\n\nDespite frustrations being vented about the crisis, it is unclear whether the government is implementing any plans to tackle the power outages. \n\nIncreased frustration \nThe anger has also spilled out online, with dozens of people expressing their anger over the electricity shortages and voicing the different ways their daily life has been affected. \n\nMany have been using a number of different hashtags to speak about the topic, and have also called on Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, to intervene and find a solution for the long power outages. \n\nSome have even shared videos of their streets at night completely blacked out, with citizens using flashlights to navigate. \n\n\u201cThis is the fourth time the light has been cut out, going on for five hours. Where is the statement that is supposed to come out?\u201d one frustrated social media user wrote in a tweet.\n\nEgypt\u2019s prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, issued a statement claiming that the recent power outages were a result of increased consumption and pressure in the country as temperatures have continued to rise.\n\n\u201cWe are currently in a period of temporary load easing until the networks return to normal pressures,\u201c he said in a cabinet meeting last week, mentioning that it has also had an impact on the country\u2019s gas.\n\nMadbouly also stated that various measures would come into place to ration the consumption of electricity. \n\nThe statement was met with dissatisfaction from people online, who continued to criticise the government\u2019s response to the ongoing crisis. \n\n\u201cThe government is supposed to issue a respectable statement, enough placing the blame on people, people are about to explode. The electricity cutting out along with terrible weather and increased prices of goods\u2026 all of this and he comes out with a statement like this?

The hacker included a sample of 750,000 records, some of which appear to be authentic.\n\nThe database, which spans 1995 to 2019, would be sold for 10 bitcoin, or about $200,000, according to a post in a hackers forum.\n\nThe post was deleted one week later. The hackers website published a statement in Chinese.\n\n\"Hello, dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted,\" the statement read.\n\nThe New York Times, citing cybersecurity consultancy Security Discovery, said the Shanghai police data had been stored on a secure, closed network until a gateway was created, essentially punching a hole in the firewall. Such gateways are a common practice for developers to easily access the database. But such gateways should be protected by passwords, which were lacking in the case of the Shanghai database.\n\nAn industry expert told Nikkei that multiple types of contracted companies were involved in managing the Shanghai police database, so it is unclear whether Alibaba, agency authorities or other contracted companies should be held accountable for the leak.\n\nAlibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chinese authorities have said nothing about the leak. Search results for terms such as \"Shanghai police database,\" \"Shanghai 1 billion\" or \"1 billion data leak\" were blocked in Weibo, China's heavily censored equivalent of Twitter.\n\nChina has enacted laws to protect data and personal information, but these mainly target the country's big internet and tech companies. The country's largest ride-hailing app, Didi Global, delisted from the New York Stock Exchange last month after Chinese authorities raised concerns about data leaks.\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Top executives at Discover Financial Services are vowing to bolster its regulatory compliance framework, saying Thursday that the consumer lender \u2014 which is on the cusp of federal penalties \u2014 is suffering the consequences of years of underinvestment in risk management and compliance.\n\nThe firm's update to investors was highly anticipated after the surprise announcement Monday that CEO Roger Hochschild was resigning. \n\nInvestors appeared to give interim CEO John Owen a small vote of confidence, boosting Discover's stock price some 2.3% on Thursday amid hopes that the credit card company can avoid a worst-case regulatory scenario.\n\nBut analysts are still warning it may take quite a while for the Illinois-based company to remedy its growing headaches.\n\nDiscover has yet to hire a permanent replacement for Hochschild, a 25-year company veteran who had been CEO since 2018. A consent order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over consumer compliance issues is still pending, and executives who spoke on a call with analysts Thursday didn't rule out further regulatory actions.\n\nPlus, overhauling a company's compliance framework is never quick \u2014 or cheap.\n\n\"Obviously, the board did not have confidence in the CEO,\" said Kevin Barker, an analyst at Piper Sandler. \"So it's hard for shareholders and investors to get confidence in what is happening right now.\"\n\n\nThe $138 billion-asset company is about to undergo a \"reinvestment cycle,\" Barker said, potentially leading to permanent structural expenses that will weigh on its profitability going forward.\n\nOwen, a board member who stepped in as Discover's interim head, said the company has made significant progress over the last 18 months but has a \"fair amount of work to do.\"\n\nDiscover is focused on \"driving accountability and ensuring that we don't put profits before compliance excellence,\" said John Greene, the company's chief financial officer.\n\n\"I'm not saying that that was an overt choice that the company made historically,\" Greene said. \"But we do need to make sure that we invest enough to achieve compliance and risk management excellence.\"\n\nThe company \"historically underinvested\" in those areas, he said.\n\n\"And we're paying the price right now,\" Greene added. \"So we're going to make sure we don't underinvest going forward.\"\n\nThose investments won't come cheap. Greene said risk and compliance costs have risen by more than $300 million between 2019 and this year. Discover is eyeing spending of about $460 million on those issues in 2023. And while the company hasn't finalized its budget for 2024, Greene said that he \"wouldn't expect\" its risk and compliance costs to decrease.\n\nThe big concern among investors is that Discover will be stuck in a \"prolonged compliance quagmire,\" Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research, wrote in a research note.\n\nSome analysts were relatively optimistic about the company's compliance outlook.\n\nDon Fandetti, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote that the \"bear case\" of prolonged regulatory pain doesn't appear to be playing out.\n\n\"We wouldn't be surprised if the stock recovers some of the steep losses,\" Fandetti wrote in a research note. \n\nStill, Discover's stock price \"will have an overhang until we get FDIC clarity,\" Fandetti wrote. Discover's stock price has sunk roughly 24% since last month, when it disclosed the looming FDIC action \u2014 and also revealed that it overcharged merchants for 16 years.\n\nGreene, the company's CFO, said that an investigation into the overcharging of merchants \"is nearing an end.\" The FDIC consent order isn't final yet but will be public when the agency releases it, he noted.\n\nThe agency's order is focused on prior years, Greene added, saying that \"there could be other regulatory follow-ups\" from the FDIC or other regulatory agencies.\n\nOwen said he doesn't expect major changes in corporate strategy, and that Discover executives are \"going to execute with the plan we have.\" The company runs a payments network that looks to compete with Visa and Mastercard, and it also offers credit cards, student loans, personal loans and mortgages. Its online bank also has a growing deposit portfolio thanks to higher interest rates.\n\n\"For the most part, we're going to stay the course,\" Owen said. \n\nThe team will also largely look the same \u2014 now that Discover has brought on new leaders in key roles as it looks to improve its regulatory standing. The company has a new chief information officer, a new general counsel and a new chief compliance officer. \n\nOwen said the firm has a \"good balance\" of Discover veterans who understand the business and \"new talent that has dealt with the compliance issues at other companies.\"\n\nDiscover has also added a board member with significant industry and regulatory experience: former BNP Paribas USA Chairman J. Michael Shepherd, who was previously a senior deputy comptroller of the currency.\n\nThe company in recent months has also hired more than 200 new compliance officers who have experience at \"other companies that have to deal with challenges similar to this,\" Owen said.\n\nREGULATION AND COMPLIANCE\nThreat of a regulatory smackdown looms at Discover\nDiscover's board has hired an executive search firm to help find a new CEO and is \"acting with urgency,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this is a great job,\" Owen said, adding that the board has a \"strong list\" of internal and external candidates.\n\n\"I think we'll get the right person in the role in a fairly quick manner,\" he added.\n\nErika Najarian, a UBS analyst, noted that Discover's decision to turn to an interim CEO contrasts with the quick selection of a permanent CEO by other banks that needed major compliance overhauls.\n\nThat list, she said, includes Wells Fargo and Citigroup.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"As Mexico\u2019s Senate celebrated the passage of a bill designed to curb the power of the National Electoral Institute (INE), the non-partisan and independent agency that oversees elections, the country took another step backward toward its decades-long authoritarian past. Despite corruption, violence, and inequality, Mexico has functioned as an electoral democracy for nearly three decades \u2014 with political competition and a vibrant civil society. Much of that success is due to the INE.\n\nUnder President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a pugnacious and charismatic leader who swept to power in 2018, Mexico\u2019s independent institutions are slowly losing their ability to serve as a counterweight to the executive. The latest attack on the INE may be L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s most brazen of all. Yet, the U.S. government has cautiously maneuvered to avoid losing Mexico\u2019s cooperation on vital domestic issues, particularly immigration along the southern border. However, failing to speak out emphatically against Mexico\u2019s steady march back toward authoritarianism \u2014 despite recent rhetoric about \u201cstanding up for democracy\u201d \u2014 comes with its own risks. An unstable or even autocratic Mexico could exacerbate domestic challenges, including the fight against the opioid epidemic, turbocharged by fentanyl, and relegate President Joe Biden\u2019s seemingly firm commitment to democratic governance to mere rhetorical bluster.\n\nThe INE and the demise of Mexico\u2019s hegemonic-party autocracy\nFor much of the 20th century, Mexico operated as a hegemonic-party autocracy with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) at the helm. In this system, elections were held regularly to deter dissent by party elites, ensure the controlled rotation of power, and publicly signal overwhelming support for the PRI.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the economic and political dynamics of Mexico had changed, making the PRI\u2019s grip on power less secure. The 1988 elections \u2014 the first serious electoral competition in Mexico \u2014 were marred by widespread fraud. Although the PRI claimed the presidency, the government established the precursor to INE in 1990, known as the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), in response to public outcry. In 1994, the IFE invited international observers (euphemistically called \u201cinternational visitors\u201d to assuage concerns that Mexico was being monitored by foreign actors) to be present in the lead-up to and on election day.\n\nInitially, the IFE maintained close ties to the PRI, but after reforms instituted in 1996, the watchdog gained independence from political mediation and was regarded highly throughout Mexico and abroad. It even served as a model for the establishment of similar bodies elsewhere and helped run elections, as was the case after Timor-Leste became an independent nation in 1999. In 2000, the IFE oversaw the transition of presidential power from the PRI to the National Action Party, breaking 71 years of PRI rule.\n\nSince 2000, the IFE (which became the INE in 2014 after reforms) has overseen three additional presidential elections \u2014 all of which have featured L\u00f3pez Obrador as a candidate. In the two elections he lost in 2006 and 2012, L\u00f3pez Obrador leveled allegations of fraud. In one of these elections, he attempted to establish a parallel presidency. In the third election \u2014 held most recently in 2018 \u2014 he won, with a promise to create an \u201cauthentic democracy,\u201d free of corruption and waste. By early 2021, he had zeroed in on a favorite target: the INE.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador vs. the INE\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has two obsessions \u2014 one regarding the past and another regarding the future \u2014 and both pivot around the INE. He long maintains a grudge against the INE for certifying the 2006 presidential election, which he lost by a razor-thin margin, and which despite his assertions of fraud, international observers viewed as reflective of \u201cthe legitimate will of the Mexican citizens.\u201d As to the future, the last thing that he wants to do at the swearing-in ceremony for Mexico\u2019s next president is place the presidential sash over the shoulders of an opposition president-elect and, in doing so, jeopardize the legacy of his so-called \u201cFourth Transformation\u201d and the survival of his pet projects and policies.\n\nMay 4, 2018\n\nMexico\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT & POLITICS\nMexico\nNora Claudia Lustig\n\nAugust 1, 1998\n\nMexico\n\nLATIN AMERICA & THE CARIBBEAN\nMexico\nMonica Serrano\n\nJune 1, 1998\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s aversion toward the INE transformed into action after the agency fined his MORENA party for campaign finance irregularities in 2018 and disqualified two of its gubernatorial candidates from running for office in 2021. Decrying the INE as \u201crotten,\u201d he put forth legislation to curb its ability to perform its most basic functions \u2014 namely, running free and fair elections. His motivation is purportedly to save money, yet elsewhere he has allowed spending and handouts to run rampant.\n\nIn the first iteration of the proposed reforms, L\u00f3pez Obrador sought to dissolve the nonpartisan INE and replace it with an elected body largely chosen by the executive, among other drastic changes. The initial proposal sparked widespread protest across Mexico in November 2022, leading L\u00f3pez Obrador to rail against the measure\u2019s opponents as \u201cmostly racist, classist and big hypocrites\u201d and organize counterprotests days later. Ultimately, these reforms failed to garner enough support in Congress.\n\nImmediately after the first proposal stalled, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s allies put forth a so-called \u201cPlan B,\u201d which would not change the INE\u2019s structure but would instead gut its budget and bandwidth, forcing the agency to cut staff and close offices across Mexico. These budgetary constraints will have downstream effects, hindering election officials\u2019 ability to update voter registration lists, issue voter identification cards, and train workers to staff polling precincts on election day. Plan B also restricts election officials\u2019 power to penalize candidates who violate campaign laws and punishes individuals who \u201cslander\u201d the government while disseminating election-related materials. What is considered slander in this context is unclear and undoubtedly open to manipulation. Moreover, the fact that this reform would be enacted just over a year before Mexico\u2019s next presidential elections is alone a cause for deep concern. The proposal has since passed the Lower House and Senate \u2014 heralding a victory for the president and another warning shot for the durability of Mexico\u2019s democracy.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s authoritarian impulses\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attack on the INE represents the latest action to undermine independent institutional capacity. This objective underpins many of his austerity measures, which have reduced institutional bandwidth and eviscerated governmental agencies, regulators, and independent and autonomous bodies, both in terms of budget and manpower. Promising to fight against \u201cthe mafia of power,\u201d the president regularly schedules \u201cpopular consultations\u201d for major initiatives, including the controversial (and expensive) scrapping of Mexico City\u2019s airport in favor of his proposal. These referendums seek to bypass Congressional approval, typically draw extremely low turnout, and the results are driven by MORENA strongholds. He also holds daily press conferences to speak directly to \u201cthe people,\u201d which often last over two hours. During this time, he harasses independent journalists and opponents of his political agenda as \u201ccorrupt cretins.\u201d\n\nWith allies across Congress who support his agenda, L\u00f3pez Obrador has taken aim at the judiciary and other independent bodies. He has also made a concerted effort to court the military and expand its role in public life and public policies, despite promises to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Mexico. And although he swept to power with a vow to end corruption and build a more equitable Mexico, his own social programs have been marred by allegations of misappropriated funds and \u201cdisguised clientelism.\u201d He has even appointed a controversial political figure to his administration who oversaw some of the PRI\u2019s most brazen acts of corruption in 1988.\n\nThus far, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s authoritarian acts have done little to dent his popularity \u2014 and he has for now met limited resistance from institutions designed to check his power. With a challenge of his INE proposal at the Supreme Court, it will not be long before the full scope of Mexico\u2019s institutional decay becomes clear.\n\nThe transactional approach of the Biden administration\nAlthough members of the U.S. Congress from both parties quickly criticized the attack on Mexico\u2019s election process, the Biden administration has responded too cautiously to L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s latest illiberal act. When the State Department eventually commented that \u201cwell-resourced, independent electoral systems and respect for judicial independence\u201d are signs of a \u201chealthy democracy,\u201d Mexico\u2019s president shot back on cue: \u201cthere is more democracy in Mexico than could exist in the United States.\u201d\n\nWhereas Biden and others quickly condemned democratic threats in Brazil, the administration\u2019s criticism of Mexico has been more muted. Among other reasons, the administration\u2019s reticence can be explained by its need to ensure Mexican collaboration on immigration \u2014 an area that remains a focus of sharp criticism from Republican politicians despite policies that tow closer to Trump-era strategies. By prioritizing other policy areas over institutional threats to Mexican democracy, the Biden administration risks having its own renewed commitments to democratic norms ring hollow and potentially exacerbating migration and transnational organized crime challenges down the road.\n\nRather than violent insurrection, it is often the slow, systematic cooptation of institutional checks on the executive that facilitates democracies\u2019 demise. Thus far, the Biden administration\u2019s public approach to Mexico has failed to push back against these warning signs. Without firm international condemnation, it\u2019s unlikely L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attack on the INE will be his last on Mexico\u2019s independent institutions before the 2024 presidential elections. Particularly as the United States and other countries in the Americas seek to fortify their own democracies, they ignore the threat to Mexico\u2019s independent institutions at their own peril. Authoritarian regimes around the world will reap the geopolitical, strategic, and ideological benefits of a less democratic and more insular Mexico.\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"ORLANDO, Florida, Aug 24 (Reuters) - What if Japan or China intervened in the foreign exchange market to sell dollars and support their currencies and liquidated U.S. Treasuries in the process - and the sky didn't fall down?\n\nIt would be a scenario hard to imagine even 10 years ago, but it's more plausible now because the world's top two holders of U.S. debt no longer pack the Treasury market punch they once did - either individually or even together.\n\nThe Japanese and Chinese central banks' combined footprint in the world's largest, deepest and most liquid government bond market is now its lowest on record, at least since comparable data began being collected in the late 1990s.\n\nTheir combined $2 trillion pile in June, the last month official U.S. Treasury data is available, equated to 7.8% of the $25 trillion outstanding marketable U.S. Treasuries, less than a third of the record 25.4% registered in June 2007.\n\nJapan's official stash of $1.11 trillion represents 4.4% of the total market, also a record low, while China's $835 billion stash is around 3.4% of the total, the lowest in over 20 years. In contrast, the Federal Reserve holds $5 trillion, or 20% of the overall market.\n\nTo be sure, Japan and China are still forces to be reckoned with. They are by some distance the world's top two holders of U.S. bonds, and China's stash is probably significantly larger when state banks, wealth funds and suspected holdings in third-party countries like Belgium and Britain are factored in.\n\nBut they don't bestride the Treasuries market like they once did, nor does the threat of them selling strike the same fear into bond investors, global markets at large, and even policymakers in Washington.\n\nThat wasn't the case in years gone by, certainly in the 2000s before the global financial crisis when Japan, oil exporters and emerging countries - especially China - recycled their huge trade surpluses into U.S. Treasuries to build up formidable foreign exchange reserves.\n\n\"No foreign central bank owns the bond market, so to speak. The market is basically driven by a set of bets on the Fed, not flows from any one country these days,\" said Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations.\n\nJapan and China were both buyers of Treasuries in June, the last month of available data. Valuation-adjusted data from Fed economists Carol Bertaut and Ruth Judson show that China and Japan added $8 billion and $6 billion to their respective stashes.\n\nChina's Treasuries holdings fell a valuation-adjusted $34 billion in the first half of the year, although its U.S. agency debt holdings rose nearly $20 billion. Japan's Treasuries stash increased by $40 billion while its agencies pile fell by $25 billion.\n\nForeign central banks' total stockpile of Treasuries rose $26.5 billion to $3.54 trillion in June, and by almost $100 billion in the first half of the year, Judson and Bertaut's figures show.\n\nThis ties in with official sector holdings of U.S. Treasuries parked with the Fed, which are up around $100 billion this year.\n\nThat's a lot, but nowhere near keeping pace with the increase in supply. The Fed continues to reduce its holdings by $60 billion a month, and U.S. Treasury issuance is exploding.\n\nJapanese yen near 50-year low\nReuters Image Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nChinese yuan at 10-year low\nReuters Image Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWith U.S. bond yields at their highest since the late 2000s, the widening yield gap is pushing the yuan and yen to historically low levels against the dollar. The yen's real effective exchange rate, or REER, is also near its lowest in 50 years, and the yuan's REER value is the lowest in a decade.\n\nSpeculation is rising that Beijing or Tokyo could soon dip into their Treasuries holdings to fund dollar-selling intervention in the currency market.\n\nTokyo is more likely to take the plunge, as it did last September and October. Its rounds of yen-supporting interventions were worth a record $60 billion and funded mostly via U.S. T-bills or short-dated bonds.\n\nChinese state-run banks, meanwhile, are mopping up excess yuan to keep the exchange rate \"basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level\" and Beijing has other liquidity-boosting and exchange rate-management tools to steady the currency without selling Treasuries.\n\nAt least for now.\n\n\"We do not yet see signs of Treasury sales for intervention purposes, but further dollar appreciation particularly vs the yuan and yen pose risks,\" Bank of America strategists wrote last week.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)\n\nReporting by Jamie McGeever; editing by Jonathan Oatis","labels":["geopolitical_issues","investments"]}
{"text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 UBS will pay U.S. authorities $1.44 billion to settle the last lingering legal case over Wall Street\u2019s role in the housing bubble of the early 2000s, which ultimately led to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nThe Swiss bank agreed to pay a civil penalty over how it handled the sale of 40 mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007. The settlement argues that UBS bankers gave false and misleading statements about the health of the mortgages in those bonds to the buyers in violation of federal securities law.\n\nFor example, UBS bankers knew that the underlying mortgages in these bonds were poorly underwritten or violated consumer protection laws. The bonds in question ended up with substantial losses for investors.\n\nWith the UBS settlement, the last remaining outstanding legal case from the Great Recession has now come to a close, the Justice Department said. Banks paid collectively more than $36 billion in civil penalties for their conduct related to the mortgage crisis, but that does not include other settlements that banks have made to state and local authorities as well.\n\nUBS said that it already had set aside funds for the settlement, so it will not impact its financial results.\n\nSeparately Monday, Swiss media reported that two groups acting on behalf of Credit Suisse shareholders filed suit in Swiss courts to argue that the sale price to UBS \u2013 around $3.25 billion \u2013 far undervalued the bank, and that UBS was able to unjustly profit from the deal.\n\nThe Swiss government hastily arranged the takeover in March of Credit Suisse, which had been facing years of turmoil and an exodus of shareholders, by longtime rival UBS to help avert a global financial crisis.\n\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"August 29 - I can\u2019t recall a moment in my life when Africa and its people haven\u2019t been impacted by climate change. Data shows that in 2020, nine out of the 10 countries most affected by climate change were African. East Africa this year faced the worst drought it has faced in four decades, bringing catastrophic impacts to Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe conclusion is simple: without climate change, such events would not have happened.\n\nAfrican countries have historically contributed far less to climate change than others, yet Africa has been impacted more severely. It is on the cusp of its own rapid industrialisation, yet it must do so while reducing its emissions.\n\nThis is a very different kind of growth paradigm to contend with. But Africa has the potential to tap a new kind of growth, which is enshrined in what is being called green growth. This wholly new type of economic growth needs new approaches to infrastructure development, the adoption of new kinds of technologies and energy, and importantly, a new approach to finance that can stimulate economic growth without impacting the planet.\n\n\nAfrican countries are stepping up to the challenge and are willing to try new approaches. We\u2019ve already seen healthy and ambitious pledges from various countries, but these countries also make it clear that they need support to fully fund these commitments from the international and multi-lateral communities.\n\nFor example, South Africa has set an emissions reduction target of 28% by 2030, as long as \u201cadequate international support will be provided\u201d. Similarly, Ghana has committed to a reduction of 15% by itself, or 30% if international support is made available.\n\n\nThe funding gap to achieve Africa\u2019s commitments is vast. Estimates show that the continent needs $2.8 trillion by 2030 to fully fund the commitments that have already been announced.\n\nThis is why we need to see close partnership across different sources of funding \u2013 from the international community, African domestic capital sources and from the private sector \u2013 to deliver the required financial impact.\n\nAs co-chair of the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), I believe there is significant untapped potential within Africa to take the lead on deploying this finance to create a greener future for the continent, while helping tackle the global climate crisis.\n\nOne example is The African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), which was launched last year at COP27.\n\nVoluntary carbon markets (VCMs) can help to channel billions in investment that can build vibrant, green economies, while also contributing towards global climate action. Companies purchase carbon credits, which are issued by African developers, companies, communities and governments and finance carbon-removal or reduction projects such as forest regeneration and renewable energy. These projects also deliver additional co-benefits for local livelihoods and biodiversity.\n\nAfrica\u2019s potential in the supply of high-quality carbon credits is vast. Ghana, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo are just a handful of countries that have proactively sought to build and scale their domestic carbon markets.\n\nThe Wider Image: Senegalese plant circular gardens in Green Wall defence against desert\nAn area that is part of the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel on the outskirts of Walalde department in Senegal. Carbon credits can be used to finance forest regeneration schemes such as the Great Green Wall, the aim of which is to slow desertification across Africa's Sahel region, the arid belt south of the Sahara Desert. Acquire Licensing Rights Read more\n\nWe are also seeing coordination across the continent. ACMI is focused on driving growth in Africa\u2019s voluntary carbon markets, fostering activity that reduces or removes substantial amounts of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by promoting African carbon credits, mobilising significant capital and creating millions of associated jobs in Africa by 2030.\n\nGiven that the Africa Climate Summit is being held in Nairobi this week, I want to reflect on what must fall into place so Africa can build a vibrant and well-capitalised VCM that supports green growth while meaningfully contributing to global climate action.\n\nIntegrity is the first pillar. We need to firmly root end-to-end integrity into the VCM system. The handshake between the buyers and the sellers of carbon credits is a key connection where responsibility, accountability and transparency can be forged. Guidance and frameworks for what governs integrity in the VCM are also critical.\n\nThere are tools to help with this. The Integrity Council\u2019s Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) provide a standard for what high-quality credits should follow when they are created, and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative\u2019s (VCMI) Claims Code of Practice is a rulebook for companies purchasing carbon credits, providing guidance on when and how voluntary carbon credits can be used, and the \u201cclaims\u201d buyers can make about their climate impact achievements while using these credits.\n\nCritically, companies should only purchase carbon credits in addition to measurable, science-based emissions reduction pathways. In other words, they should not be used to continue business-as-usual emissions. Developers, sellers, and traders of carbon credits need to integrate governance, emissions impact and sustainable development outcomes for credits sold.\n\nEveryone involved in the VCM must hold each other accountable. This will firmly root end-to-end integrity in the VCM, which will ultimately establish trust.\n\nA Masai herder walks with grazing cattle \n\nThe second piece is action. We have already seen examples of countries and initiatives leading the way. But we must see more action across state and non-state actors in Africa and globally.\n\nThe international donor community needs to help encourage capacity, providing technical assistance for African countries and project developers, as well as technologies and systems to drive registration, verification and reporting.\n\nBuyers should begin engaging with the guidance that exists and remain confident about the market. Corporate buyers making significant commitments will also drive countries and developers to shape high-quality supply.\n\nThe third piece is a favourable environment and investment framework at a country level, that sets the VCM up for success.\n\nAfrican countries also need to decide whether, why, how and when to engage with VCMs and other carbon finance mechanisms. The VCMI released a VCM Access Strategy Toolkit, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme, highlighting the role of high-integrity VCMs in global climate mitigation efforts, and how countries can use VCM finance to benefit broader sustainable development, climate and nature policy priorities.\n\nThe final pillar is transparency and equity. There is a real opportunity for the African VCM to be truly fair and equitable, where the price of credits reflects the underlying value, and the proceeds are shared equitably to include local communities, indigenous peoples and other key stakeholders who have the most to gain and potentially lose from these projects. The VCM should be a market that works for people and the planet.\n\nIf we are to succeed in our global climate ambitions, we need a truly transformational way to finance these ambitions. The VCM is one such tool in an arsenal of financial interventions available to drive climate action. Let\u2019s work together to fulfil its full potential.","labels":["financial_success"]}

Beijing and Huawei reject such suggestions.\n\n\"Huawei Portugal seeks protection of its legitimate interests and legal rights under the law as a company duly established in Portugal,\" Huawei replied to Reuters when asked about the lawsuit.\n\nThe justice ministry's portal Citius shows that the lawsuit was filed at the Lisbon Administrative Court on Aug. 31.\n\nHuawei told Reuters it hopes the court will \"remedy the multiple violations\" of its rights, and the \"significant detrimental impact on the company and its partners\" from the resolution.\n\nThe secretary of state for digitalisation, Mario Campolargo, who chairs the CSSC, told Reuters earlier that the deliberation in May was based on an independent, strict security assessment following European Union guidelines, and did not specifically target Chinese suppliers.\n\nThe assessment had warned of a \"high risk\" to security of networks involving 5G technology \"from suppliers or providers that are headquartered in a country where the government exercises control, interference or pressure on its activities in third countries\".\n\nIt also cited risks when the country is not an EU, NATO or OECD member.\n\nPortugal's main operators, Altice, NOS (NOS.LS) and Vodafone (VOD.L) have already said they would not use Huawei's equipment in 5G core networks.\n\nThe CSSC said it had not been notified of any legal action, and that the operators were already developing their respective implementation plans, \"mitigating threats and risks\" in line with the resolution, to be presented to the telecoms regulator ANACOM.\n\n\"(5G networks) should be scrutiniseable, transparent and reliable for the state, citizens and companies,\" it said.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations on Tuesday and the Google parent announced that its long-time CFO, Ruth Porat, would assume a new role while the company sought a new finance chief.\n\nAlphabet's results were helped by steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising. The shares jumped 8% in after-hours trading. Shares of rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) were down slightly after it also reported results on Tuesday, while shares of Meta Platforms (META.O), a company also highly dependent on ad sales, rose as much as 2%.\n\n\"Not only did Google deliver fantastic earnings per share, exceeding expectations at a time when investors were questioning its ability to keep up with other tech giants amid the AI frenzy, it also did so by a considerable margin,\" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. \"This strongly indicates that a new growth phase for the giant is likely under way.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google has finally consolidated itself as a leading force in the highly-disputed cloud sector and now has room to focus its expansion in the AI field.\"\n\nPorat, hired in 2015, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent female executives and oversaw tremendous growth at Alphabet. She will become chief investment officer and president starting Sept. 1 and lead 2024 planning while her successor is sought.\n\nPorat was hired from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), where she was finance chief. In her new role, she will oversee the company\u2019s so-called Other Bets portfolio, the unit for more risky hardware and services ventures, as well as help manage the company\u2019s global investments.\n\nAdvertisers, who make up a big share of Alphabet's revenue, have pulled back on spending precious dollars on untested platforms, helping the Google parent as well as Facebook owner Meta Platforms.\n\nBut Alphabet's second-quarter results are sure to please investors concerned over a broader advertiser pullback following the meteoric growth of Web services during the pandemic, as consumers returned to physical retail.\n\nSilicon Valley has been buzzing over generative artificial intelligence software that can give long-winded responses to user queries and is predicted to be the next leap forward for Big Tech. Alphabet rolled out AI products at its annual I\/O developer conference in May and it revamped its search engine to include generative AI.\n\nThe new AI technology comes at a cost: the largest component of Alphabet's second-quarter capital spending was for servers and a \"meaningful investment\" in AI computing, Porat said in a conference call.\n\nAdvertising is coming to the company's revamped search, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on the call. Alphabet is testing what formats are effective and where to place ads inside of its AI-powered search.\n\nPresently, 80% of advertisers use at least one AI-driven search product, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said on the call.\n\nThe company plans to integrate generative AI into other products such as Gmail, Google Photos and its Android mobile operating system. Generative AI tech can create text, images and video that resemble what people produce.\n\nStill, the results released on Tuesday show that ad sales are still king. Investors punished social media company Snap (SNAP.N) on Tuesday for its disappointing ad sales in the quarter.\n\nRevenue at Google Cloud, which is among the biggest cloud service providers, rose 28% to $8.1 billion, besting expectations of $7.75 billion, and maintaining roughly the same rate of growth as the first quarter. Microsoft's Azure revenue rose 26%, ahead of the growth estimate from Visible Alpha.\n\nAnalysts and industry experts have said they expect cloud business growth to pick up toward the end of the year, with quarter-ended June being the trough as macro uncertainty begins to clear.\n\nInvestors expect AI to become a major growth driver for cloud businesses within a year, with Microsoft's Azure leading the pack followed by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS and Google Cloud.\n\nAd sales for Google's YouTube video service unit rose 4.4% to $7.67 billion.\n\nAlphabet reported net profit of $1.44 per share for the April-June period, compared with estimates of $1.34 per share.\n\nRevenue for the quarter stood at $74.6 billion, compared with estimates of $72.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data.","labels":["financial_success"]}
{"text":"One of the more frustrating roadblocks in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic was the difficulty in getting quick, accurate test results. Sometimes, results for PCR tests took up to two weeks, rendering their diagnosis useless for planning isolation scenarios. Meanwhile, rapid tests still oftentimes provide a false negative if taken too soon after infection. When I had COVID, I was four days into symptoms before I got a positive at-home test\u2014I've heard many people recount similar stories.\n\nThe testing we have is certainly better than nothing, but it leaves a lot to be desired. If only there were a better way, say, using something with remarkable innate sensitivity. Like, dogs. Far-fetched? Not at all.\n\nA review of recent research concluded that scent dogs may represent a cheaper, faster, and more effective way to detect COVID-19 and could be a key tool in future pandemics. This could be a game-changer for sustainability as well, eliminating the enormous amount of waste that comes with billions of testing kits.\n\nThe review, published in De Gruyter's Journal of Osteopathic Medicine, found that scent dogs are as effective, or even more effective, than conventional COVID-19 tests such as PCR tests.\n\nMost of us know that dogs have a remarkable sense of smell; they sniff out drugs and explosives and have even successfully identified patients with certain cancers, Parkinson\u2019s, and diabetes. They have up to 300 million olfactory cells, compared to 5 or 6 million in humans. And they use one-third of their brains to process scent information\u2014humans just use 5%.\n\n 6 Medical Conditions That Dogs Can Sniff Out\nProfessor Tommy Dickey of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Heather Junqueira of BioScent Detection Dogs analyzed 29 different studies in which dogs detected COVID-19. \"The studies were performed using over 31,000 samples by over 400 scientists from more than 30 countries using 19 different dog breeds. In some studies, the scent dogs sniffed people directly, sometimes in public places as a health screening. In others, the dogs sniffed patient samples such as sweat, saliva, or urine samples,\" explains a press statement from De Gruyter.\n\nDogs' Incredible Accuracy\nThe dogs ranged from Labrador retrievers and Belgian malinois to beagles and English springer spaniels. In most of the studies, the dogs demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and specificity than the current gold-standard PCR tests or antigen tests.\n\n\"In one study, four of the dogs could detect the equivalent of less than 2.6 x 10\u221212 copies of viral RNA per milliliter. This is equivalent to detecting one drop of any odorous substance dissolved in ten and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools and is three orders of magnitude better than modern scientific instruments,\" notes De Gruyter.\n\nRemarkably, they not only detected COVID-19 in symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients, but they could also sniff out COVID variants and even long COVID.\n\nConsidering the Safety of the Dogs\nOne thing we certainly don't want is for dogs to become collateral damage in the pursuit of better testing. The study authors acknowledge this, writing that the \"safety of scent dogs, their handlers, and those who are inspected by the dogs is critical for the acceptance and implementation of the scent dog screening and testing approach.\"\n\n\"This is consistent with the One Health paradigm,\" they add, \"which defines health as more than the absence of disease and recognizes the interrelationships among humans, animals, and environmental welfare.\"\n\nThe authors evaluated whether medical detection dogs could contract and become ill with the COVID-19 virus and if dogs pass on the COVID-19 virus to humans. From a number of studies, they concluded that dogs are in the low-risk category. \"To our knowledge, there have been no deaths of dogs that can be unequivocally attributed to COVID-19,\" the authors explain. \"Importantly, the studies described above suggest that it is safe for healthy individual handlers to utilize scent dogs to directly screen and test individuals who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.\"\nSpeedy Test Results\nA major benefit of using the dogs is their speed. In one study, researchers were able to do a lineup with 40 samples, including sample collection, lineup loading, and unloading, within just 3\u202f minutes.\n\n\"The time between RT-PCR sampling and the return of results can be up to days, whereas the RAG test results are obtained within about 15\u202fmin.,\" write the study authors. \"Again, if scent dogs directly sniff individuals, results are learned in seconds, or a few minutes if samples are taken and sniffed soon after by the dogs.\"\n\n\"The criticality of the speed of the return of test results cannot be overemphasized,\" the authors add.\n\nElimination of Plastic Waste\nThat dogs could provide a result in seconds to minutes is crucial. But additionally, and importantly, scent tests by dogs don't require expensive lab equipment or create mountains of plastic waste, unlike conventional diagnostic approaches.\n\nAs of December 22, 2022, the United States alone had performed around 1.15 billion tests for COVID-19. Thinking of all the material for the testing kits and all the resources used for testing labs and sending samples around, etc., the reduction in ecological footprint is potentially tremendous.\n\nNot to mention the cost. Some of the research in the review was, in fact, motivated by the need for inexpensive testing in developing nations, the authors note.\n\n\u201cAlthough many people have heard about the exceptional abilities of dogs to help humans, their value to the medical field has been considered fascinating, but not ready for real-world medical use,\u201d says Dickey. \u201cHaving conducted this review, we believe that scent dogs deserve their place as a serious diagnostic methodology that could be particularly useful during pandemics, potentially as part of rapid health screenings in public spaces. We are confident that scent dogs will be useful in detecting a wide variety of diseases in the future.\"","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"Key takeaways\nApple stock prices fell some 27% in 2022.\nProduction problems in Chinese factories are putting downward pressure on stock prices.\nApple hit a $3 trillion valuation in January 2022. Since then, its valuation has fallen to less than $2 trillion.\nIn the last year, Apple stock has taken a tumble. Among the main problems causing the fall in stock prices are production issues that have plagued the company in recent months.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the production problems facing Apple.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening?\nIn 2022, Apple stock prices fell by around 27%. The significant drop took a big bite out of Apple\u2019s valuation. The company briefly hit a $3 trillion valuation early in 2022. But since then, Apple\u2019s value fell to just under $2 trillion before edging back up to the $2 trillion mark a day later.\n\nPROMOTED\n\n\nOf course, that still makes Apple a major company. In fact, it\u2019s currently the largest publicly-traded company in the world. However, falling stock prices at this large company are obviously still cause for concern among investors.\n\nThe tumultuous economic climate isn\u2019t doing Apple any favors. After all, most companies are seeing their stock prices take a hit as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and high inflation detracts from consumers\u2019 purchasing power. But many are pointing to Apple\u2019s production problems as the root cause of falling stock prices.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\nByAmy DaniseEditor\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\nByAmy DaniseEditor\nProduction problems\nWithout a product to sell, Apple cannot continue putting up impressive revenue numbers. Unfortunately for the company, it\u2019s been facing significant production problems for some top-selling products.\n\nInvesting Digest: Know what's moving the financial markets and what smart money is buying with Forbes Investing Digest.\n\nEmail address\nSign Up\nBy signing up, you accept and agree to our Terms of Service (including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions), and Privacy Statement.\niPhone manufacturing issues\nAlthough most of the world has eased up on pandemic restrictions, China has not. In the midst of country-wide protests, the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou has been unable to meet its production goals, in part due to worker unrest over issues of payment. Since this factory is where Apple produces the most iPhones, there has been a shortfall of the product.\n\nAccording to some reports, Apple might have a shortfall of six million iPhone Pro units on its hands. With a shortage of iPhones, some investors expect the company to report less revenue for the year. Fear of lower revenue is one common reason for a drop in stock price.\n\nRerouting the supply chain\nWith Foxconn producing around 70% of iPhones, Apple is relatively reliant on the Zhengzhou factory to meet its sales goals. After all, Apple can\u2019t earn money without selling its products to consumers.\n\nProtests across China have pushed back the timeline of iPhone production. And, of course, the company isn\u2019t thrilled about the situation. After months of protests, Apple is reportedly accelerating plans to move its production to other countries.\n\nReports that the company was looking to move its manufacturing outside of China surfaced in May 2022. But since then, the significant production delays and continued protests across China seem to have pushed Apple into action.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Apple is looking to shift production into countries like India and Vietnam. The move will distance Apple from the fallout of the Foxconn protests. Although details are sparse, some sources have reported that Apple may move up to 45% of iPhone production to factories in India.\n\nBut the reality of the situation is that Apple cannot wave a magic wand and seamlessly move production to another country. It may take years and billions of dollars to move iPhone production out of China.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest companies, Apple certainly has the resources to make the move. But the cost of moving might be too painful for some investors, which could lead to further drops in the stock price.\n\nImpressive revenue\nDespite the production problems and bumpy economic times, Apple is still putting up very impressive numbers. On October 27, Apple announced revenue of $90.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a record number.\n\nWith revenue up 8% from the same time last year, Apple\u2019s impressive numbers are a saving grace in the face of their production issues. The high revenue indicates that demand for Apple products is still incredibly strong.\n\nAs the company works to recalibrate its supply chain, strong customer demand will make the changes less painful. After all, demand for products outpacing supply isn\u2019t the worst problem for a company to have. Apple now faces the challenge of finding a way to keep up with the intense demand for its products.\n\nHow to invest in tech\nThe tech industry has faced many problems this past year. In addition to a wave of white-collar layoffs across the industry, many big tech companies have seen their stock prices go on a rollercoaster ride.\n\nAs an investor, it\u2019s challenging to optimize your portfolio in times of rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears. Even the largest company, Apple, is not immune to our current economic and geopolitical issues. And constantly monitoring the markets for changes isn\u2019t something every investor has the time or desire to do.\n\nOne way to streamline your portfolio management is to work with Q.ai\u2019s Investment Kits.

{"text":"August 24, 2023 | 2:54 P.M.\nTrucking company Old Dominion Freight Line\u2019s $1.5 billion bid to buy real estate from bankrupt trucker Yellow Corp. sets the stage for the auction of one of the largest portfolios of truck terminals in key North American markets to ever go on sale.\n\nOld Dominion\u2019s offer has been endorsed by Yellow as the preferred stalking-horse bid that sets the minimum price for the properties, according to bankruptcy court and regulatory filings, and tops an earlier $1.3 billion bid from rival Estes Express Lines.\n\nYellow, based in Nashville, Tennessee, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Aug. 6 after 94 years in business because of elevated debt levels from multiple acquisitions. The company owns nearly 170 truck terminals and warehouses in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Yellow properties would be a good fit with Old Dominion\u2019s existing footprint of truck terminals, said Jeff Diener, an attorney at BakerHostetler who is representing Old Dominion in the bidding process.\n\n\u201cThey present strategic value for Old Dominion,\u201d Diener told CoStar News in an interview.\n\nOld Dominion owns 231 truck terminals in the U.S., according to its annual report. Some of its largest terminals are in the Atlanta, Dallas, Indianapolis and Memphis, Tennessee, markets. If Old Dominion ends up buying all of Yellow's owned terminals, it would potentially expand Old Dominion's portfolio by more than 70% and establish its dominance in the less-than-truckload category of companies that carry shipments from multiple customers on the same truck.\n\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line hopes to combine Yellow's truck terminals with its existing network of properties, including this terminal in Greensboro, North Carolina. (CoStar)\nOld Dominion, the second-largest less-than-truckload company, is publicly traded and has been in business for 89 years. It has been one of the top-performing trucking company stocks in 2023 with shares having climbed 44% this year to $412.65. That compares to a 31% rise in the Dow Jones U.S. Trucking Index.\n\nAttorneys for Old Dominion think its offer for Yellow's properties is likely to prevail because of the company\u2019s financial strength and since its finances are publicly accessible, said Diener.\n\n\u201cOld Dominion has a very sophisticated team that\u2019s very experienced in real estate transactions,\u201d Diener said.\n\nPending Auction\nStalking-horse bids set a minimum price for the assets that a bankrupt company is trying to sell. Other companies can still submit bids for Yellow's real estate. Potential buyers must submit bids to the bankruptcy court by Oct. 15. An auction has been scheduled for Oct. 18.\n\nTerms of Old Dominion's stalking-horse agreement to purchase some or all of Yellow's real property include a breakup fee to be paid to Old Dominion of no more than $26 million if it's not selected as the winning bidder.\n\nOld Dominion must also prove that it's a \"credit worthy entity with cash and\/or financing commitments for the entire\" bid amount, and it must pay any and all transfer taxes and real estate closing costs, according to a court document.\n\nYellow has agreed to debtor-in-possession financing of at least $142.5 million from Citadel Advisors and MFN Partners to help fund operations and bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is one of Yellow's largest creditors due to a $700 million federal loan the company received during the pandemic.\n\nSingle Portfolio\nYellow\u2019s assets may also be broken up and sold as parts rather than as a single portfolio, according to court filings. But Old Dominion believes that Yellow\u2019s real estate is more valuable as a single portfolio than if the truck terminals and warehouses were sold individually, said Elizabeth Green, an attorney at BakerHostetler who is also representing Old Dominion.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether they\u2019re more valuable together or not,\u201d she told CoStar News. \u201cIf you pick out the plum properties from Yellow\u2019s portfolio, what do you do with the rest of it?\u201d\n\nYellow\u2019s truck terminals are located near interstate highways and are zoned for industrial uses, making the real estate more valuable than other available properties. Some of its owned terminals are located in key markets such as Chicago; Nashville; Portland, Oregon; and Columbus, Ohio. Yellow also leases more than 100 terminals.\n\nOld Dominion's bid came after accessing financial details and property data about Yellow\u2019s real estate portfolio through a confidential database established by Ducera Partners, one of Yellow\u2019s bankruptcy advisers. Companies interested in bidding on Yellow's portfolio that want to access the data are required to sign nondisclosure agreements, Green said.\n\nOld Dominion\u2019s offer does not include Yellow\u2019s trucks and trailers, Green said. Those assets will be sold separately in bankruptcy court.\n\n\nYellow's truck terminal in Columbus, Ohio, is for sale as part of the bankruptcy case. Yellow owns the Roadway trucking brand in addition to its namesake trucks. (CoStar)\nOld Dominion, based in Thomasville, North Carolina, and Estes, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, have not released details of their offers. Details of Old Dominion\u2019s offer will probably be filed with the court by Sept. 1 since Yellow has endorsed Old Dominion\u2019s offer as the stalking-horse bid, Green said.\n\nMichael Roeschenthaler, an attorney for Estes, said the company has no current plans to release additional financial terms of its offer. Estes is a privately owned company that also competes in the less-than-truckload market. Estes recorded about $5.1 billion in 2022 revenue compared to Old Dominion's $6.3 billion, according to company reports.\n\n\u201cWe are currently in negotiations with the debtor and the creditors\u2019 committee and cannot provide further information at this time,\u201d Roeschenthaler told CoStar News. His firm, Whiteford, Taylor & Preston, is legal counsel to Estes.\n\nA spokesperson for Estes declined to comment to CoStar News. Yellow did not respond to a request for comment from CoStar News.\n\nFor the Record\nKirkland & Ellis is serving as Yellow's lead restructuring law firm and Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones is the company\u2019s local counsel in Delaware. Alvarez & Marsal is the company\u2019s financial adviser. Creditors appointed to the official committee of unsecured creditors include BNSF Railway, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Michelin North America Inc., Daimler Trucks and RFT Logistics, among others. The proposed counsel for the official committee of unsecured creditors includes Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"The massive fluctuations in the freight industry over the last three years have been unprecedented. As well as the effects of COVID, port congestions, supply chain bottlenecks, energy cost rises, and geopolitical instabilities that exhibit no signs of ending.\n\nFreight procurement in this environment has become massively complex for shippers. As the number of business units, countries, products, suppliers, and customers increases, many discover that supply chain complexity is not linear (in line with business growth), but increases exponentially.\n\nGrowth in complexity tends to lead to higher costs \u2013 it takes time and effort for procurement teams to search for the best prices from standalone data sources, and manual processes are not only less efficient, but can also lead to cost sinks.\n\nMany companies still rely on manual workflows or generic platforms, which are not suited to address transportation complexity. Traditional tendering processes comprise email, Excel sheets, calls or texts to suppliers, or, more often, a combination of all the above. But by using technology, enterprises can move away from manual workload and reduce logistics costs.\n\nThe success story below reveals how digital freight procurement can empower logistics teams, while also receiving global recognition for bringing a unique value to the industry.\n\nSHIPSTA and Holcim were joint winners in the Best Procurement Technology Provider category at the 2022 World Procurement Awards. \u201cThanks to SHIPSTA, we have significantly increased our cost competitiveness on the tendered freight volume. We are managing our freight procurement more efficiently and our country teams are enabled to operate more strategically,\u201d said Alexander Scheld, Global Head of Logistics at Holcim.\n\nTight margins at scale\nHolcim Group, a Swiss multinational company manufacturing building materials, supplies low-cost-per-tonne materials for construction on a large scale and procures transportation to serve its multilingual customers in over 50 countries.\n\n\nTo handle its high volume of shipments, the company used to contract thousands of trucking providers on a spot or contract basis, executing tenders manually. Each regional market worked with its own supplier base, with the effect that the country-based teams had to manually compile data to get oversight of its logistics procurement.\n\nManual processes in multiple geographies inevitably create high costs. Plus, for the head office, it was difficult to formulate a longer-term strategy across the group without having reliable rate transparency. The answer to Holcim\u2019s situation was a technology that centralized freight operations, bringing logistics suppliers & procurement decision-makers together under one \u201cdigital\u201d roof to drive a cost-effective strategy.\n\nGlobal (and regional) execution power\nThe digital freight tendering platform from SHIPSTA allowed Holcim to easily execute tenders and analyse quotes from all suppliers at a glance, gaining actionable insights and higher supply chain visibility.\n\nDecision-makers at Holcim could choose the best carriers while addressing the specific requirements of each geographical market. \u201cWe wanted everything in one place to enable seamless integration between the supplier\u2019s quote and our ability to evaluate it,\u201d said Alexander Scheld, Global Head of Logistics at Holcim.\n\nHolcim took the wise decision to transform its freight procurement country by country, ensuring the digital procurement solution was rolling out successfully across all markets and business units.\n\nAs the project proceeded, instead of manually gathering quotes from calls, emails, and messages, every freight forwarder simply responded through SHIPSTA. Hundreds of carriers were smoothly onboarded to the platform and could respond automatically to requests-for-quotation (RfQs) when they were willing (and capable) of fulfilling the criteria.\n\nThis simplified the process for Holcim as a single point of oversight visible by decision-makers in each geography. In addition to securing better prices, Holcim\u2019s country teams now save hundreds of hours, moving from days to minutes to create complex RfQs, and gain higher execution power by procuring faster and data-driven.\n\nDespite operating in multiple markets, currencies, and languages, SHIPSTA\u2019s platform integrates Holcim\u2019s full logistics portfolio globally. It provides a central dashboard from which decision-makers can see market trends, execute quickly on the best prices and ensure competitive costs. With near real-time figures at their fingertips, Holcim\u2019s procurement teams can plan more accurately and call decisions with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nSHIPSTA\u2019s investment in UX & UI design makes it user-friendly also for suppliers to sign up quickly. The platform enabled Holcim to easily invite all its suppliers and run tenders in just a few minutes.\n\n\nRead more on SHIPSTA\u2019s website to find out how the digitalization of freight procurement can bring significant advantages to any industry or enterprise and request a demo to find out how it could improve your supply chain logistics today.","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a deep impact on transport connectivity in the region as documented in the recent ESCAP Policy Brief on Policy Reponses to Covid-19: Transport Connectivity in Asia and the Pacific. To prevent spread of the virus, within weeks, countries closed their borders to passenger transport and placed varying restrictions on freight transportation disrupting the supply chains. \n\nGovernments of the region need to respond to this pandemic appropriately by not only minimizing the short-term disruptions to transport linkages, but also viewing the crisis as an opportunity to revisit and reset the international freight transport operations towards a more sustainable path.\n\nOne major trend that has emerged in international freight transport in these challenging times is the increase in the number of freight trains between China and Europe. According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, freight trains between China and Europe increased by 15 per cent to 1,941 and number of containers transported by 18 per cent to 174,000 in the first quarter of 2020.  \n\nWhile all other modes of international freight transport have been adversely affected by the pandemic- the increase in freight carried by railways is not surprising, given its distinct features, that are working to its advantage in the current situation. \n\nInternational railway transport uses less manpower over long distance and accordingly there are fewer quarantine checks, unlike, for example, in road transport where congestions at border crossings cause more frequent human interactions.  Each freight train can carry between 40 to 70 times equivalent of lorry loads of goods in a much more safe and secure environment giving rail a distinct advantage. \n\nTraffic at a typical railway border crossing can also be managed much more effectively as compared to a road border crossing, thus the former has much less potential of spreading the virus due to transport process. \n\nAlso, for landlocked developing countries, the disruptions caused by the pandemic would be felt more acutely as they already suffer from high transport cost. International railway transport would be more effective for these countries in the current situation to minimize current disruptions and subsequent bounce back.\n\nTo meet the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic, international freight trains are being used to transport medical supplies and related equipment to many European countries. The railways of the region are also taking other measures to mitigate the impact caused by the pandemic as indicated on the websites of the mentioned railways. \n\nFor example, Russian Railways has set up an Emergency Response Center to support shippers and enhance coordination of all links in the transport chain to control spread of virus. Turkish Railways is undertaking freight transport with Iran without human contact and all freight trains are disinfected both before and after the trip. Uzbekistan Railways has developed a software for processing and providing preliminary electronic information to customs authorities for goods transported by rail.\n\nESCAP has engaged its member railways for many years to strengthen international railway transport. Its effort in this direction led to entry into force in 2009, an intergovernmental agreement on Trans-Asian Railway Network, that serves as a coordinated platform for development of railways in the region. \n\nTo facilitate railway transport along the network, in 2015, resolution 71\/7 Regional Cooperation Framework on Facilitation of International Railway Transport was adopted  by the member countries that identified key areas for cooperation among railways of the region to facilitate international railway transport. \n\nMore recently, at the Sixth Meeting of the Working Group on the Trans-Asian Railway Network, the importance of reducing the border crossing delays along the long-distance railway corridors was emphasized by taking action on four key issues. \n\nThese include (a) electronic information exchange between railways and among railways and control agencies; (b) harmonizing customs formalities for transit by rail; (c) dealing efficiently with break-of-gauge; and (d) developing comprehensive indicators and methodology to measure the performance of railway border crossing. \n\nESCAP is also supporting initiatives to commercialize railway corridors involving landlocked developing countries by developing corridor management mechanism(s) to increase coordination among the railways and other stakeholders along the corridor for efficient operations. \n\nConcrete action on these initiatives, over medium to long-run, would greatly enhance the efficiency of international freight trains and further reduce transport time as well cost and boost sustainability of international freight transport operations, helping the region \u201cbuild back better\u201d and shift to a new, more sustainable, \u201cnormal\u201d in the post-COVID-19 world. \n\nHistory is replete with challenges faced by the mankind and its resilience to come better out of them. The wide scale disruptions cause by the COVID-19 pandemic would undoubtedly make the path towards realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development more challenging. \n\nThe existing situation, therefore, should be leveraged by taking concrete policy measures to enhance reliability of international freight trains making them competitive and self-sustaining. This would augment sustainability of the freight transport networks and thereby support countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n \n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 American consumers and nearly every industry will be affected if freight trains grind to a halt next month.\n\nOne of the biggest rail unions rejected its deal Monday, joining three others that have failed to approve contracts over concerns about demanding schedules and the lack of paid sick time. That raises the risk of a strike, which could start as soon as Dec. 9 under a deadline that was pushed back Tuesday.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t take long for the effects of a rail strike to trickle through the economy. Many businesses only have a few days\u2019 worth of raw materials and space for finished goods. Makers of food, fuel, cars and chemicals would all feel the squeeze, as would their customers.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the commuters who would be left stranded because many passenger railroads use tracks owned by the freight railroads.\n\nThe stakes are so high for the economy that Congress is expected to intervene and impose contract terms on railroad workers. The last time U.S. railroads went on strike was in 1992. That strike lasted two days before Congress intervened. An extended rail shutdown has not happened for a century, partly because a law passed in 1926 that governs rail negotiations made it much harder for workers to strike.\n\nHere are some of the expected impacts of a rail strike:\n\n$2 BILLION A DAY\nRailroads haul about 40% of the nation\u2019s freight each year. The railroads estimated that a rail strike would cost the economy $2 billion a day in a report issued earlier this fall. Another recent report put together by a chemical industry trade group projected that if a strike drags on for a month some 700,000 jobs would be lost as manufacturers who rely on railroads shut down, prices of nearly everything increase even more and the economy is potentially thrust into a recession.\n\n\nAnd although some businesses would try to shift shipments over to trucks, there aren\u2019t nearly enough of them available. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimated that 467,000 additional trucks a day would be needed to handle everything railroads deliver.\n\nCHEMICALS RUN DRY\nChemical manufacturers and refineries will be some of the first businesses affected, because railroads will stop shipping hazardous chemicals about a week before the strike deadline to ensure that no tank cars filled with dangerous liquids wind up stranded.\n\nJeff Sloan with the American Chemistry Council trade group said chemical plants could be close to shutting down by the time a rail strike actually begins because of that.\n\nThat means the chlorine that water treatment plants rely on to purify water, which they might only have about a week\u2019s supply of on hand, would become hard to get. It would be hard for manufacturers to make anything out of plastic without the chemicals that are part of the formula. Consumers will also pay more for gasoline if refineries shut down, either because they can\u2019t get the ingredients they need to make fuel or because railroads aren\u2019t available to haul away byproducts like sulfur.\n\nChemical plants also produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so the supply of carbon dioxide that beverage makers use to carbonate soda and beer would also be restricted, even though the gas typically moves via pipelines.\n\nPASSENGER PROBLEMS\nRoughly half of all commuter rail systems rely at least in part on tracks that are owned by freight railroads, and nearly all of Amtrak\u2019s long-distance trains run over the freight network.\n\nBack in September, Amtrak canceled all of its long-distance trains days ahead of the strike deadline to ensure passengers wouldn\u2019t be left stranded in remote parts of the country while still en route to their destination.\n\nAnd major commuter rail services in Chicago, Minneapolis, Maryland and Washington state all warned then that some of their operations would be suspended in the event of a rail strike.\n\nFOOD FEARS\nIt would take about a week for customers to notice shortages of things like cereal, peanut butter and beer at the grocery store, said Tom Madrecki, vice president of supply chain for the Consumer Brands Association.\n\nAbout 30% of all packaged food in the U.S. is moved by rail, he said. That percentage is much higher for denser, heavier items like cans of soup.\n\nSome products, like cereal, cooking oils and beer, have entire operations built around rail deliveries of raw ingredients like grain, barley and peanuts, along with shipments of finished products.\n\nThose companies typically keep only two to four days\u2019 worth of raw ingredients on hand because it\u2019s expensive to store them, Madrecki said, and grocers also keep a limited supply of products on hand.\n\nMadrecki said big food companies don\u2019t like to discuss the threat of a rail strike because of worries about product shortages can lead to panic buying.\n\nHUNGRY HERDS\nAny disruption in rail service could threaten the health of chickens and pigs, which depend on trains to deliver their feed, and contribute to higher meat prices.\n\n\u201cOur members rely on about 27 million bushels of corn and 11 million bushels of soybean meal every week to feed their chickens. Much of that is moved by rail,\u201d said Tom Super, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, a trade group for the industry raising chickens for meat.\n\nThe National Grain and Feed Association said a rail strike now would hit pork and chicken producers in the southern U.S. hardest, because their local supply of corn and soybeans from this year\u2019s harvest is likely exhausted and they\u2019d have to ship feed by truck, dramatically increasing costs.\n\n\u201cThey only have so much storage. They can\u2019t go without rail service for too long before they\u2019d have to shut down the feed mills and they run into problems,\u201d said Max Fisher, the NGFA\u2019s chief economist.\n\nRETAIL RISKS\nJess Dankert, the vice president for supply chain at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said retailers\u2019 inventory is largely in place for the holidays. But the industry is developing contingency plans.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see, you know, canceling Christmas and that kind of narrative,\u201d Dankert said. \u201cBut I think we will see the generalized disruption of really anything that moves by rail.\u201d\n\nDavid Garfield, a managing director with the consulting firm AlixPartners, said a rail strike could still impact holiday items shipped to stores later in December, and would definitely hamper stocking of next season\u2019s goods.\n\nRetailers are also concerned about online orders. Shippers like FedEx and UPS use rail cars that hold roughly 2,000 packages in each car.\n\nAUTOMOBILE ANGST\nDrivers are already paying record prices and often waiting months for new vehicles because of the production problems in the auto industry related to the shortage of computer chips in recent years.\n\nThat would only get worse if there is a rail strike, because roughly 75% of all new vehicles begin their journey from factories to dealerships on the railroad. Trains deliver some 2,000 carloads a day filled with vehicles.\n\nAnd automakers may have a hard time keeping their plants running during a strike because some larger parts and raw materials are transported by rail.\n\n","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"Cineworld Group Plc today filed a disclosure statement and plan of reorganization as the company took steps to bring its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to a conclusion. Cineworld filed for Chapter 11 on Sept. 7, 2022 in the Southern District of Texas (Houston).\n\nThe reorganization plan follows the outline agreed to by the company and an ad hoc group of lenders on April 2 and detailed in a restructuring support agreement (RSA). The company said today that, as with the RSA, the filed reorganization plan has the support of holders of 83% of the company\u2019s $3.9 billion of debt under its \u201clegacy facilities\u201d (namely term loans due 2025 and 2026 along with a revolver due 2023) and holders of 69% of its $1.94 billion DIP facility. The official creditors\u2019 committee is also on board.\n\nVoting on the plan documented by the disclosure statement is scheduled to end on May 23. The confirmation hearing is set for May 26.\n\nIn general, the plan is for Cineworld to reduce its outstanding debt by around $4.53 billion. The plan sees the company raising $1.46 billion in new first-lien exit financing, plus $800 million to be generated by selling 72.32% of newly issued common stock (before management incentive plan dilution), $400 million of which will be backstopped by legacy facility debt holders. Cineworld will also enter into a new $200 million revolver.\n\nRegarding recoveries, the DIP loan now in place will be repaid in full, in cash. Legacy facility claims will receive projected recoveries of around 3.4%, according to the disclosure statement. General unsecured claims will receive recoveries of 0.5-1.3%, while holders of interests in the Cineworld parent company, including common stock, will receive no recovery, the document shows. A $10 million litigation trust is also being established.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy, Cineworld embarked on a sales process in an attempt to sell some, or all, of its assets. The company received no all-cash bids for the entire business. Cineworld, its advisers and an ad hoc lender group believed that only an all-cash bid for the entire business \u201csignificantly in excess of the valuations underpinning the [RSA] transactions\u201d would be of greater interest than the restructuring now documented by the filed plan of reorganization, according to the disclosure statement. \n\nBut the sales process is continuing for the company\u2019s \u201crest of world\u201d business, including operations in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Israel. That process expected binding offers to be submitted by April 10, and foresees bidding procedures set by April 24, an auction on May 10 if multiple bids are received, and a definitive agreement signed two days later. The reorganization plan assumes the new exit financing facility will be reduced by net sales proceeds, if any.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Emmanuel Macron, accompanied by top French business executives, concluded his trip to China on Friday with a visit to the southern city of Canton, where he met with more Chinese investors. With trade talks on the agenda, several deals between companies from both countries have already been sealed during the French president\u2019s first visit to China since the Covid-19 pandemic. A French economist shares with FRANCE 24 her insight on the concerns surrounding trade ties between Paris and Beijing.  \n\nBusiness is in the air as Airbus announced on Friday that it would deliver 50 helicopters to GDAT, one of China's largest helicopter lessors. The announcement was made only a day after Airbus pledged to double production in China by setting up a second assembly line at its Tianjin plant. Meanwhile, French national electricity company \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF) renewed its contract with Chinese energy giant China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN). Cosmetics leader L\u2019Or\u00e9al sealed a deal with e-commerce platform Alibaba on \u2018sustainable consumption\u2019 while water and waste management company Suez clinched a desalination contract with China\u2019s Wanhua chemical.  \n\nThis series of freshly inked business deals, highlighted by Macron\u2019s trip to China, seems to show France\u2019s positive outlook on business in China. FRANCE 24 talked to Mary-Fran\u00e7oise Renard, an economics professor at the University of Clermont Auvergne and director of the Institute of Research on China\u2019s Economy, to shed light on current Sino-Franco trade relations.  \n\nFRANCE 24: What kind of signals do these business deals send? Do they represent a broadening of current trade relations between Paris and Beijing?   \nMary-Fran\u00e7oise Renard: It\u2019s a good sign, of course! It means that businesses are going smoothly for French companies in China, so it\u2019s good news. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily represent significant changes to current trade relations between France and China as the recently sealed deals are prepared a long time in advance. Despite this being President Macron\u2019s first visit since 2019 to China, commercial transactions between the two nations have never ceased during this period. We did, indeed, witness throughout the past three years a slowing down due to constraints imposed by the pandemic, during which China shut down its borders. But it\u2019s part of the global trend, economic activities across countries decreased in the same period. We\u2019re really just picking up where we left it before Covid.  \n\nDespite a generally positive outlook, several industry players have cited concerns over continuing to conduct business in China and advocate for a more cautious approach. Do you share such concerns?   \nThe concerns [of French businesses trading with China] are well grounded. There is a greater risk due to the current geopolitical climate as well as increasing interventions from the Chinese Communist Party. Government intervention has already been heavily present in China, but it has become much more prominent [China\u2019s government has imposed party units in private companies since 1993, a policy that has expanded under Xi Jinping]. Companies are left with little wiggle room, which inevitably leads to a certain cautiousness, even wariness that was much less noticeable in the past.  \n\nDoes that mean that only multinationals and large corporations can afford to take the risk of trading with China?  \nI would like to point out a particularity in France\u2019s industrial fabric, which is far from being new: France has a lot of large companies and a lot of small companies. What we don\u2019t have are medium-sized companies, contrary to Germany, for example. And it\u2019s much riskier for a small company to export goods, especially to China. The company would need to hire export managers with good knowledge of China\u2019s market and know-how, which can be very costly. It\u2019s much easier for large corporations, which already have the necessary resources at hand and can, eventually, afford to fail. Unfortunately, due to structural reasons and the current economic conjuncture, France does not have medium-sized companies that can also afford to take on such a risk.  \n\nAccording to statistics published by French customs, France\u2019s trade deficit vis-\u00e0-vis China continued to widen to \u20ac39.6 billion in 2021, a now decades-long trend. Is there any potential improvement in sight?   \nFrance\u2019s trade deficit is essentially due to the structure of the country\u2019s foreign trade. We export various services to China which award us with surpluses (\u20ac6.1 billion in 2021), but we import a lot more goods (\u20ac77.7 billion in 2021) which ultimately leads to a deficit in our trade balance with China. And the widening of our trade deficit is partly the result of recovering household consumption in France as well as growing industrial output, which drove the demand of imported materials. Structurally speaking, France suffers from a lack of competitiveness on goods for household consumption, such as electronics, clothing and other daily-use products. The deficit is here to stay, and [it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing] if we hope to maintain the current level of household consumption.  \n\nThe World Trade Organization on Wednesday published a report forecasting a global decrease in trade growth to 1.7% for this year. How much would this impact trade between Paris and Beijing?  \nOf course, we cannot exclude extraordinary events, or in any case, events that occur earlier than predicted such as the Ukraine war. But in the current context of things, it is very likely that we will witness a slowing down of business transactions between France and China due to high inflation, growing geopolitical tensions and protectionist policies set in place by the US.\n\nPart of the US\u2019s protectionist policies can be found in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed last August that openly targets China.  Do you think this divide might bring Europe and China closer?  \nIt\u2019s very hard to predict. The US\u2019s policies would probably not directly alter Europe\u2019s economic strategies towards China. The latter would most certainly attempt to profit and seduce Europe, as the US\u2019s IRA alienates even its European partners.

{"text":"After years of battling supply chain issues, the automotive industry began to turn the corner in the first half of 2023, as many expected. However, Ford continues to battle various problems and shortages, along with a tight labor market, which is precisely why CEO Jim Farley previously stated that he believes supply chain problems are more of a permanent thing rather than a temporary storm that will pass at some point. While speaking at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference recently, Ford CFO John Lawler shed some more light on this topic by revealing that while supply chain issues are easing, they\u2019re still posing problems for The Blue Oval.\n\n\u201cYes. So, we are seeing disruptions due to supply availability, but it\u2019s much less than it was in the past,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cThere\u2019s still hiccups in chips, high demand chips that\u2019s happening. And the other thing that we\u2019re seeing is that as the water level overall is rising and production is coming back, we\u2019re seeing some of the suppliers that are not chip related having issues keeping up, ramping up to average per week volumes, max per week volumes. And so, we\u2019re working through some of those issues. And I think that\u2019s still part of the overhang from COVID and the fact that factories weren\u2019t running at that rate, maintenance wasn\u2019t necessarily where it should be, labor shortages, etc. But we\u2019re working through that, and it\u2019s getting much better.\u201d\n\nLawler\u2019s comments coincide with what we\u2019ve seen from Blue Oval production thus far this year, with many models seeing a sharp ramp up in that regard over the past few months. That list includes the the Ford Bronco Sport crossover, the Ford Transit van, the Ford Mustang Mach-E EV crossover, the refreshed Ford Escape crossover, and the Ford Maverick compact pickup.\n\nAs Ford Authority reported last week, even the Ford Bronco is facing no new supply constraints, which is big news for the in-demand SUV. However, some other red hot models \u2013 such as the Maverick Hybrid \u2013 remain constrained as demand still outweighs Ford\u2019s production capacity.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more on the state of the automotive supply chain soon, so be sure and subscribe to Ford Authority for 24\/7 Ford news coverage.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}

{"text":"On September 29, 2021, the United States and the European Union\u2019s (EU) new Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held their first summit. It took place in the old industrial city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under the leadership of the European Commission\u2019s Vice-President, Margrethe Vestager, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Following the meeting, the U.S. and the EU declared their opposition to artificial intelligence (AI) that does not respect human rights and referenced rights-infringing systems, such as social scoring systems.1 During the meeting, the TTC clarified that \u201cThe United States and European Union have significant concerns that authoritarian governments are piloting social scoring systems with an aim to implement social control at scale. These systems pose threats to fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, including through silencing speech, punishing peaceful assembly and other expressive activities, and reinforcing arbitrary or unlawful surveillance systems.\u201d2\n\nThe implicit target of the criticism was China\u2019s \u201csocial credit\u201d system, a big data system that uses a wide variety of data inputs to assess a person\u2019s social credit score, which determines social permissions in society, such as buying an air or train ticket.3 The critique by the TTC indicates that the U.S. and the EU disagree with China\u2019s view of how authorities should manage the use of AI and data in society.4 The TTC can therefore be viewed as the beginning steps towards forming an alliance around a human rights-oriented approach to the development of artificial intelligence in democratic countries, which contrasts with authoritarian countries such as Russia and China. However, these different approaches may lead to technological decoupling, conceptualized as national strategic decoupling of otherwise interconnected technologies such as 5G, hardware such as computer chips, and software such as operating systems. Historically, the advent of the world wide web created an opportunity for the world to be interconnected as one global digital ecosystem. Growing mistrust between nations, however, has caused a rise in digital sovereignty, which refers to a nation\u2019s ability to control its digital destiny and may include control over the entire AI supply chain, from data to hardware and software. A consequence of the trend toward greater digital sovereignty\u2014which then drives the trend further\u2014is increasing fear of being cut off from critical digital components such as computer chips and a lack of control over the international flow of citizens\u2019 data. These developments threaten existing forms of interconnectivity, causing markets for high technology to fragment and, to varying degrees, retrench back into the nation state.\n\nTo understand the extent to which we are moving towards varying forms of technological decoupling, this article first describes the unique positions of the European Union, United States and China concerning regulation of data and the governance of artificial intelligence. The article then discusses implications of these different approaches for technological decoupling, and then discusses implications for specific policies around AI, such as the U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act, the EU\u2019s AI Act, and China\u2019s regulation of recommender engines.\n\nEurope: A holistic AI governance regime\nThe EU has, in many ways, been a frontrunner in data regulation and AI governance. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018, set a precedent for regulating data. This is seen in how the legislation has inspired other acts, e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL). The EU\u2019s AI Act (AIA), which could go into effect by 2024, also constitutes a new and groundbreaking risk-based regulation of artificial intelligence, which, together with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA), creates a holistic approach to how authorities seek to govern the use of AI and information technology in society.\n\nThe EU AI Act establishes a horizontal set of rules for developing and using AI-driven products, services, and systems within the EU. The Act is modelled on a risk-based approach that moves from unacceptable risks (e.g., social credit scoring and use of facial recognition technologies for real-time monitoring of public spaces), to high risk (e.g., AI systems used in hiring and credit applications), to limited risk (e.g., a chatbot) to little or no risk (e.g., AI-enabled video games or spam filters). While AI systems that pose unacceptable risks are outrightly banned, high-risk systems will be subject to conformity assessments, including independent audits and new forms of oversight and control. Limited risk systems are subject to transparency obligations, such as user-facing information when interacting with a chatbot. In contrast, little or no risk systems remain unaffected by the AI Act.5\n\nThe EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) attempts, among other things, to ensure that digital platforms that possess so-called gatekeeper functions, in their access to and control of large swaths of consumer data, do not exploit their data monopolies to create unequal market conditions. The implicit goal is to increase (European) innovation, growth, and competitiveness.\n\nSimilarly, the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) seeks to give consumers more control over what they see online. This means, for example, better information about why specific content is recommended through recommender engines and the possibility of opting out of recommender-based profiling. The new rules aim to protect users from illegal content and aim to tackle harmful content, such as political or health-related misinformation. In effect, this carves out new responsibilities for very large platforms and search engines to engage in some forms of content moderation. This means that gatekeeper platforms are considered responsible for mitigating against risks such as disinformation or election manipulation, balanced against restrictions on freedom of expression, and subject to independent audits.\n\nThe aim of these new laws is not only to ensure that the rights of EU citizens are upheld in the digital space but also to make sure that European companies have a better opportunity to compete against large U.S. tech firms. One way of doing this is to mandate compatibility requirements between digital products and services. Such compatibility requirements have already required Apple to change the standard of its charger starting in 20246 and could also require greater interoperability between messaging services such as Apple\u2019s iMessage, Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Chat, and Microsoft Teams.7 While increased interoperability could increase the vulnerability and complexity of security-related issues, instituting such changes would arguably make it harder for companies to secure market share and continue their network-driven forms of dominance.\n\nAt the same time, the EU is trying to build ties to U.S. tech companies by opening an office in the heart of Silicon Valley headed by Gerard de Graaf, the European Commission\u2019s director of digital economy, who is expected to establish closer contact with companies such as Apple, Google, and Meta.8 The strategic move by the EU is also going to serve as a mechanism to ensure that American tech companies comply with new European rules such as the AIA, DMA, and DSA.\n\nConcerning semiconductors, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the European Chips Act in February 2022, intending to make the EU a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.9 By 2030, the European share of global semiconductor production is expected to more than double, increasing from 9 to 20%. The European Chips Act is a response to the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and China\u2019s ambitions to achieve digital sovereignty through the development of semiconductors. Semiconductors are the cornerstone of all computers and, thus, are integral for developing artificial intelligence. Strategic policies such as the European Chips Act suggest that control over the computer-based part of the AI value chain and the politicization of high-tech development will only become more important in coming years.\n\nThe largest tech companies\u2014Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others\u2014are mostly found in the U.S. and China, not in Europe. To address this imbalance, the EU aims to set the regulatory agenda for public governance of the digital space. The new regulations aim to ensure that international companies comply with European rules while strengthening the EU\u2019s resolve to obtain digital sovereignty.\n\nUS: A light-touch approach to AI governance\nThe United States\u2019 approach to artificial intelligence is characterized by the idea that companies, in general, must remain in control of industrial development and governance-related criteria.10 So far, the U.S. federal government has opted for a hands-off approach to governing AI in order to create an environment free of burdensome regulation. The government has repeatedly stated that \u201cburdensome\u201d rules and state regulations often are considered \u201cbarriers to innovation,\u201d1112 which must be reduced, for example, in areas such as autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nThe U.S. also takes a different approach than the EU and China in the area of data regulation. The U.S. has not yet drawn up any national policy on data protection, such as in the EU, where in 2018 the GDPR introduced a harmonized set of rules across the EU. By comparison, only five out of 50 U.S. states\u2014California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia\u2014have adopted comprehensive data legislation.13 As a result, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective in 2020, has, to some extent, become the U.S.\u2019s de facto data regulation.14 The GDPR in many ways served as a model for CCPA, which requires companies to give consumers increased privacy rights, including the right to access and delete any personal data as well as the right to opt-out of having data sold and be free from online discrimination.\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects platforms from liability for content posted. Under current law, liability for content remains with users who post it.15 In part due to this focus on users rather than platforms, in the U.S. there is little oversight of recommender engines that rank, organize, and determine the visibility of information across search engines and social media platforms. Content moderation is a thorny issue, however. On the one hand, there is an argument to be made for platforms to engage in content moderation to avoid overly discriminatory and harmful behavior online. On the other hand, states such as Texas, and Florida, among others, are passing laws prohibiting tech companies from \u201ccensoring\u201d users, which are enacted to protect their constituents\u2019 rights to free speech.16 The counterargument made by platforms is that their content moderation decisions, as well as their use of recommender engines, is a form of expression that should be protected by the First Amendment, which defends American citizens and companies from government restraints on speech.17\n\nWhile the United States takes a laissez-faire approach to regulating artificial intelligence, that tends to be fragmented at the state level, new industrial policy initiatives are aimed explicitly at strengthening certain aspects of the AI supply chain. One example is the CHIPS and Science Act, where Democrats and Republicans have come together to create new incentives for producing semiconductors on American soil.18 Based on the idea of digital sovereignty, the CHIPS and Science Act marks a shift in U.S. industrial policy to address renewed concerns over maintaining U.S. technological leadership in the face of fast-growing competition from China.\n\nWhen it comes to using artificial intelligence in the public sector, the United States has experienced significant opposition from civil society, especially to law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition technologies (FRT), for example, from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).19 Again, the U.S. approach has been fragmented. Several cities\u2014such as Boston, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, and Portland\u2014have banned government agencies, including the police, from using FRT. \u201cIt does not work. African Americans are 5-10 times more likely to be misidentified,\u201d said Alameda Council member John Knox White, who helped ban facial recognition in Oakland in 2019.20\n\nIn the United States, a March 2021 report by the country\u2019s National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) defined the \u201cAI race\u201d (between China and the United States) as a value-based competition in which China must be seen as a direct competitor.21 In the report, NSCAI went further and recommended creating so-called \u201cchoke points\u201d that limit Chinese access to American semiconductors to stall progress in some areas of technological development.22 Some of these \u201cchoke points\u201d were seen in August 2022, when the U.S. Department of Commerce banned Nvidia from selling its A100, A100X, and H100 computer graphics processing units (GPUs) to customers in China, in a move intended to slow China\u2019s progress in semiconductor development and prevent advanced chips from being used for military applications in China. The Department of Commerce justified the move by saying it was meant to \u201ckeep advanced technologies out of the wrong hands,\u201d while Nvidia has signaled that it will have serious consequences for its global sales of semiconductors.23\n\nOver the years, however, many Chinese researchers have contributed to important breakthroughs in AI-related research in the United States. U.S. companies such as Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), headquartered in Beijing, have also played a crucial role in nurturing Chinese talent in AI. Several former MSRA researchers have gone on to spearhead China\u2019s technological development in leading companies such as Baidu.24 Against the background of growing mistrust between the United States and China, these forms of cooperation are suffering, resulting in rethinking existing ties in areas of technological collaboration.\n\nOver the long run, ongoing technological decoupling could contribute to a bifurcation of digital ecosystems. The Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s (BIS) Entity List arguably contributes to these developments by blacklisting entities on the list from doing business with U.S. enterprises. In terms of software, these developments are already happening. Google, for example, stopped providing access to its Android operating system (OS) to Huawei after the company was placed on the Entity List. These developments caused Huawei\u2019s sales of smartphones to plummet on international markets due to a sudden lack of access to Android\u2019s (OS) and app store, hurting interoperability between hardware and apps and services.25 These developments have resulted in Huawei doubling down on developing its own proprietary operating system, HarmonyOS, for use across its products.26\n\nIn terms of AI-related regulation, the U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act was reintroduced in 2022, but it has not been approved in either the Senate or the House of Representatives, where it was first introduced in 2019. Should the Act be passed, it would require companies that develop, sell, and use automated systems to be subject to new rules related to transparency and when and how AI systems are used. In the absence of national legislation, some states and cities have started to implement their own regulations, such as New York City\u2019s Law on Automated Employment Decision Tools. The law stipulates that any automated hiring system used on or after January 1, 2023, in NYC, must undergo a bias audit consisting of an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor, including testing to assess potential disparate impact on some groups.27\n\nChina: a budding AI governance regime\nChina\u2019s approach to AI legislation is evolving rapidly and is heavily based on central government guidance. Implementing China\u2019s national AI strategy in 201728 was a crucial step in moving the country from a lax governance regime to establishing stricter enforcement mechanisms across data and algorithmic oversight. In 2021, China implemented the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), a national data regulation inspired by the GDPR. PIPL entails that companies operating in China must classify and store their data locally within the country\u2014an element critical in establishing digital sovereignty. Under the law, companies that process data categorized as \u201csensitive personal information\u201d must seek separate consent from these individuals, state why they process this data, and explain any effects of data-related decision-making. Like the GDPR, PIPL gives China\u2019s consumers increased rights while companies have become subject to stricter national oversight and data-related controls, enhancing trust in the digital economy.\n\nIn terms of AI regulation, China oversees recommender engines through the \u201cInternet Information Service Algorithmic Recommendation Management Provisions\u201d29 which went into effect in March 2022, the first regulation of its kind worldwide. The law gives users new rights, including the ability to opt-out of using recommendation algorithms and delete user data. It also creates higher transparency regarding where and how recommender engines are used. The regulation goes further, however, with its content moderation provisions, which require private companies to actively promote \u201cpositive\u201d information that follows the official line of the Communist Party. It includes promoting patriotic, family-friendly content and focusing on positive stories aligned with the party\u2019s core values.30 Extravagance, over-consumption, antisocial behavior, excessive interest in celebrities, and political activism are subject to stricter control: Platforms are expected to intervene actively and regulate this behavior.31 Therefore, China\u2019s regulation of recommendation algorithms goes far beyond the digital space by dictating what type of behavior China\u2019s central government considers favorable or not in society.\n\nUnlike the United States, Chinese regulations put the responsibility on private companies to moderate, ban, or promote certain types of content. However, China\u2019s regulation of recommender engines can be complicated\u2014both for companies to implement and for regulators to enforce\u2014because the law often may be interpreted arbitrarily.32 The regulation could further accelerate the decoupling of practices for companies operating in China and international markets.\n\nIn terms of innovation, China\u2019s central government has strengthened private partnerships with China\u2019s leading technology companies. Several private companies, including Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei, and SenseTime, among others, have been elevated to \u201cnational champions\u201d or informally to members of China\u2019s \u201cnational AI team\u201d33 responsible for strengthening China\u2019s AI ecosystem.34\n\nThe result is that technology giants such as Baidu, Alibaba, and others have moved into the upper echelons of China\u2019s centrally planned economy. And precisely because of these companies\u2019 importance to the social and economic development of the country, the government is bringing them closer to the long-term strategic goals of the Communist Party. These developments include experimenting with mixed forms of ownership, for example where government agencies acquire minority stakes in private companies through state-run private equity funds and then fill board seats with members of the Communist Party.35 Other measures include banning sectors that do not live up to the Party\u2019s long-term priorities. One of these was China\u2019s for-profit educational technology sector, which was banned in 2021 because the party wanted to curb inequality in education.36\n\nIn China, the state is playing a central and growing role in adopting facial recognition technologies to monitor public spaces. According to Chinese government estimates, up to 626 million facial recognition cameras were installed in the country by 2020.37 Huge public sector demand has not surprisingly contributed to making China a world leader in developing AI related to facial recognition. Meanwhile, pushback by civil society continues to play a marginal role in China compared to the United States, which makes it more difficult for the population to question the government\u2019s use of AI in society.\n\nWhile the U.S. and the EU only recently have launched new initiatives and industrial policies explicitly aimed at semiconductors, China has long nurtured its chip industry. In 2014, for instance, the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund was established to make China a world leader in all segments of the chip supply chain by 2030.38 While China still lags far behind the U.S in semiconductor development, it is an area of the AI value chain that receives continued attention from China\u2019s central government, as it is critical for the country\u2019s ambitions of achieving AI leadership by 2030.\n\nRegarding how AI intersects with social values, China\u2019s latest five-year plan states that technological development aims to promote social stability.39 Artificial intelligence should therefore be seen as a social control tool in \u201cthe great transformation of the Chinese nation,\u201d40 which implies maintaining a balance between social control and innovation.41\n\nThe desire for self-sufficiency\nThe ideological differences between the three great powers could have broader geopolitical consequences for managing AI and information technology in the years to come. Control over strategic resources, such as data, software, and hardware has become paramount to decisionmakers in the United States, the European Union, and China, resulting in a neo-mercantilist-like approach to governance of the digital space. Resurfacing neo-mercantilist ideas are most visible in the ways that trade in semiconductors is being curtailed, but they are also apparent in discussions over international data transfers, resources linked to cloud computing, the use of open-source software, and so on. These developments seem to increase fragmentation, mistrust, and geopolitical competition, as we have seen in the case of communication technologies such as 5G. The United States, Canada, England, Australia, and several European countries have excluded Chinese 5G providers, such as Huawei and ZTE, due to growing mistrust about data security and the fear of surveillance of citizens by China\u2019s central government.42\n\nAs technological decoupling deepens, China will seek to maintain its goal of achieving self-sufficiency and technical independence, especially from high-tech products originating in the United States. As recently as May 2022, China\u2019s central government ruled that central government agencies and state-subsidized companies must replace computers from foreign-owned manufacturers within two years.43 That includes phasing out Windows OS, which will be replaced by Kylin OS, developed by China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology.\n\nRegarding open-source code repositories such as GitHub (owned by Microsoft), China has also signaled that it seeks to diminish its reliance on foreign-developed open-source software. In 2020, for instance, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) publicly endorsed Gitee as the country\u2019s domestic alternative to GitHub.44 While the development of leading open-source deep learning frameworks continues to be led by U.S. technology enterprises\u2014e.g.,TensorFlow (Google) and PyTorch (Meta)\u2014Chinese alternatives developed by national champions such as PaddlePaddle (Baidu) and Mindspore (Huawei), among others, are growing in scope and importance within China. These developments illustrate that achieving self-sufficiency in open-source software development such as deep learning frameworks are on the political agenda of China\u2019s central government, feeding into its long-term desire for achieving digital sovereignty.\n\nCertain U.S. policies, such as placing a growing number of Chinese companies on the BIS Entity List, will make it more difficult for China\u2019s central government to rely on strategic technical components from the United States as part of the country\u2019s economic growth strategy, thus incentivizing China to continue toward its goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency. These developments mean that previous forms of cooperation across the Pacific, e.g., in terms of academic research and corporate R&D, are quietly diminishing. These developments may complicate the possibilities for finding new international solutions to harmonization of AI use and legislation.\n\nWhile the U.S. and EU diverge on AI regulation, focused on self-regulation versus comprehensive regulation of the digital space, respectively, they continue to share a fundamental approach to artificial intelligence based on respect for human rights. This approach is now slowly being operationalized to condemn the use of AI for social surveillance and control purposes, as witnessed in China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries. To some extent, \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cEuropean\u201d values are evolving into an ideological mechanism that aims to ensure a human rights-centered approach to the role and use of AI.45 Put differently, an alliance is currently forming around a human rights-oriented view of socio-technical governance, which is embraced and encouraged by like-minded democratic nations. This view strongly informs how public sector authorities should relate to and handle the use of AI and information technology in society.\n\nWhere are we headed?\nOn May 15, 2022, the United States and EU TTC held its second summit, this time in Saclay, a suburb of Paris and one of France\u2019s leading research and business clusters. Secretary Blinken and Vice President Vestager met again to promote transatlantic cooperation and democratic approaches to trade, technology, and security. The meeting ultimately strengthened the strategic relationship across the Atlantic in several specific areas, including engaging in more detailed information exchange on exports of critical technology to authoritarian regimes such as Russia. The United States and the EU will also engage in greater coordination of developing evaluation and measurement tools that contribute to credible AI, risk management, and privacy-enhancing technologies. A Strategic Standardization Information (SSI) mechanism will also be set up to enable greater exchange of information on international technology standards\u2014an area in which China is expanding its influence. In addition, an early warning system is being discussed to better predict and address potential disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain. This discussion includes developing a transatlantic approach to continued investment in long-term security in supply for the EU\/U.S. market.46\n\nWhile the TTC is slowly cementing the importance of the U.S. and the EU\u2019s democratic transatlantic alliance in artificial intelligence, the gap between the U.S. and China seems to widen. The world is, therefore, quietly moving away from a liberal orientation based on global interoperability, while technological development increasingly is entangled in competition between the governments of the United States and China. These developments diminish the prospects for finding international forms of cooperation on AI governance,47 and could contribute to a Balkanization of technological ecosystems. The result, already partially underway, would be the emergence of a \u201cChinese\u201d network and its digital ecosystem, a U.S. and a European one, each with its own rules and governing idiosyncrasies. In the long run, this may mean that it will be much more difficult to agree on how more complicated forms of artificial intelligence should be regulated and governed. At present, the EU and China do seem to agree on taking a more active approach to regulating AI and digital ecosystems relative to the U.S. This could change, however, if the U.S. were to pass the Algorithmic Accountability Act. Like the EU AI Act, the Algorithmic Accountability Act requires organizations to perform impact assessments of their AI systems before and after deployment, including providing more detailed descriptions on data, algorithmic behavior, and forms of oversight.\n\nShould the U.S. choose to adopt the Algorithmic Accountability Act, the regulatory approaches of the EU and the U.S. would be better aligned. Even though regulatory regimes may align over time, the current trajectory of digital fragmentation between the EU and US on one side, and China on the other, is set to continue under the current political climate.\n\nUndoubtedly, AI will continue to revolutionize society in the coming decades. However, it remains uncertain whether the world\u2019s countries can agree on how technology should be implemented for the greatest possible societal benefit. As stronger forms of AI continue to emerge across a wider range of use cases, securing AI alignment at the international level, could be one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Global supply chain disruptions following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the rapid rise in U.S. inflation over the past two years. Evidence suggests that supply chain pressures pushed up the cost of inputs for goods production and the public\u2019s expectations of higher future prices. These factors accounted for about 60% of the surge in U.S. inflation beginning in early 2021. Supply chain pressures began easing substantially in mid-2022, contributing to the slowdown in inflation.\n\nFollowing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, global shipping and transportation costs surged, and delivery times and backlogs spiked to historically high levels. The resulting supply shortages added significant pressure to inflation.\n\nThis Economic Letter examines the quantitative contribution of global supply chain disruptions to the run-up of U.S. inflation during the past two years. Our evidence suggests that an increase in supply chain pressures can lead to a sizable increase in overall personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation. Supply chain disruptions increase input costs and raise the public\u2019s expectations for higher prices. We estimate that these effects contributed about 60% of the above-trend run-up of headline inflation in 2021 and 2022.\n\nMeasuring global supply chain pressures\nWe measure supply chain disruptions using the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Akinci et al. 2022). The GSCPI summarizes information from 27 monthly indicators of transportation costs\u2014such as the Baltic Dry Index, the Harpex index, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics airfreight cost indexes\u2014and supply chain-related components from the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index surveys for manufacturing firms in seven major economies, including China, the euro area, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nFigure 1 shows the GSCPI (blue line) from January 1997 to April 2023. The GSCPI is normalized to have an average value of zero over the full time series. The vertical axis indicates how many standard deviations the index is above or below the average. As global supply conditions change, the GSCPI fluctuates around its average level. For example, the spike in 2011 reflects disruptions to automobile production and distribution following Japan\u2019s Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The index climbed again in 2017, following the China\u2013U.S. trade disputes. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the GSCPI jumped to unprecedented levels, over four standard deviations above its average value by the end of 2021. Since mid-2022, supply chain pressures have eased steadily, with the GSCPI gradually returning to its historical average.\n\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Pressure Index and PCE inflation\nSource: FRB New York, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and authors\u2019 calculations. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\n\nMovements in the GSCPI are modestly correlated with those in headline PCE inflation (green line), with a correlation of about 0.53 over the full sample. This correlation partly reflects the surges in both series during the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic sample (1997\u20132019), the correlation was much lower, about 0.24. In estimating the effects of changes in the GSCPI on inflation, we focus on the pre-pandemic sample period from 1998 to 2019, to ensure that our findings would not be driven by the special pandemic conditions.\n\nHow does inflation respond to supply chain shocks?\nThe correlation between inflation and the GSCPI reflects the combined effects of a variety of factors. To isolate the effects of changes in supply chain constraints on inflation, we first identify a GSCPI shock, which measures unexpected changes in the GSCPI that are not explained by fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions. In particular, our estimation controls for changes in aggregate demand conditions, measured by six-month lags of the unemployment gap, and in monetary policy, measured by two-year U.S. Treasury yields.\n\nWe use the local projections method\u2014a statistical tool proposed by Jord\u00e0 (2005)\u2014to project how inflation responds over time to a surprise increase in the GSCPI of one standard deviation above its average level. The size of this GSCPI shock is relatively modest compared with the sharp increase in the GSCPI during the pandemic.\n\nFigure 2 shows the average response of headline PCE inflation to a surprise GSCPI increase of one standard deviation relative to its average value (blue line). It also shows the confidence band (blue shading), indicating statistical uncertainty in estimating the responses. Assuming that the model is correctly specified, the shaded area contains the actual value of the inflation response to the GSCPI shock roughly two-thirds of the time.\n\nFigure 2\nResponses of headline PCE inflation to GSCPI shocks\n\nResponses of headline PCE inflation to GSCPI shocks\nNote: Blue shading indicates 68% confidence band.\n\nThe figure illustrates that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI leads to an increase in headline PCE inflation of about 0.5 percentage point at the peak. The effects are relatively short lived, statistically vanishing about a year after the impact.\n\nSince supply chain disruptions directly constrain supplies of traded goods, with only indirect effects on services, one would expect a GSCPI shock to boost goods price inflation more than overall inflation. This is the case in our model results. We find that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI raises PCE goods inflation by up to 1.5 percentage points relative to the pre-shock level, about three times the peak effect on overall inflation.\n\nWe also find that a GSCPI shock raises unemployment, suggesting that it acts like an adverse supply shock that raises inflation but reduces economic activity. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI raises the unemployment rate by up to 0.7 percentage point relative to the pre-shock level. These findings are in line with empirical studies of the effects of global supply chain disruptions on inflation and economic activity in the euro area (see, for example, Finck and Tillmann 2023).\n\nHow supply chain constraints can affect inflation\nA surprise increase in the GSCPI can raise inflation through several channels.\n\nThe first channel works through inflation expectations. Disruptions to global supply chains are often associated with surges in commodity prices. Studies have shown that people\u2019s inflation expectations\u2014especially for short-term, one-year ahead inflation\u2014are sensitive to commodity price fluctuations (see, for example, Glick et al. 2021). We examine the responses of one-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Philadelphia Fed\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) following surprise changes in the GSCPI. We find that a shock that raises the GSCPI one standard deviation increases SPF short-term inflation expectations by up to 0.1 percentage point. This estimate suggests that a shock that raises the GSCPI four standard deviations above its mean, as observed from late 2020 to late 2021, would increase one-year-ahead inflation expectations by up to 0.4 percentage point, or about 40% of the actual increase in the SPF short-term inflation expectations during the same period\u2014that is, from 2.1% in the first quarter of 2021 to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of a GSCPI shock on long-term SPF inflation expectations, such as for 10 years ahead, are more muted.\n\nThe second channel works through import prices. A tightening of supply chain constraints can raise imported goods prices, which are then passed through to consumer prices. Using a similar local projections model, we estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the GSCPI raises inflation for imported goods by up to 0.9 percentage point at the peak. However, since the share of imported goods makes up only about 5% of total PCE, the pass-through from the import price channel to final consumer price inflation is likely to be limited.\n\nThe third channel works through the costs of intermediate inputs. In response to supply chain disruptions, businesses would pass increases in intermediate input costs through to consumer prices. We use a similar local projections model to examine the quantitative importance of this channel. We find that a one standard deviation GSCPI shock raises 12-month changes in the producer price index (PPI) of crude materials by up to 10 percentage points. The same shock raises intermediate materials PPI inflation to a smaller extent, about 3.5 percentage points at the peak. The effects on finished goods PPI inflation are even smaller, about 2.5 percentage points. Thus, a GSCPI shock raises input prices significantly. However, as costs move further along the production chain, from initial inputs to intermediate goods, PPI inflation becomes less sensitive to a GSCPI shock. The effects of the shock on final consumer goods inflation are even more muted, as shown in Figure 1. This \u201csnake effect,\u201d whereby the impact of the shock dissipates as it works its way through the supply chain, is consistent with economic theory (see, for example, Huang and Liu 2001).\n\nContributions of GSCPI shocks to recent inflation\nTo assess the quantitative contributions of GSCPI shocks to the run-up of PCE inflation in the past two years, we use a structural vector-autoregression model that takes into account the joint dynamics between the GSCPI, inflation, and the control variables for demand conditions and monetary policy. We estimate the model using data from January 1998 to March 2023, and then compute the contributions of GSCPI shocks to the deviations of inflation from its sample average. This GSCPI-driven inflation is the predicted path of PCE inflation from our model, assuming that it has only been affected by shocks to the GSCPI.\n\nFigure 3 shows headline PCE inflation (gray line) separated into three components: trend inflation (green bars), contributions of the GSCPI (blue bars), and contributions of other factors (gold bars) from April 2021 to March 2023. During this period, GSCPI shocks contributed on average about 60% of the above-trend run-up of headline inflation. Our finding here is in line with recent analysis by Shapiro (2022), using a different methodology.\n\nFigure 3\nContributions of supply chain shocks to recent PCE inflation\n\nContributions of supply chain shocks to recent PCE inflation\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and authors\u2019 calculations.\n\nSince mid-2022, the contributions of GSCPI shocks have declined from 2.5 to 1.4 percentage points, and headline inflation has also slowed, reflecting the recent easing of supply chain constraints. Although the GSCPI fell back closer to its historical average around the beginning of this year (see Figure 1), the contribution of the GSCPI shock to inflation remains positive, reflecting the delayed effects of the shock on inflation.\n\nConclusion\nSupply shortages caused by global supply chain disruptions following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have added pressure on U.S. inflation. Our analysis suggests that supply chain shocks can have significant impacts on PCE inflation by raising inflation expectations and intermediate input costs. We estimate that supply chain disruptions contributed on average about 60% of the run-up of U.S. inflation during the past two years. Since mid-2022, indicators show that increased pressure from the supply chain disruptions have been easing gradually, which has contributed to the slowdown in inflation.\n\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues","supplychain"]}

SVB Financial's subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank, was shut down by regulatory agencies due to capital issues, sending shockwaves throughout the market.\n\nCould AAPL Be Impacted?\nDespite being headquartered in the same region as SVB Financial, there is no evidence that Apple has been impacted by the same issues that led to the shutdown of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nApple's solid balance sheet, with $54 billion in net cash, and the company\u2019s significant intangible value in the form of brand appreciation and customer loyalty positions the iPhone maker as a fortress in the market.\n\nBut at the same time, AAPL is the largest stock in the S&P 500, and its performance is largely correlated with the broad market index.

{"text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Congressional report published Thursday offered a blistering critique of popular Chinese retailers Shein and Temu, with lawmakers accusing the latter of failing to maintain \u201ceven the fa\u00e7ade of a meaningful compliance program\u201d that seeks to prevent goods made by forced labor from being sold on its platform.\n\nIn the report, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said Temu\u2019s business model essentially allows the company to avoid responsibility in complying with a U.S. law that block imports from China\u2019s Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers should know that there is an extremely high risk that Temu\u2019s supply chains are contaminated with forced labor,\u201d the report said.\n\nTemu is owned by Pinduoduo Inc., a popular e-commerce site in China. It was launched in the U.S. last year and has grown in popularity by offering cheap goods, from apparel to home products, from China-based sellers.\n\nThe report is part of an ongoing Congressional investigation into products offered to American consumers that could be made with forced labor in China. As part of the probe, the committee sent letters in early May to brands Nike and Adidas, as well as Shein and Temu asking for information about their compliance with the anti-forced labor law.\n\nLawmakers noted they weren\u2019t done with their investigation but wanted to quickly share some of their findings with the public.\n\nThe report said Temu admitted it \u201cdoes not expressly prohibit\u201d the sale of goods from Xinjiang and \u201cconducts no audits and reports no compliance system to affirmatively examine\u201d whether its suppliers are observing U.S. forced labor law. It also said the only deterring measure the company reported was making its suppliers agree to \u201cboilerplate terms and conditions\u201d that prohibit forced labor use.\n\nAccording to documents Temu provided to the committee, the company has more than 80,000 suppliers that fuel its vast e-commerce platform.\n\nThe report comes a few months after representatives with \u201cShut Down Shein,\u201d an anonymous coalition of brands and human rights organizations, began meeting with congressional offices seeking to increase scrutiny on the fast fashion site.\n\nLast week, two bipartisan bills were introduced in Congress seeking to make changes to a century-old trade rule - known as de minimis - that benefits both Shein and Temu.\n\nUnder the provision, imported packages valued under $800 receive tax exemptions and less oversight from U.S. customs. The report said Temu and Shein ship nearly all their packages, most of which are valued under $800, from China directly to consumers.

{"text":"Kazakhstan is the largest producer and exporter of uranium globally, mining and exporting more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s supply. Up to now, it has been the major supplier for Russia and before that the Soviet Union. But today, other countries are becoming involved, including Western countries such as the United States, which wants to limit its imports of Russian-processed uranium, and China, which hopes to transition from the coal-fired production of electricity to a heavy reliance on nuclear power plants over the next decade. That, in turn, has triggered a geo-economic competition that is rapidly growing into a geopolitical one\u2014given that, at least in the short term, Kazakhstan may not be able to increase exports to one country without reducing them to another, or at least holding the latter roughly constant.\n\nTwo decisions in Astana in May 2023 have both highlighted and exacerbated the situation, though they are likely to be dismissed by some as yet another example of Astana\u2019s efforts to maintain a balance between Moscow and Beijing. In the first decision, the Kazakhstani authorities allowed a Russian firm to take control of a uranium mine. Senior officials at Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan\u2019s atomic industry agency, were opposed; and several of them publicly resigned in the wake of that decision (Kaztag.kz, May 17). They had compelling reasons to do so: Once this mine is fully operational, Kazatomprom\u2019s control of the uranium industry in Kazakhstan will be reduced from its current 50-percent dominance and will ensure that Moscow can acquire at least some of the supplies it needs. Currently, Russia uses more than twice as many tons of uranium as its domestic mines produce, 5,500 tons against 2,500 for last year (World-nuclear.org, accessed May 31, [1]; [2]). That will also have the effect of bypassing Western sanctions at a time when the US is trying to tighten them (Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty, May 16).\n\nThe second, and likely more important reason given the length of time it will take before Russia can make the mine operational, involves Astana agreeing to sell Beijing more than 30 tons of atomic power station fuel over the coming decades to allow China to shift from coal to atomic power by the mid-2030s (Kazatomprom.kz, Kapital.kz, May 31). To meet this commitment, Kazakhstan has decided to increase its production of uranium and processed uranium components by more than 50 percent, a dramatic turnaround given its statement two years ago that it was cutting production by 10 percent to maintain prices given the declining demand for nuclear power plant fuel. Given that China is even more dependent than Russia on imported uranium\u2014Beijing produces little of its own\u2014this will link those two countries more tightly together in ways at least as important as the construction of new rail routes (EADaily.com, May 26).\n\nAt present, China and Russia remain the two largest purchasers of Kazakhstani uranium. However, their competition for this increasingly scarce resource is growing, and that is further complicated by the fact that Astana is exporting processed uranium to other countries as well, albeit in smaller amounts. Among these are Uzbekistan, Turkey, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Afghanistan (Zakon.kz, May 22). All are likely to be affected by the intensified competition between Russia and China for Kazakhstan\u2019s uranium.\n\nThese latest moves highlight three important realities about Central Asia and its relationship to outside actors that are often overlooked. First, China has interests in the region that are far larger than just building transportation routes to carry goods across and from Europe. Most, but not all, discussions not surprisingly focus on this. (See, for example, EDM, April 10, May 24.) Uranium is one of them, but it is hardly the only one. China also looks to Central Asia as a key market for Chinese-produced consumer goods and as a source of various minerals and, increasingly, water (Ritmeurasia.org, November 23, 2011; Cabar.asia, July 29, 2021).\n\nSecond, Beijing\u2019s interest in these additional factors will only add to the differences it has with Moscow on how to deal with the Central Asian countries. Indeed, the Kremlin may be more worried about Chinese involvement within these countries on behalf of its interests than it is by China\u2019s promotion of rail and highway routes bypassing Russia. The former will cement these countries far more closely to Beijing than the latter, which, after all, is directed not primarily at Central Asian markets but at European ones. Consequently, while Moscow may complain loudly about all the projects that seek to route goods \u201caround Russia\u201d rather than through it, Beijing\u2019s plans with Astana\u2019s uranium supplies will matter far more in tying countries of the region to China rather than to Russia\u2014all the more so due to Moscow\u2019s rapidly declining influence within these countries (see EDM, November 15, 2022).\n\nAnd third, the focus of outsiders on the resources of the Central Asian countries is a reminder of two things that seem to be forgotten even more often than the impact of Chinese interests and actions in the countries of the region. On the one hand, the Central Asian states have significant resources that make them critical to the world at-large. Kazakhstan is a superpower in terms of raw and processed uranium\u2014not just one of \u201cthe stans\u201d as some often treat it. And on the other, what happens in Central Asia as a result of these abundant resources will have a major impact on many countries, including those far away whose elites may not be fully aware of how these lines of influence work. For them, tensions over Kazakhstan\u2019s uranium and which countries will have access to it should be a wake-up call for them to pay closer attention to a region that, in recent years, has been all too often neglected.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"As Russian ground troops prepared to enter Ukraine in February 2021, Ukrainian governmental departments, online media organizations, financial firms, and hosting providers were slammed with a surge of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks only increased in frequency and impact as Russian tanks rolled across the border, adding to the frenzy and chaos of that time.\n\n\nQuick to hit back, Ukraine's IT Army sprang to life during the early days of the conflict. Much like Ukraine's volunteer army on the ground, recruits flooded in from all over the world to take part in the brewing war being waged online between Russia and Ukraine, with observed DDoS attacks focused on Russian targets increasing by 236% between February and March.\n\nWhat seems clear is that whether issued by hacktivists or nation-states, DDoS attacks are often the opening salvo between opposing forces in today\u2019s geopolitical conflicts. Compared with other types of cyberthreats, DDoS attacks can be launched relatively quickly. In addition, while DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption on their own, they can also mask or distract attention from more significant threats.\n\nAnd, as seen in Ukraine and elsewhere, the use of DDoS attacks on the digital battlefield seems to be increasing. This article will examine the history of DDoS attacks for geopolitical conflict compared with recent attacks, providing insights that organizations can use to protect themselves from collateral damage.\n\n\n2022: A Record-Setting Year for DDoS\nThe use of DDoS attacks to gain geopolitical advantage is nothing new, but the frequency at which these types of attacks are growing is noteworthy. In the latest \"DDoS Threat Intelligence Report,\" Netscout reported more than 6 million attacks in the first half of 2022. Of these attacks, a majority corresponded with national or regional conflicts.\n\nTo continue with the Ukraine example, the frequency of DDoS attacks directed at Ukraine leveled off by April 2022, while cyberattacks ratcheted up against perceived allies of Ukraine. This likely is attributable to Ukrainian Internet properties migrating to countries like Ireland, as instability in the intra-Ukraine Internet forced many network segments to rely upon connectivity in other countries.\n\nEchoes of this conflict continue to resonate across the global Internet. In March 2022, India experienced a measurable increase of DDoS attacks following its abstentions from United Nations Security Council and General Assembly votes condemning Russian actions in Ukraine. Similarly, during the first half of the year, Belize endured its single highest number of DDoS attacks on the same day that it made public statements in support of Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, the nation of Finland \u2014 a close neighbor of Russia \u2014 experienced a 258% percent year-over-year increase in DDoS attacks coinciding with its announcement to apply for membership in NATO. Poland, Romania, Lithuania, and Norway, meanwhile, all were targeted with DDoS attacks by adversaries linked to Killnet, a group of online attackers aligned with Russia.\n\nBut these examples rooted in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine are not the only online battlegrounds where fights over geopolitics are being waged. As tensions between Taiwan and China and Hong Kong and China escalated during the first half of the year, DDoS attack campaigns often coincided with public events. For example, in the run-up to Nancy Pelosi's historic visit to Taiwan this summer, the website of Taiwan's presidential office and other government websites went dark due to DDoS attacks. And in Latin America, during a contentious election in Colombia this past year, waves of successive DDoS attacks were launched during the initial vote and the contested runoff.\n\nOne common thread is that many of these attacks use known attack vectors and readily available DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booter\/stressor services, found on the Dark Web. These illicit services typically offer a restricted tier of free demonstration DDoS attacks to prospective customers, lowering the bar for would-be attackers to rapidly spin up attacks at very little to no cost. However, because these attack vectors are well-known, they can be easily mitigated in most circumstances.\n\nDon't Become Collateral Damage\nDDoS attacks have the potential to seriously disrupt Internet operations for their intended targets, but they can also cause a significant collateral impact footprint for bystander organizations and Internet traffic. This risk is particularly high as data hosting and services flow from war-torn regions like Ukraine to locations abroad.\n\nIn many of the examples listed above, the effectiveness of attacks largely depended upon whether targeted organizations had organized DDoS defenses. In Ukraine and other countries, disruption was quickly remedied for unprotected organizations as global DDoS defense companies stepped in to help Ukrainian organizations that needed it. However, ongoing defenses are still needed for most organizations.\n\nAmid this environment, the most prudent course of action to prevent collateral damage is to regularly assess DDoS risk factors, especially related to direct service delivery elements, supply chain partners, and other dependencies. Organizations should ensure that critical public-facing servers, services, applications, content, and supporting infrastructure are adequately protected. They also should check to make sure DDoS defense plans reflect ideal current configurations and operational conditions, and that the plans are periodically tested to verify that they can be successfully implemented as required.\n\nIn summary, events during the last year have proven that DDoS attacks \u2014 whether launched by nation-states, ideological groups, or rogue individuals \u2014 will not diminish any time soon. DDoS remains an effective tool for disrupting networks and degrading the morale of countries embroiled in sociopolitical upheaval, with new attacks happening every day. To stay protected in this time of war and geopolitical conflict, organizations must remain vigilant in their defense.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"NEW YORK \u2014 Ben & Jerry\u2019s has been hit with a class action lawsuit and charges of hypocrisy for the use of child labor in its supply chain, despite the ice cream maker\u2019s declared commitment to social justice causes, an image it holds up as a key part of its branding.\n\nThe company\u2019s involvement with child labor came to light shortly after it settled a high-profile legal battle with its parent firm over an attempted boycott against Israel, which Israel supporters viewed as prejudiced. The Ben & Jerry\u2019s board responsible for the boycott has stayed mum about the labor issue, while its leader has continued to take shots at Israel.\n\nThe Vermont-based company claimed in recent filings that it did not use child labor in its supply chain and has avoided divulging when it found out about the matter.\n\nThe labor issue surfaced publicly in a New York Times investigation late last month. The report revealed that American corporations and their suppliers use underage migrant laborers for dangerous and grueling factory jobs, including in dairy facilities that supply Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\n\nMany of the children fled destitution in Central America, arrived in the US as unaccompanied minors, and were then exploited for labor. They work to pay off debts to smugglers, send cash to their families back home, and pay for living costs. The jobs keep many of them out of school. The US Department of Labor said it would take action to rein in illegal child migrant labor in response to the report.\nThe injury rate for dairy facilities is twice the national average compared to all industries, said the report, which included testimony from a boy who crushed his hand in an industrial milking machine in Vermont.\n\nThe state\u2019s labor laws allow anyone over 16 to do any work in agriculture, and bar those under that age from doing any hazardous jobs. There is no evidence that Ben & Jerry\u2019s, or its suppliers, violated labor laws.\n\n\nIllustrative: A worker watches the milking operation at a farm in Fairfield, Vermont, March 5, 2009. (AP Photo\/ Toby Talbot, File)\nA Ben & Jerry\u2019s representative appeared to acknowledge the issue to the New York Times, saying the company cooperated with labor groups to monitor working conditions at its suppliers and claiming that if migrant children needed to work full time, it was better for them to work at a well-monitored workplace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response to the report, a plaintiff filed a federal class action lawsuit against Ben & Jerry\u2019s in a New York court, claiming the company had misrepresented its ethical commitments to consumers.\n\nThe case argues that Ben & Jerry\u2019s charges a premium for its products, partly based on its image as a socially conscious company, and that consumers would not have bought from the company, or paid as much, if they had been aware of its suppliers\u2019 use of child labor. The plaintiff, Dovid Tyrnauer, sought damages and other commitments from Ben & Jerry\u2019s for breach of trust.\n\nDuring the legal proceedings involving the company\u2019s attempted boycott, Ben & Jerry\u2019s repeatedly argued, including in the same New York court where the class action lawsuit was filed, that its conscientious image was a core part of its business strategy and financial success.\n\n\u201cWhile Ben & Jerry\u2019s purports to use ethical supply chains and professes concern about farmworker welfare, the reality could not be further from the truth. Migrant child labor is used in Ben & Jerry\u2019s supply chains,\u201d the lawsuit claimed. \u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s wishes to have its ice cream and eat it too. It wishes to sell premium priced products with pompous virtue-signaling representations regarding its supposedly ethical sourcing, all the while migrant child labor is used in its supply chains. Put simply, this is a case about greed run amok.\u201d\n\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s ice cream on sale at a shop in Jerusalem, on July 19, 2021. (Yonatan Sindel\/ Flash90)\n\u201cThe premiums that consumers pay for allegedly ethically-sourced products, in this instance, are not justified and constitute a breach of consumer trust through the misrepresentations,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawyers for the plaintiff did not respond to a request for comment, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s did not yet have legal representation listed in the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the New York Times report, Ben & Jerry\u2019s issued a statement opposing child labor and highlighting the company\u2019s ethical commitments and ties with workers\u2019 rights groups. The statement did not deny the use of child labor by the company\u2019s suppliers, or that Ben & Jerry\u2019s was aware of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by the claims made in this story, and do not tolerate any suppliers who are not adhering to the law. Let us be extremely clear: Ben & Jerry\u2019s stands in strong opposition to child labor,\u201d the statement said.\n\nContacted for comment about the class action lawsuit, Ben & Jerry\u2019s referred The Times of Israel to the previous statement, and did not answer specific questions, including about when the company became aware of child workers in its supply chain.\n\n\nImmigrant farm workers sign an agreement with Ben & Jerry\u2019s to promote workers rights in Burlington, Vermont, October 3, 2017. (AP Photo\/Wilson Ring)\nThe company\u2019s prior knowledge of the issue is significant because it certified in filings submitted in January that its suppliers did not use child labor. The disclosure was for the company\u2019s registration as a B Corporation, a private certification that verifies a company\u2019s \u201chigh standards of social and environmental performance.\u201d Ben & Jerry\u2019s also said in 2017 filings that its employee handbook barred the use of child labor.\n\nThe Ben & Jerry\u2019s independent board tasked with protecting the company\u2019s \u201csocial mission,\u201d which decided to boycott Israeli settlements, has not commented on the child labor issue. A company spokesperson said the statement responding to the New York Times investigation was not attributable to the board.\n\nThe board\u2019s chair, Anuradha Mittal, has not publicly commented, but has repeatedly shared anti-Israel content on Twitter since the child labor issue came to light. Mittal has a pro-intifada poster on her office wall.\n\n\nIllustrative: Cows on a farm in Sudbury, Vermont, August 8, 2022. (AP Photo\/Steven Senne)\nAlyza Lewin, a lawyer for Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel in its lawsuit against the boycott, said the child labor allegations had exposed the company\u2019s double-standard when it comes to Israel.\n\n\u201cThis information that\u2019s now come out about the immigrant child workers does kind of confirm the hypocrisy of the whole episode with Israel,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cWhat you had was a board that caved to BDS pressure and it was never about trying to help Palestinians.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go out there and claim that you\u2019re all about social justice, then where is your voice now when it comes to these poor children?\u201d Lewin said.\n\nThe head of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel, Avi Zinger, who waged a successful legal battle against the boycott, has said the move hurt Palestinians, including employees, consumers, and his West Bank business partner.\n\nThe Ben & Jerry\u2019s board announced its decision to boycott \u201coccupied Palestinian territory\u201d in July 2021, following Israel\u2019s war that year with Gaza-based terrorists and after a heavy social media campaign against the company. Israeli laws bar discrimination against citizens based on where they live, meaning a boycott of settlements would amount to a ban on selling anywhere in Israel.\n\n\nPro-Israel demonstrators protest against Ben and Jerry\u2019s over its boycott of the West Bank, and against antisemitism, in New York City, on August 12, 2021. (Luke Tress\/Flash90)\nThe decision set off a convoluted legal battle and heavy repercussions for Unilever, the Ben & Jerry\u2019s parent company, as US states enacted anti-BDS divestment laws, pulling hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from the UK conglomerate.\n\nThe ice cream maker\u2019s decision to boycott \u201coccupied territory\u201d sparked uproar in Israel and among some US Jewish groups. Critics of the boycott argued it was antisemitic because the company has never attempted to boycott any other region of the world.\n\nSupporters of the boycott Israel movement say that in urging businesses, artists, and universities to sever ties with Israel, they are using nonviolent means to oppose unjust policies toward Palestinians. Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize and destroy the Jewish state.\n\nZinger and Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel refused to comply with the settlement boycott, arguing it was illegal under Israeli and US law. Their license to sell the ice cream was only set to expire at the end of 2022, meaning the boycott never went into effect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nWorkers at the Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel factory near Kiryat Malakhi, July 21, 2021. (Flash90\/File)\nBen & Jerry\u2019s Israel sued Unilever over the dispute in the US, claiming Unilever unlawfully terminated their business contract. Months later, Unilever settled with Ben & Jerry\u2019s Israel, granting the Israeli branch independence to sell its products indefinitely in Israel and the West Bank, using Hebrew and Arabic branding. Under the agreement, Ben & Jerry\u2019s has no authority over the Israeli franchise.\n\nUnilever has said the board had announced the settlement boycott without consulting with the parent company.\n\nShortly after that agreement was announced, Ben & Jerry\u2019s sought to block the deal by suing Conopco, the main US branch of Unilever, arguing that Unilever had breached its acquisition deal with Ben & Jerry\u2019s. The unusual 2000 merger agreement gave the ice cream maker\u2019s board the authority to protect the company\u2019s \u201csocial mission.\u201d The lawsuit marked an unprecedented legal dispute between a major company and its parent corporation.\n\nUnilever said it had resolved its dispute with Ben & Jerry\u2019s in December without specifying the terms of the agreement. The case had appeared to be going against Ben & Jerry\u2019s before the deal was announced.\n\nZinger said he was \u201cpleased\u201d the litigation had been resolved, and Ben & Jerry\u2019s and its board did not comment.\n\nThe Jewish founders of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, who no longer run the company, have said Unilever \u201cusurped their authority\u201d by spinning off the Israel branch.\n\nThe case has illustrated the pitfalls of progressive corporate activism, the risks for companies attempting to boycott Israel and the growing role of corporate investing in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute in the US.","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"Change is afoot in the semiconductor industry. The Biden administration has provided new funding amid concerns that the U.S. has become too dependent on microchips made abroad. Tensions are also rising between China and Taiwan, where most chips are made. Will this lead to supply chain problems?\n\nIntel is hoping to even the playing field by building new factories in Arizona, Ohio, and Germany. Specifically, the company is planning to invest at least $20 billion in two new factories in Ohio.\n\nDavid Zinsner, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel, said that the stakes are high: Intel has a global presence and is not immune from intense geopolitical challenges.\n\n\u201cWhere Intel is complex is in these kind of more geopolitical challenges. There are a lot of things that are very single-threaded and can just completely bankrupt a company if decisions aren\u2019t made correctly,\u201d Zinsner said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s where the pressure, I think, is a little bit higher [for us].\u201d\n\nAt the most recent MIT Sloan CFO Summit, finance professorMatthew Rhodes-Kropfspoke with Zinsner about these tough geopolitical challenges as well as intellectual property and creative financing. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\nNavigating geopolitical challenges\nThe U.S. currently accounts for only about 12% of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Many worry that in the event of an escalated conflict between Taiwan and China, semiconductor supply chains may be disrupted, which is why U.S. chipmakers are ramping up their operations stateside.\n\nZinsner said that if Intel emerges as a robust supplier, it could help reduce the tension between China and Taiwan.\n\n\u201cBecause we are creating this U.S.-European supply for semiconductors, in a way I feel like we are lowering the geopolitical tensions that are out there,\u201d Zinsner said. \u201cBecause Taiwan is so important to the world, it becomes this lightning rod for China and the U.S., but if there is a more balanced supply chain, it becomes less \u2026 volatile.\u201d\n\nGetting creative with financing\n\nIn addition building plants in Arizona, Ohio, and Germany, Intel is expanding in Israel and Ireland. The Arizona project \u2014 which is projected to cost $30 billion \u2014 is \u201cnot something that even Intel can do on its own, so we\u2019ve had to lean on government support,\u201d Zinsner said.\n\nThe CHIPS Act should help. Passed by Congress last year to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing, design, and research, the act provides around $52 billion in new funding for U.S. manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\nAdditionally, Intel has partnered with infrastructure investment firm Brookfield on some \u201ccreative financing,\u201d Zinsner said: Brookfield will jointly invest in the fabrication plant in Arizona such that \u201cas the fab starts to generate cash flow, which doesn\u2019t happen for four or five years, then we share in the cash flow.\u201d\n\nIntel \u201cgives up a little bit of the upside in the outer years,\u201d Zinsner said, \u201cbut it gives us $15 billion to work with, which is obviously pretty helpful in terms of financing.\u201d\n\nProtecting intellectual property\nAmid concerns that China is infringing on U.S. intellectual property, the U.S. government has issued regulations that will prohibit China from advancing in the semiconductor race. The rules aim to stop U.S. and non-U.S. companies from supplying Chinese entities with hardware or software comprising American technology in its supply chain.\n\nZinsner acknowledged this friction and said that while China is a \u201cmeaningful\u201d market for Intel, it\u2019s still important to protect U.S. intellectual property, calling this trade-off \u201ca balancing act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key is to make sure that we are supporting [Chinese] customers, but also staying true to the rules that the U.S. puts in place to protect very advanced technology from getting into those markets,\u201d Zinsner said.\n\n\u201cI do think that semiconductor companies generate a lot of income from selling globally, and all that global cash flow comes back into R&D investments that end up helping the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it has to be a very careful approach \u2014 how to protect IP in a way that makes sure that all companies remain healthy in the process.\u201d","labels":["investments"]}
{"text":"The Ebola outbreak created a demand for personal protective equipment. Clinics can go through hundreds of PPE suits a day. Manufacturers increased production but agencies say there's still a shortage.\n\nWe're hearing a lot in today's program about the people who care for patients with Ebola. There is a shortage of suits to protect them.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nHealth care workers are supposed to wear personal protective equipment, or PPEs. They cover every part of the body, from the hood and goggles, to gloves and coveralls, down to the boots.\n\nINSKEEP: PPEs are in short supply because clinics in West Africa can go through hundreds in a single day. NPR's Jackie Northam reports.\n\nJACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: For one month earlier this fall, Dr. Massoud Javadi spent many hours of the day wearing head-to-toe protective gear, or PPE. The Houston doctor was in Foya, a small town in northern Liberia. He worked at a clinic set up by Doctors Without Borders. Javadi was surrounded by more than a hundred Ebola patients, but he says he wasn't worried.\n\nMASSOUD JAVADI: When you're in the isolation unit in your PPE outfit, that's pretty much the safest place to be. You're surrounded by people, but you have maximum protection on.\n\nNORTHAM: You can buy a full protective outfit for as cheap as $15 online. But Doctors Without Borders uses a higher-quality PPE, costing about $75 apiece. Javadi says they are thick and unwieldy and particularly tough in the extreme heat.\n\nJAVADI: After about 30 or 40 minutes, your goggles have fogged up; your socks are completely drenched in sweat. You're just walking in water in your boots. And at that point, you have to exit for your own safety.\n\nNORTHAM: Javadi says many people - doctors, nurses, people recovering the dead - wear the PPEs and that his clinic occasionally ran low on stocks. More had to be brought in from other centers. He says the apron and boots can be disinfected and reused. Everything else must be destroyed.\n\nJAVADI: The gloves and the gowns and the masks, those are all disposable and must be burned. And we go through a lot of them, boxes and boxes every day.\n\nNORTHAM: Doctors Without borders says it has about 25,000 protective clothing kits in each of its half-a-dozen clinics spread across Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - about a two-month supply. But the Centers for Disease Control says the number of Ebola victims is increasing exponentially and could reach tens of thousands by the end of the year. That's created a surge in demand for the PPEs. Dupont, a major manufacturer, says it has recently tripled its production. Kimberly-Clark has also increased production, says Judson Boothe, the company's senior product supply director.\n\nJUDSON BOOTHE: We've had ministries. We've also had non-government organizations that are trying to get product all the way down to communities and then certainly the health care networks within those regions are trying to respond and fill out their stockpiles as well.\n\nNORTHAM: The United Nations say the World Health Organization plans to send about 400,000 PPEs to West Africa and that 3M is also working on a plan to provide up to half-a-million a month. The Japanese government will donate another half-a-million from its stockpiles. But aid agencies such as UNICEF and AmeriCares says that the current ongoing demand isn't being met. Boothe maintains there are enough PPEs available, but getting them to the agencies is challenging. He says part of the problem is a complicated ineffective supply chain involving too many distributors and intermediaries.\n\nBOOTHE: Sometimes, you do get speculators that try to turn this into a profit exercise where they have investors, and they try to buy up a lot of stuff. And then they try to sell it at the highest price to the highest bidder. And then also, some of it is just dealing with distributors who are dealing with even other layers of distributors. And these products are passing hands three and four times.\n\nNORTHAM: Boothe says it would be more efficient if all the agencies coordinated through one large entity such as the World Health Organization. Michael Rettig is the executive director of LIFT, a disaster logistics company which is shuttling supplies into Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. He says there were reports of the PPEs not making it to the clinics in West Africa because of what he calls shrinkage.\n\nMICHAEL RETTIG: We know that there were some shipments that went into Liberia and within a few days ended up on the black market.\n\nNORTHAM: Rettig says his company has set up a system to prevent such theft. But he says another headache is logistics. Most of the PPEs will go through Monrovia. He says the airport there only has the capacity to unload two, maybe three, aircraft a day, which could be a challenge when more cargo starts arriving.

Since the eruption has eased, the fissure has shrunk to about 250 feet long, according to the NASA Earth Observatory.\n\nThe tornado likely formed as a result of the hot lava spewing from the fissure, heating the air directly above it, causing the air to rise and spin upwards in a spiral.\n\nvolcano tornado iceland\nThe tornado near to the lava flow.

Company leaders detailed its current limitations and long-term expansion plans during multiple sessions at Amazon Accelerate.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the conference about Supply Chain by Amazon, what it offers now and what it could offer in the near future.\n\nAccess now \u2794\n\nTrendline\n\nProcurement strategies in today's supply chain\n\nCan relationships between buyers and suppliers evolve fast enough to keep up with the speed of ever-changing supply chain risks?\n\nAccess now \u2794\n\nTrendline\n\nProcurement strategies in today's supply chain\n\nCan relationships between buyers and suppliers evolve fast enough to keep up with the speed of ever-changing supply chain risks?\n\nThere are some limitations \u2014 for now\n\nAlthough some services within Supply Chain by Amazon can be used beyond the U.S., Supply Chain by Amazon in its entirety is U.S. only, said Dhananjay Ramaswamy, director of product management for global shipping at Amazon.\n\n\u201cWe are working on building the network and perfecting it, but we will of course be looking at other destinations in the near future,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\nCertain product categories are not yet supported by Supply Chain by Amazon, including perishables, items that contain potentially dangerous substances or materials and bulky, \u201cnon-sortable\u201d goods that can't be stored in boxes, said David Barashi , an executive for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution, its long-term storage service that's part of Supply Chain by Amazon. Those products can still be placed directly into Fulfillment by Amazon, the company's fulfillment offering for sellers, however.\n\nAmazon is working to make more of these products eligible for its end-to-end offering.\n\nAmazon is touting its ocean shipping reliability\n\nAmazon Global Logistics, part of the company's end-to-end supply chain offering, handles cross-border transportation for sellers.\n\nYear-to-date, 84% of Amazon Global Shipping's shipments have arrived at or before the promised arrival date at the time of booking, according to Hernan Zini, director of logistics services at Amazon Global Logistics.\n\n\u201cWe can partner with carriers that have a very good reliability and very good speed on ocean freight,\u201d Zini said.\n\nThis gives sellers an added incentive to use Supply Chain by Amazon, rather than leaning on a separate company to bring products into the Amazon's fulfillment network, Ramaswamy said.\n\nAccess now \u2794\n\nTrendline\n\nNavigating supply chain peak season in 2022\n\nNavigating and managing peak season each year comes with unique challenges.

Why would you want to walk away from the ability to integrate the entire supply chain and get the benefit all the way from the origin end to end?\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\nMore origin points beyond China will be added\n\nAmazon Global Logistics currently allows sellers to ship cargo from mainland China and Hong Kong to Amazon facilities in the U.S., UK and EU.\n\n\u201cThere was a reason for that,\u201d Zini said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we get it right before we start scaling and spreading our products across the globe.\u201d\n\nNext year, sellers can expect an announcement from Amazon on new countries of origin to ship cargo from, Zini said. Vietnam has been a frequent request and will likely be an addition for Amazon Global Logistics in the near future, he added.\n\nAmazon is encouraging shipments into East Coast ports\n\nAmazon Global Logistics is offering sellers lower prices to ship their products from China to the U.S. East Coast, rather than to the West Coast, Zini said. While ocean freight transit times typically take 7 to 10 days longer to get to New York instead of Los Angeles, it's worth it to quickly meet East Coast consumer demand, he added.\n\n\u201cOnce the container arrives there, we can move it very fast into the fulfillment centers on the East Coast so you are regionally, or locally, in stock,\u201d Zini said.\n\nZini also highlighted risks regarding congestion at West Coast ports, which was a frequent problem when imports surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think it's particularly important to diversify, and having goods coming into both sides of the country could be a good way for you to manage any risk,\u201d he said.\n\nKeep up with the story.

This is because while Fulfillment by Amazon focuses on getting orders to customers quickly, Amazon Warehousing and Distribution provides long-term storage for bulk inventory.\n\nThe service, now open to all sellers, won't have increased storage fees during peak season. This will allow sellers to store plenty of inventory at a reduced cost as they prepare for the holiday ordering rush, Ramaswamy said.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is piloting whether sellers can reserve storage space guaranteeing them access to long-term capacity months in advance, said Barashi, the Amazon Warehousing and Distribution executive.\n\n\u201cWe continue to invest in [Amazon Warehousing and Distribution], and we are planning to add significantly more capacity in the next 12 months to make sure we meet all your needs,\u201d Barashi said.\n\nid:215637_6410\n\nWorkers pack and ship customer orders at an Amazon fulfillment center on Aug. 1, 2017 in Romeoville, Illinois.

{"text":"Take good care of your air conditioner, everyone. In a summer of record temperatures, Florida is in for more brutal heat this week with highs in the 90s and dangerously hot conditions with \"feels like\" heat indices well into triple digits across the state, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nAn excessive heat warning with heat index values up to 115 degrees is in effect across north and South Florida and Southeast Georgia from 10 a.m. EDT Tuesday until 8 p.m.\n\nAn excessive heat watch advisory has been issued for Wednesday across North Florida, with heat index values up to 113 possible.\n\nCentral Florida is under a heat advisory from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., with heat index values up to 112 expected.\n\n\nBe sure to take precautions. The danger from rising temperatures is getting worse. An average of 700 people died every year in the U.S. between 2004 and 2018 of heat-related causes, according to the CDC, and 3,066 heat-related deaths occurred during 2018-2020. According to data from the National Conference of Citizenship, heat-related deaths in Florida have increased 88% in the last three years.\n\nStay in air-conditioned spaces as much as possible, the NWS advises. Stay hydrated, and wear sunscreen and protective clothing.\n\n\nWhat is an excessive heat warning?\nNationwide, the NWS issues an Excessive Heat Warning when heat index values, the \"feels like\" temperatures, are expected to be 105-110 degrees or higher for at least two consecutive days and nighttime air temperatures will not drop below 75 degrees, depending on the local climate.\n\nDifferent areas of Florida have different criteria for issuing excessive heat warnings, such as a heat index forecast of 113 degrees or higher for at least two hours.\n\n\nA heat index of 103 to 124 degrees can cause heat cramps and heat exhaustion, the NWS said, and possible heat stroke with prolonged exposure and\/or physical activity. Heat stroke is extremely likely with heat indices over 125 degrees. If you don't take precautions immediately when conditions are extreme, you may become seriously ill or even die.\n\nOn June 1, the Miami-Dade NWS began using new heat advisory criteria for that area that lowered the range of heat indices required to more closely reflect the \"significant health impacts from heat\" that occur at lower heat index values. In that county only, excessive heat warnings are issued when the heat index reaches 110 degrees or higher for at least two hours. If this is evaluated to be more accurate, the new criteria will be rolled out to the rest of South Florida in 2024.\n\nStay cool (or less hot):As temperatures hit 'dangerously hot conditions' in Florida, here is everything to know to stay safe\n\nIf you can't stand the heat...8 tips to stay cool in the kitchen during a Florida heat wave\n\nWhat is an excessive heat watch?\nHeat index chart.\nThe NWS issues an Excessive Heat Watch when an excessive heat event is likely in the next 24 to 72 hours. Excessive heat watches are used when the timing of the heat event isn't nailed down yet.\n\nWhat is a heat advisory?\nThe NWS issues a Heat Advisory within 12 hours of the onset of dangerous heat conditions when the heat index is expected to reach 100 degrees or higher for at least two consecutive days and nighttime air temperatures will not drop below 75 degrees, depending on local climate.\n\nWhat watches and warnings have been issued in Florida?\n\nWhat is the heat index?\n\n\"It's not the heat, it's the humidity,\" as people in Florida are a little too fond of saying. For the heat index, it's both.\n\nWhile the temperature tells you how hot it is, the heat index combines the temperature and humidity levels to tell you what the temperature actually feels like outside. Weather apps and forecasters call it the \"real feel\" or \"feels like\" temperature, and it's important to know.\n\n\nWhen your body gets too hot, it cools itself off by sweating and your body's temperature reduces as the perspiration evaporates. When the relative humidity is high (that's the moisture in the atmosphere), your sweat doesn't evaporate as quickly (or at all) and you feel warmer. When humidity levels are low, your perspiration evaporates more quickly and the \"feels like\" temperature might feel even cooler than the Fahrenheit number.\n\n\"For example, if the air temperature is 100 degrees and the relative humidity is 15%,\" the National Weather Service explains on their website, \"the heat index is 96 degrees.\"\n\nKeep in mind, the heat index value is for shady locations. \"If you are exposed to direct sunlight, the heat index value can be increased by up to 15 degrees,\" the NWS said.  \n\nWhat is the difference between the heat index and the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature?\nThe Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is similar to the heat index in that it measures more than just the temperature to give you a sense of what the weather really feels like. But the WBGT measures temps in the sun, not the shade, and includes wind, cloud cover and the angle of the sun to help indicate heat stress for active populations such as outdoor workers and athletes.\n","labels":["natural_disasters"]}
{"text":"Goldman Sachs just upped the ante on the remote work reckoning.\n\nThe company is asking workers to come back to the office five days a week, according to a Bloomberg report. This is a much stricter policy than many other corporations, who have asked employees to return for at least two to three days a week.\n\nAnd Goldman's move to raise the stakes on RTO could spur others to do the same.\n\n\"It's time to face reality. We're getting back to five days a week, because that's the reality. That's what we saw before COVID and that's what we're currently seeing,\" said Jason Greer, the founder and president of Greer Consulting, on CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\"Companies are coming from the perspective of this\u2026 If I pay you every two weeks to come into the office, you come into the office and if you don't like it, take your ball and go somewhere else because there are thousands of employees looking to get your position,\" Greer said.\n\nGreer said that companies are in a much different place than they were two years ago when they were offering employees more incentives, greater pay, and struggling to hire. There are more potential employees on the market, and quite simply, they have more leverage. So they are increasingly asking employees to come back to the office full time, even if it means they lose some workers.\n\n\"I hear this from executives all the time: 'We understand that we put these mandates in place, we're going to lose some people, but the good thing is there's so much available talent in the market, that if we lose those folks, we can replace them with people \u2014 and we can replace them with people who will actually command less than what those people were leaving out the door are commanding,'\" Greer said.\n\nGreer said that there were a lot of employers who paid workers $50,000 to $100,000 more than what they wanted to during the pandemic labor shortage. But now, with layoffs across industries, especially in tech, employers have more power. Many companies have also realized they can maintain productivity with fewer people.\n\nAmazon, Meta, and other major companies are also putting more pressure on employees to return to the office. Meta is asking most employees to return at least three days a week after September 5 or they could potentially lose their jobs.\n\nAmazon is asking remote employees to return to the company's nearest \"hub,\" which is a location assigned to them, or find work elsewhere. Even Zoom, the company that powered the remote work revolution during the COVID Era, is asking employees who work within 50 miles of its offices to return at least two days a week.\n\nGreer said that employers are asking people back because there are connections you simply cannot make in a remote environment where people are operating virtually.\n\n\"In order to build a culture, you need to be face-to-face,\" he said. \"Your manager needs to get to know you, you need to get to know your manager, you need to get to know your coworkers. And we can only do that to an extent virtually.\"\n\nIn short, the writing is on the wall.\n\n\"The days of COVID where we are able to work remotely, they're gone,\" Greer said.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

Following escalating violence in Sudan, one of the world\u2019s major gum arabic suppliers, FMCG manufacturers face yet another supply chain crisis, according to a report published by Reuters.\n\nTHE DETAILS Sudan produces some 70 to 80 percent of world\u2019s gum arabic, a key ingredient in soft drinks and used in cosmetics too. Manufacturers who rely on the ingredient, such as Coca Cola, have some three to six months stockpiled, Reuters reports.\n\nTHE WHY?

{"text":"Aug 31 (Reuters) - India's economy grew at its fastest pace in a year in the June quarter, supported by strong services activity and robust demand, data released by the government showed on Thursday.\n\nGross domestic product expanded 7.8% on an annual basis in the April to June quarter, accelerating from the 6.1% growth recorded in the March quarter and topping a 7.7% forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nIt was also the highest reading since the equivalent period of 2022, when growth stood at 13.1%.\n\nCOMMENTARY:\n\nRADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE\n\"The economy's growth at 7.8% in 1QFY24 was amongst the fastest versus its regional peers, benefitting by a sharp jump in the government capex expenditure, firm services momentum and better consumption, besides a favourable base. External trade was in a soft spot, reflecting the impact of weak global forces. A strong growth print provides the room for the RBI to be focused on anchoring inflationary expectations.\"\n\nVIVEK KUMAR, ECONOMIST, QUANTECO RESEARCH, MUMBAI\n\"Acceleration in India's GDP growth to 7.8% Y\/Y in Q1FY24 is along expected lines. This was single-handedly driven by recovery in private consumption, even as other demand side drivers showed moderation. Meanwhile, reflecting slowdown in global trade, exports contracted on annualized basis for the first time in 10 quarters.\n\n\"On the supply side, services continue to outpace industry performance with strong traction in contact-intensive activities along with finance and real estate services.\"\n\n\"While this is comforting, we do believe Q1 would mark the peak in near term growth trajectory, with successive quarterly numbers printing lower. We maintain our FY24 GDP growth to moderate to 6.0% (with a mild upside risk) from 7.2% in FY23 on account of lagged impact of past monetary tightening, adverse spillover from global slowdown, uncertainty related to monsoon performance, and waning of pent-up demand.\"\n\nMADHAVI ARORA, LEAD ECONOMIST, EMKAY GLOBAL, MUMBAI\n\"While the April-June quarter growth print is in line with our expectations, the growth mix was a bit of a surprise. Ideally, the Y\/Y fall in commodity prices should have boosted manufacturing firms' operating profits and thereby lifted the value-added-growth of manufacturing sector. Thus, the disappointment on that front was surprising.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, strong government capex and credit growth expectedly led to double-digit construction sector growth and financial services growth respectively. While we retain our FY24E GDP growth at sub 6%, we recognise economic activity recovery is not yet broad-based.\"\n\nSAKSHI GUPTA, PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK, GURUGRAM\n\"GDP growth was in line with our expectations, growing at 7.8% in Q1. Within major sectors, services continued to drive overall growth, although there seem to be some signs now that contact-intensive services \u2014 that were a major support so far \u2014 are beginning to moderate.\"\n\n\"Manufacturing growth at 4.7% was broadly in line with the trend seen in high-frequency indicators and lower input costs continue to benefit corporate profitability. Going forward, risks to growth have increased, both from weather-related disturbances and as external headwinds \u2014 in terms of slower growth \u2014 remain high.\"\n\nDEVENDRA KUMAR PANT, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INDIA RATINGS &amp; RESEARCH, GURUGRAM\n\"1QFY24 GDP growth was on expected lines. Important trends \u2013 PFCE growth at 6% (a three-quarter-high) on a high base of 19.8% growth in 1QFY23, 8% GFCF growth on a high base of 20.4% in 1QFY23, and strong services growth. First-quarter agriculture gross value added (GVA) is dependent on the previous fiscal's agriculture performance. The pressure point is likely to emerge from agriculture and continued weakness in exports. However, the strong services growth momentum is likely to strongly support GDP growth in FY24.\"\n\nSACHCHIDANAND SHUKLA, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO, MUMBAI\n\"Q1 GDP numbers (are) broadly in line with expectations, with a confirmation of weakness on the consumption side and with El Nino impact yet to reflect on agri\/rural and discretionary consumption. But importantly, while from a year-on-year perspective this seems a peak for GDP numbers, from an absolute output perspective the numbers will actually be going up each subsequent quarter for the remainder of FY24.\"\n\nSUJAN HAJRA, CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ANAND RATHI SHARES AND STOCK BROKERS, MUMBAI\n\"India's GDP growth in Q1FY24 at 7.8% was a tad below our expectations of 8%. This once again makes India the fastest growing major economy, a position the country is likely to maintain for several years. Yet, we do not expect this pace to continue for the rest of the year and see the yearly growth at 6.2%. But that, too, is very good performance against the current global backdrop.\"\n\n\"We expect consumption to remain resilient and net exports to improve during the year but still remain a drag. We expect slowdown in investment. But this is likely to recover in FY25. With strong growth and elevated inflation, the RBI would be hard-pressed to tighten monetary policies. If retail inflation does remain high in August, we would expect a symbolic rate hike.\"\n\nGARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST, INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI\n\"Economic activity in Q1 FY24 at 7.8% was boosted by a continued uptick in urban centric services demand, and improved investment activity, led mainly by government. We see FY24 GDP growth at 6.2-6.3%.\n\nIn the near term, the following factors are likely to appear as key risks to India's growth:\n\n1) Uneven rainfall and weak August rains are likely to impact kharif yield and rabi sowing, thereby impacting rural demand and overall inflation\n\n2) Interest rates are likely to remain elevated for longer amid rebound in food prices and fear of generalisation of inflation expectations\n\n3) Slowing exports (both merchandise and services) as global demand moderates and the Indian rupee remains strong versus Asian peers putting pressure on competitiveness.\"\n\n","labels":["financial_success"]}

{"text":"For years, Amazon seemed invincible, an e-commerce giant that made other companies shiver when it muscled into their markets. It helped Amazon stock soar into four-digit territory, and the company's earnings reports often delighted investors.\n\nNow, after a year of troubling earnings reports, Amazon has launched a major restructuring, including plans to cut 27,000 employees from its workforce. Is Amazon stock a buy?\n\nIn late March, Amazon announced plans to slash 9,000 jobs. That's on top of the 18,000 job cuts it announced in January.\n\n\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and head count,\" Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a written notice to employees when the layoffs were announced.  He also suggested more layoffs are possible. The cuts mainly focus on Amazon Web Services, advertising, Twitch, human resources and its stores divisions.\n\nAmazon Jumps Into Artificial Intelligence\nOn April 13, Amazon jumped into the booming field of generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind ChatGPT. Amazon stock climbed on the news, as did other AI companies.\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) previously announced plans to bring ChatGPT to the public. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, plans to target corporate customers.\n\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI software more efficiently and cheaper than competitors can.\n\n\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But it's only been the last five to 10 years that it's started to be used more pervasively by companies,\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\n\nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence.\n\nJassy went on to say: \"We will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\"\n\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have moved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on the booming interest in artificial intelligence technology.\n\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA, maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\n\n\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook, especially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe investors will appreciate Amazon's heightened focus on cost savings and free cash flow,\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on earnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-commerce giant.\n\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4 billion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the prior quarter\n\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed. \"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully profitable,\" he said in his note to clients.\n\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical, giving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well as lab tests and programs for preventive care.\n\n\"We're on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to find, choose, afford and engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay healthy,\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a written statement with the Amazon news release.\n\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid about $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship prescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400 billion pharmacy business.\n\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health care, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\n\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or sell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identifies lower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\n\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential, based on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.\n\nAmazon's Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for stocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\n\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been recovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\n\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price action is so far pretty smooth.\n\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could retard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\n\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a resistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line. Falling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then piercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\n\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines. IBD offers a broad range of growth stock lists, such as Leaderboard and SwingTrader.\n\nInvestors also can create watchlists, find companies nearing a buy point, or develop custom screens at IBD MarketSmith.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Disruption in the automotive industry seems a near-constant force these days. The automotive supply chain continues to suffer hangover challenges from the pandemic (including raw materials shortages and increased labor costs), reduced volumes, stops and starts in OEM production orders and rising interest rates. Despite this, carmakers continue to record rising profits. These factors impact automotive suppliers in particular as many struggle with reduced margins, with some even being driven to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This article will help you understand the key disruptors manufacturers face in the near term, and provide practical tips for surviving (or even thriving) in the face of what Foley\u2019s automotive attorneys see coming down the road.\n\n1.  More automotive suppliers will suffer financial distress, but these will create possible opportunities for growth through acquisition.\n\nLenders who previously provided extensions of credit and forbearance on defaults are increasingly asserting their rights and remedies in the case of new or ongoing defaults by financially distressed automotive suppliers. Variable interest rate facilities have become more burdensome, and it is significantly more difficult for companies to refinance their way out of a loan maturity or cash flow problem. In addition, due to the various financial pressures they face, the automotive industry is experiencing an uptick in suppliers that are considering or have decided to liquidate. Meanwhile, the OEMs project increased sales of vehicles to catch up with pent up demand, and thus production capacity in many parts of the automotive supply chain continues to be highly sought after. \n\nThe cash flow, credit and decreased profitability issues that borrower auto supplier companies face may result in opportunities to purchase them (or their lenders\u2019 debt) at depressed valuations. While these deals may appear to be hard to come by, shrewd investors will be well served by considering both out-of-court and bankruptcy acquisitions of the distressed companies under pressure due to the current environment.  Legal strategies and tactics exist to structure and execute these transactions to reduce risks that may otherwise exist for both the seller (and its management) and the buyer.  Below is an overview of the fundamental strategies of effecting acquisitions outside of a court process, and in bankruptcy, with some key pros and cons.\n\nOut-of-Court Acquisition\n\nOften structured like a normal asset deal.\nDue diligence is even more critical to understand and, where possible, avoid and creatively address, potential liabilities.\nSpecify assumed liabilities and excluded liabilities.\nInclude indemnification and escrow where possible (but seller might not be able to perform under indemnification).\nNegotiations with creditor constituencies can reduce exposure.\nPros:\n\nFast, no court approvals required.\nLess expensive than a court process.\nBuyer can sometimes achieve more control\/certainty and purchase protections than in a court process.\nCan obtain traditional M&A protections (e.g., escrow, rep and warranty insurance, indemnity).\nTypically does not require an auction with competitive bidding.\nPotentially easy on customer\/supplier relationships (subject to contract terms).\nCons:\n\nCannot \u201ccherry pick\u201d contracts as easily as in bankruptcy.\nCannot force support from and bind non-consenting creditors (e.g., lenders).\nRisk of possible successor liability (vs \u201cfree and clear\u201d sale in bankruptcy).\nNeed shareholder consent.\nFraudulent transfer risk where seller does not receive reasonably equivalent\/fair value while insolvent, but consider these protections:\nArm\u2019s-length sale process with consents of key parties.\nValuation opinion.\nStructure through a friendly foreclosure\/Article 9 sale.\nBankruptcy 363 Sale\n\nBuyers often seek to avoid possible successor liability and other risks and require the sale to occur in a Chapter 11 to maximize buyer protections\/rights.\nSection 363 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to sell substantially all of its assets if supported by reasonable business judgment, free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances.\nSection 365 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to assume and assign, or reject, certain contracts and unexpired leases notwithstanding restrictions on assignment in such contracts.\nUpon a bankruptcy filing, the \u201cautomatic stay\u201d arises and protects the seller\u2019s assets from creditor collection efforts and contract terminations to enable a transaction to occur.\nPros:\n\nCourt approved sale is \u201cfree and clear\u201d of liabilities and balance sheet is clean.\nShareholder approval not required.\nEliminates fraudulent transfer risk.\nEnhanced successor liability protection.\nContracts can be \u201ccherry picked\u201d and bad ones left behind, regardless of consent.\nFast (sales can be approved within 30-60 days after a bankruptcy filing).\nClosing likely regardless of objecting creditors.\nBuyer can achieve \u201cstalking horse\u201d advantages: enhanced information, bid protections to protect itself and enhance purchase prospects (e.g., breakup fee and expense reimbursement, and bid increased by same), minimum bid increments and tight timeline for the sale.\nTactic: If buyer owns secured debt \u2013 it can credit bid for increased control.\nCons:\n\nSale will be to the \u201chighest and best bid\u201d; an auction is generally required and, notwithstanding stalking horse advantages, marketing process may yield an alternative winning bidder.\nSecured lender can credit bid its debt to set the floor.\nMore expensive than an out-of-court acquisition.\nUnsecured Creditor Committee appointed in Chapter 11 may delay sale and seek to extract more value.\nPurchase is \u201cas is\u201d \u2013 diminished escrow\/no indemnity.\n2.  An increase in financially distressed automotive suppliers will create threats to continuity of supply and threats to payment from customers. \n\nThe perfect storm of extraordinary factors creating conditions for financial distress throughout the automotive supply chain increases risk that some companies will breach, or threaten to breach, their contracts to supply goods or services, or to pay for the same.  Moreover, some suppliers will be disrupted by the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles.  Not all of these suppliers will have the financial strength to survive in this environment. And yet some of these suppliers may own technology that is valuable for more healthy, well-funded enterprises to opportunistically acquire or license for future use.\n\nFrom a financially challenged supplier perspective, there are possible opportunities for cost recovery.  While costs continue to rise, suppliers who seek cost recovery from their customers and who support their request with transparent and thorough data are more likely to achieve support from their customers. This can be in the form of increased prices, lump sum payments, resolution of commercial disputes and issues, or more profitable go-forward business. These negotiations can solidify the future of an otherwise financially distressed supplier, and actually strengthen long-term relationships within the supply chain to maximize value. Moreover, if the suppliers are in the electric and autonomous vehicle space, federal grants to support this newer portion of the industry are increasingly in play, such as those awarded by the Department of Energy in 2023 to support the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles in the U.S.\n\nBeyond cost recovery or grants for suppliers, critical strategies exist to mitigate supply chain risks and bolster the likelihood that distressed suppliers will continue to perform their obligations to your company and distressed customers will continue to pay your company for goods or services.

{"text":"Apple Vision Pro, Cupertino\u2019s spatial computer, is expected to hit the US market in early 2024. While we previously reported that it would be tough for customers to get their hands on this product, we have also learned more about supply chain issues.\n\nPreviously, The Elec said Sony would produce 900,000 units of OLEDoS per year for Apple\u2019s spatial computer. This technology uses silicon as a substrate to make a high-resolution micro OLED display panel. Cupertino would keep Sony as an exclusive supplier until a second generation of this product.\n\n\nThat said, Apple was worried about the expansiveness of the micro OLED display as Sony couldn\u2019t keep up with production of this technology \u2013 and the Japanese company didn\u2019t want to expand its business. With that in mind, Apple could add LG Display as a possible candidate.\n\nUnfortunately, a new report by the Korean blog The Elec shows that LG decided not to invest in OLEDoS this year. Due to the company\u2019s performance, uncertain profitability, and technological difficulties, LG thought it was best to wait. In addition, supply chain sources say the volume of OLEDoS panels Apple wants isn\u2019t enough for the South Korean company to justify its investments of up to $150 million.\n\nThe publication also notes that Samsung is investing in two types of OLEDoS, one using a color filter on white and the other using RGB method that depois red, green, and blue subpixels adjacent to each other on the same layer.\n\n\nApple uses W-OLED-CF technology, and with Samsung planning to produce OLEDoS tech by 2024, the South Korean company could be a suitable candidate to diversify the Apple Vision Pro supply chain. This possibility was already raised in the past, and it might become a possibility, as it seems Apple won\u2019t have more than 1.3 million headsets available to sell by the end of 2024.\n\nWith that in mind, getting your hands on Apple Vision Pro will be trickier than it seems. Not only does Apple very much rely on Sony, but producing this product is still a challenge. Those living in the US will have difficulty getting this product in-store, and customers from outside the US might take even longer to get a glimpse of Apple\u2019s mixed reality headset.\n\nWe might discover more about this device during Apple\u2019s Wonderlust event, which will take place on September 12.\n\n","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"David Maloni has worked in food supply-chain data analysis for more than a quarter century. But he has never seen a situation with eggs quite like the one playing out across the country right now.\n\nA nationwide egg shortage sparked by a deadly avian influenza outbreak is causing empty shelves and soaring prices, prompting some grocers to limit the number of eggs shoppers can purchase.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever seen prices like this before,\u201d said Maloni, who is a commodity and food supply-chain consultant and president of Sarasota, Florida-based Datum FS. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d\n\nEgg prices were up more than 225% in December over the year before, surging from $1.47 for a dozen large eggs in 2021 to $4.79 a dozen 12 months later. Overall food-at-home prices were up 12% in November, according to federal data. December\u2019s Consumer Price Index numbers are slated to be released Thursday.\n\n\nThe high prices were fueled by soaring demand for eggs for holiday baking, a normal seasonal fluctuation that was magnified by the impact of the bird flu outbreak.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 57.8 million animals are known to have been infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses since January 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes 728 reported outbreaks among wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard or hobbyist flocks in 47 states, the agency said.\n\nEgg-laying chickens have made up the majority of the birds slaughtered in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThose outbreaks have stalled fall egg production by about 5% compared with the same period last year, Maloni said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a time when we have our biggest seasonal increase in demand,\u201d he said.\n\nEgg supply headaches have been especially severe in Colorado, where a state law that went into effect Jan. 1 requires all locally raised chickens to be cage-free if the eggs will be sold in stores. The law is being phased in and will be fully implemented by 2025.\n\nAccording to local reports around the country, a number of grocers are limiting egg purchases to two cartons per customer, including Fred Meyer in Anchorage, Alaska, and a Whole Foods Market in Denver.\n\nThe egg shelves were nearly bare at a Target store on the Northwest Side of Chicago earlier this week, with the few cartons of organic eggs available selling for $7.99 a dozen.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson told WGB that the retail giant had not imposed any egg purchase limits, despite ongoing supply chain challenges.\n\n\u201cHigher demand leading up to the holidays and the impact of avian flu caused tighter supply,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, now demand has returned to normal levels.\u201d\n\nThere are some reasons for sunny side-up optimism in the egg pipeline, Maloni said.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture is forecasting egg production in 2023 to be about 5% higher than the year before and about 2% higher than it was in 2021 and 2020, he noted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good if we can get there,\u201d Maloni said. \u201cThat\u2019s good but it\u2019s probably not good enough.\u201d\n\nWith the holiday season over, demand for eggs will slow. And so too should prices.\n\n\u201cTypically, some of the highest prices will be in December, and then the market will come off about 10% to 20% in January compared to December,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the highest prices hopefully are behind us.\u201d\n\nEgg supply, however, is another story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a little while for it to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should see some of that seasonal decline, but it\u2019s going to take a while for supplies to normalize.\u201d\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"Crypto investors got a rude awakening in August. After a period of relatively calm markets, major cryptocurrencies saw a significant selloff. Bitcoin lost more than 10% of its value within the span of a few days. \n\nAmong the factors being blamed for the most recent decline is the decision by Elon Musk's Space X to sell off a big chunk of its Bitcoin holdings \n[1]\n. But given its track record, Bitcoin's volatility will likely continue, and investors should buckle up. \n\nThough the factors driving each crypto crash are different, it can be helpful to remember a few established investing principles, like choosing how much of your overall portfolio should be invested in crypto and remembering why you invested in the first place.\n\nThe latest market shock is another jarring bump in the road for cryptocurrency, which has seen its value plummet since the highs of 2021. Here's a rundown of a few of the factors that have been driving uncertainty and volatility so far this year.\n\nWhat can cause a crypto crash?\nCrypto prices can be dramatically affected by major events, such as exchanges or coins crashing. They can also sink with higher interest rates, rising inflation and other macroeconomic factors that can affect how confident people feel investing their money in risky alternative assets.\n\nRegulatory factors and financial enforcement actions like those carried out by the SEC can also affect the market.\n\nAnd when prices fall rapidly, that can compound the pressure on the market by forcing some investors to free up cash so they can meet other obligations.\n\nIn the case of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 , the impact to the market was enormous. The FTX crash didn't just affect FTX, but also cryptocurrencies FTX heavily invested in (such as Solana) and firms FTX did business with. \n\nThe crypto exchange BlockFi, which received a line of credit from FTX.US and was set to be acquired by the company later in the year, froze withdrawals before filing for bankruptcy itself a few weeks after FTX did.\n\nHas crypto crashed before? \nYes, multiple times. For example, Bitcoin recorded a previous record high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, but by December 2018 was trading below $3,500. It reached an all-time high of about $69,000 in November 2021 and in the year since dropped by more than 75%.\n\nI\u2019m worried about keeping my crypto with an exchange. What should I do?\nConsider moving your digital assets to a separate crypto wallet. Most exchanges allow you to transfer assets to these wallets, which can be online (on a separate platform) or offline (on a thumb drive with added security features).\n\nWhat are the risks of buying crypto?\nWhen crypto is crashing, someone who's been intrigued from the sideline might think this is the time to get in and \"buy low.\" But while prices can recover \u2014 and have done so in the past \u2014 the recovery could take months or years.\n\nConditions might also get worse before they get better. Following a major crash, prices could also continue to go down for some time, especially if the event causes financial troubles for other exchanges or currencies.\n\nUnlike traditional financial exchanges, crypto markets don't have circuit breakers, which automatically pause trading when prices dive too quickly. This means prices could plunge much faster than traditional investments.\n\nAnother distinction between crypto and securities such as stocks is that crypto trades around the clock. If you're worried about swings in value, you might find it hard to sleep. \n\nThere's also a chance any given cryptocurrency could go to zero, or close to zero, following a massive sell-off. Such was the case with Terra and Luna.\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}

{"text":"The pandemic was an economic boon for the nation\u2019s tech centers last year, but the tide already has turned as consumers\u2019 demand for remote work software, delivered food, and streaming entertainment subsides.\n\nTech-driven counties in California\u2019s Silicon Valley and around Seattle, Washington, and Austin, Texas, boomed as the COVID-19 pandemic raged, according to a Stateline analysis of new data on economic output released this month by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThe analysis of 2019 to 2021 changes in county-by-county gross domestic product, known as GDP, shows how local economies fared in the early months of the pandemic, an indicator of how Americans responded at a time when many were staying home and supply chain problems interrupted some consumer buying.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic came along, we all thought it was going to be a crippling blow to our economy, but we were wrong. It was a bonanza,\u201d said Russell Hancock, CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a private-public economic development group based in Santa Clara County.\n\nRemote work fed demand for Apple devices and online-based services such as Zoom, DoorDash, and Netflix, all based in Silicon Valley, he said. The latest year has not gone as well for tech firms in the pandemic boom towns.\n\n\u201cIt was a spike, and it came back down. We\u2019re adjusting,\u201d Hancock said.\n\nSanta Clara County saw the biggest bump in real GDP for a large county between 2019 and 2021, up 19%. Austin\u2019s Travis County grew 14%, and Seattle\u2019s King County grew 13%. Real GDP measures economic output as the total value of goods and services produced in the county, adjusted for inflation.\n\nOther counties with populations of at least a million people and with fast-growing economies from 2019 to 2021 were mostly in the Sun Belt, where jobs and population boomed: Collin County, Texas (up 12%); Palm Beach County, Florida, and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (both up 9%); and the trio of Salt Lake County, Utah, Hillsborough County, Florida, and Maricopa County, Arizona (all up 8%).\n\nIn Washington state, King County software design at companies such as Microsoft and online sales from Amazon helped the county boom despise job losses in tourism and manufacturing, said David Reich, chief economist for the county\u2019s Office of Economic and Financial Analysis.\n\n\u201cThe [tech] sector was really important in providing the tools we needed during the pandemic, even if most of those workers were working remotely,\u201d Reich said, adding that tech provided 85% of the county\u2019s boost in GDP.\n\nIn Texas, the Austin area hosts tech companies such as Dell and Oracle.\n\nMany of the hot tech economies have cooled this year. King County\u2019s latest economic indicators, compiled by Reich, show last year\u2019s spike dropping back to 2019 levels this year. Tech employment has fallen as big tech firms such as Microsoft and Amazon and online real-estate firms like Redfin and Zillow have announced layoffs, Reich said.\n\nBut overall, jobs are up in the Seattle area as tourism returns, drawing more cruise ships and hotel stays. That bodes well for continued, if slower, improvement this year and in 2023, according to King County\u2019s latest projections.\n\nThe same patterns hold true in other areas, said Adam Kamins, senior director at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n\u201cRunaway growth in tech-dependent counties has likely cooled considerably in 2022,\u201d Kamins said. Tech companies in Silicon Valley and Seattle are considering more layoffs, and more offices in Austin are becoming vacant due to layoffs and hiring freezes.\n\nThe biggest GDP loss from 2019 to 2021, 6%, also was in California, in Contra Costa County, east of Oakland, where more conventional manufacturing did not fare well in the pandemic.\n\nMarathon Oil shuttered a refinery in Contra Costa County, laying off more than 700 workers, and manufacturer Posco in Pittsburg, a Contra Costa County city, laid off 216 workers in 2020.\n\n\u201cThroughout the pandemic, working people lost so much while a select few saw record profits,\u201d said Joshua Anijar, director of the Contra Costa Central Labor Council, a union group. Tech workers have started moving in as housing prices spiral in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the area\u2019s manufacturing legacy is disappearing. Today, the Posco plant is preparing to shut down, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to continue to be an industrial county or just another suburb of Oakland and San Francisco,\u201d Anijar said. \u201cWe\u2019re only now starting to see the full effects of the pandemic. At first, we saw the tourism areas suffering, but that\u2019s not us.\u201d\n\nTourism centers in Hawaii and Nevada also saw losses as travelers stayed close to home.\n\nHonolulu lost 5% of GDP from 2019 to 2021 as tourism and convention business had not bounced back. This year, visitor arrivals and spending are up in Hawaii, according to a November state report, and are close to recovering to 2019 levels.\n\nOther counties losing GDP were Queens, New York, (down 4%) and the Bronx (down 2%) where services and hospitality such as restaurants had not recovered. Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located, lost 1% between 2019 and 2021 with energy the main culprit, before oil prices spiked this year.\n\nClark County, Nevada, home of Las Vegas, and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, also had 1% drops.\n\nTourism rebounds and higher oil prices likely have helped places with shrinking economies, Kamins said.\n\n\u201cThe New York City boroughs have stabilized and probably made up some ground this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more pronounced rebounds are likely in Houston due to the impact of high oil prices, and around Honolulu, as tourism and business travel have largely returned.\u201d\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","financial_success"]}
{"text":"Here\u2019s an important and arguably unappreciated ingredient in the glue that holds society together: Google makes it moderately difficult to learn how to commit an act of terrorism. The first several pages of results for a Google search on how to build a bomb, or how to commit a murder, or how to unleash a biological or chemical weapon, won\u2019t actually tell you much about how to do it.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible to learn these things off the internet. People have successfully built working bombs from publicly available information. Scientists have warned others against publishing the blueprints for deadly viruses because of similar fears. But while the information is surely out there on the internet, it\u2019s not straightforward to learn how to kill lots of people, thanks to a concerted effort by Google and other search engines.\n\nHow many lives does that save? That\u2019s a hard question to answer. It\u2019s not as if we could responsibly run a controlled experiment where sometimes instructions about how to commit great atrocities are easy to look up and sometimes they aren\u2019t.\n\nBut it turns out we might be irresponsibly running an uncontrolled experiment in just that, thanks to rapid advances in large language models (LLMs).\n\nSecurity through obscurity\nWhen first released, AI systems like ChatGPT were generally willing to give detailed, correct instructions about how to carry out a biological weapons attack or build a bomb. Over time, Open AI has corrected this tendency, for the most part. But a class exercise at MIT, written up in a preprint paper earlier this month and covered last week in Science, found that it was easy for groups of undergraduates without relevant background in biology to get detailed suggestions for biological weaponry out of AI systems.\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 More than a year and a half after the COVID-19 pandemic began to rock supply chains around the world, the defense industry is still wrestling with its fallout \u2014 and figuring out how to move forward amid the turmoil.\n\nFrom massive deliveries of steel and aluminum needed to build the U.S. military\u2019s newest ships and aircraft to landing gear brakes to items as small as semiconductors, supply chain shortages or delays have upended the plans of defense firms of all sizes.\n\n\nMuch of the nation\u2019s broader attention on supply chains has focused on the rising costs of feeding a family or worried parents scrambling to order presents well before Christmas to ensure Santa will have something to leave under the tree.\n\nBut those in the defense industry are increasingly making clear the challenges they\u2019re facing \u2014 and Pentagon officials are taking notice as they consider what this means for their own logistics.\n\nSupply chain issues sparked by the pandemic were a recurring theme during recent contractor earnings calls. One major defense firm after another pointed to the problems they faced, in some cases as an explanation for lower-than-expected sales.\n\n\nThese issues dealt a significant blow to the aerospace and defense industry, according to the Aerospace Industries Association. In 2020, the industry as a whole lost more than 87,000 jobs, or about 4% of the 2019 headcount, according to an AIA report released in September.\n\nAnd 64% of those losses \u2014 or at least 55,700 jobs \u2014 were due to the supply chain problems that particularly ensnared small and medium-sized businesses nationwide, John Luddy, AIA\u2019s vice president for national security policy, said in a statement to Defense News.\n\nSupply chains problems can stem from a variety of issues, such as a lack of raw materials to make vital parts; bottlenecks when trying to transport finished items, like a shortage of shipping containers; backlogged ports without enough people to unload shipments; or a dearth of trucks available to drive items across the country. Financing challenges also dealt another blow to those small firms, AIA said.\n\n\u201cBecause end-use manufacturers rely on the vital components and products those [small and medium-sized aerospace and defense] companies produce, such as bolts, wiring, hoses and electronics, those losses in employees, revenue and products had serious ripple effects throughout the rest of the A&D industry,\u201d Luddy said.\n\n\nSome firms have seen pandemic-driven workforce problems contribute to supply chain issues. Before the COVID-19 vaccines, this was typically driven by the need to maintain social distancing and a workforce concerned about contracting the dangerous virus. Now, controversies involving vaccine mandates are throwing a new curveball into companies\u2019 efforts to remain fully staffed.\n\nSmall companies with slimmer profit margins have found weathering supply chain upheavals particularly challenging, said ML Mackey, chair of the small business division for the National Defense Industrial Association and chief executive of the defense IT contractor Beacon Interactive Systems.\n\n\u201cWhen something hits us, the waves are much harder,\u201d Mackey said in a Nov. 19 interview. \u201cA big ship can handle the waves. But a canoe? It\u2019s bobbled around.\u201d\n\nThose small firms tend to be \u201cniche\u201d companies that specialize in one component or just a handful, Mackey said. Those parts, while niche, can be critical for the military to keep planes, weapons systems or other equipment operational, she said.\n\n\nBut when those small businesses encounter turmoil \u2014 from workforce challenges or programming inconsistency from the Pentagon, which is relying on continuing resolutions until formal spending bills are passed \u2014 the upheaval throws a wrench in the broader supply chains they feed.\n\n\u201cOur bottoms are closer to the bottom line,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cThere\u2019s no extra in our game. \u2026 It\u2019s not that [small businesses] need it to be easy, it just has to be consistent so we know how to engage and compete effectively.\u201d\n\nFor want of a nail\nMultiple defense firms contacted by Defense News declined to elaborate on their supply chain issues, instead pointing to statements made by executives during earnings calls or in other public forums. But even those limited statements speak volumes about how supply chain hiccups have tested the defense industry.\n\nJohn Mollard, acting chief financial officer for Lockheed Martin, said in an Oct. 26 call that larger-than-expected supply chain problems in its missiles and fire control, space, and aeronautics divisions \u2014 particularly in relation to F-35 fighter jet production \u2014 spanned multiple suppliers, leading to reduced sales in the third quarter.\n\n\nThe executive said the disruptions \u201cunderscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic.\u201d\n\nHe added that dual-use suppliers \u2014 those who make parts used by both the military and civilian aerospace sectors \u2014 accounted for much of the supply chain challenges faced by Lockheed. For example, he said, a company that makes landing gear brakes for both military and commercial aircraft saw a cash flow crunch as the pandemic kneecapped the commercial air sector.\n\nLockheed has taken steps to help its suppliers stay afloat, Mollard said, including by accelerating billions of dollars in payments to companies that make up its supply chain.\n\nHe also said Lockheed plans to keep steering payments to suppliers harmed by the pandemic \u2014 particularly small and medium-sized businesses \u2014 through the end of 2022 to ensure they can continue operations. Lockheed originally thought it would be able to cease those accelerated payments after this year, he explained.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s voluntary, it\u2019s not 100% altruistic,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWe need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful.\u201d\n\nGreg Hayes, Raytheon Technologies\u2019 chief executive, said in an Oct. 26 call that his company took a $275 million sales hit due to a combination of supply chain issues and a lack of employees. Hayes said the \u201cpeople part\u201d accounted for about a third of that $275 million loss, meaning supply chain problems cost the company about $180 million.\n\nHayes said the difficulties aren\u2019t stemming from a single supplier. \u201cThink about aluminum prices going up, think about all of the steel, all of the basic raw materials, lead times pushing out, and it\u2019s just harder to get material in the door on time,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Raytheon has benefited from long-term agreements for raw materials, he noted, lead times on some of them have doubled. He said the company has an adequate supply of computer chips, but that executives are keeping a close eye on the situation to ensure the supply doesn\u2019t fall short.\n\nHayes also said the labor shortage problem is likely to continue into the new year. The vaccine mandate could also put more pressure on the supply chain in the short term, he said, referring to an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in September requiring all federal employees and government contractors to be vaccinated, though the timeline and details have shifted on several occasions.\n\nIn the long term, he said, a higher vaccination rate could restore people\u2019s confidence in the safety of air travel, and therefore hasten economic recovery.\n\nChris Kubasik, the chief executive of L3Harris Technologies, said in the company\u2019s Oct. 29 earnings call that electronic component shortages in recent months dealt a blow to the firm \u2014 particularly in its communication systems division, as well as to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft \u2014 and led the business to slightly trim its sales growth expectations.\n\n\u201cNo company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures,\u201d Kubasik said, predicting supply chain issues will continue well into 2022, with recovery beginning in the latter half of the year.\n\nBut L3Harris has also sought workarounds. Jay Malave, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said L3Harris has looked for alternative sources and parts, and even redesigned some of its electronic components.\n\nShipbuilders have also strained at times to keep their supplies afloat. Thomas Stiehle, chief financial officer for Huntington Ingalls Industries, said in a Nov. 5 earnings call that copper cabling was one example of a material putting pressure on suppliers and the shipbuilding industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little light on material, specifically at Ingalls\u201d Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, Stiehle said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about shipbuilding, the material lag-behind [cost] roughly about $40 million in the [third] quarter. And as we look forward into [the fourth quarter], that could persist.\u201d\n\nDirk Lesko, president of General Dynamics\u2019 Bath Iron Works in Maine, told Defense News the supply chain troubles are \u201cunpredictable\u201d and apply to \u201ceverything \u2014 simple and complex things that we buy.\u201d\n\nLt. Gen. Clinton Hinote, the Air Force\u2019s deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said in a Nov. 16 online panel that the military is seeing the same supply chain issues as the civilian world. If a major conflict were to break out, the military\u2019s fragile logistics infrastructure could prove to be a vulnerability, Hinote said.\n\n\u201cWe certainly see the problems in the civilian supply chain right now,\u201d he explained. \u201cThose also manifest themselves in military supply chains. In many ways, those supply chains are brittle, and we could make decisions to make those more resilient and less brittle.\u201d","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}
