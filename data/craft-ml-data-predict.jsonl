{"text":"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive (PTON.O) said it expects to burn cash in the next two quarters due to costs related to bike recall and other expenses, delaying return to a positive cash flow and sending its shares to a record low.\n\nIt also posted results on Wednesday that failed to lift the gloom around the company, which has been struggling with waning demand for its fitness equipment as consumers return to gyms and spend more on travel and experiences.\n\nPeloton cut costs last year to deal with a slump in demand and had hoped to achieve positive free cash flow by fiscal 2023, which ended on June 30.\n\nBut it later tempered that goal to a breakeven cash flow due to a recall of 2.2 million exercise bikes following a seat issue and a $75 million settlement agreement with DISH Technologies.\n\n\"The cost of this recall substantially exceeded our initial expectations, leading to an additional accrual of $40 million (in Q4) for actual costs incurred as well as anticipated future recall-related expenses,\" Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy said.\n\nThe company forecast first-quarter revenue between $580 million and $600 million, below Refinitiv estimates of $655.9 million.\n\nMcCarthy also added the company would ramp up marketing spending ahead of the key holiday season later this year, which will further pressure cash flows.

{"text":"Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have agreed to extend their merger agreement pending the outcome of negotiations with UK regulators. Both parties will now have until October 18th to finalize the transaction, after missing yesterday\u2019s original deal deadline.\n\n\u201cThe recent decision in the US and approvals in 40 countries all validate that the deal is good for competition, players, and the future of gaming,\u201d tweeted Lulu Cheng Meservey, Activision Blizzard\u2019s CCO and EVP of corporate affairs. \u201cGiven global regulatory approvals and the companies\u2019 confidence that CMA now recognizes there are remedies available to meet their concerns in the UK, the Activision Blizzard and Microsoft boards of directors have authorized the companies not to terminate the deal until after October 18.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft vice chair and president Brad Smith says the three-month extension is designed \u201cto provide ample time to work through the final regulatory issues.\u201d\n\nBoth Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have also agreed to a higher termination fee and new commercial arrangements for the transaction. A termination fee, payable if Microsoft or Activision walks away from the deal, is now set at $3.5 billion if the deal doesn\u2019t close by August 29th, and it jumps to $4.5 billion if September 15th passes without a finalization.\n\nActivision has also agreed to potentially \u201chold separate the Company or certain assets of the Company or to implement other lawful alternatives to consummate the Merger\u201d with UK regulators. This is a key part, as it may allow the merger to go ahead with restrictions from the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nThis three-month delay is related to Microsoft\u2019s ongoing negotiations with the CMA. The UK regulator originally blocked the deal over cloud gaming concerns earlier this year. While Microsoft has appealed that decision, the company is also preparing to reportedly offer a new proposal to sell off its rights to cloud gaming in the UK to try and get the deal over the line.\n\nThe merger extension comes after a case management conference in the UK on Monday, where the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) agreed to allow Microsoft and CMA to negotiate a way to close the deal and pause the appeal process. The CMA made it clear earlier this week that Microsoft had not yet submitted its final proposal, and the regulator now has until Thursday at midday to file all the relevant evidence to the CAT for the tribunal judges to officially put the pause of the appeal in place.\n\nMicrosoft had originally planned to close its Activision Blizzard deal by July 18th, but the complex situation in the UK has added some extra time to the process. While there is plenty of regulatory work to do in the UK to analyze a change to the transaction, Microsoft is extending its deal deadline date to avoid it falling through if Activision Blizzard decided to walk away or the unlikely scenario of another company attempting to offer better terms for an acquisition.\n\nReading between the lines it looks like Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are aiming for a lot sooner than October 18th. The CMA also said last week that it will now issue a final order by August 29th, and Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have agreed an termination fee increase to $3.5 billion for that same date. That suggests there\u2019s a realistic prospect of Microsoft\u2019s proposal to the CMA being complete by August 29th, but the company has a lot longer should the regulator need to more fully investigate its changes to the terms of the deal.\n\nFinally, in an internal memo to Xbox employees, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d about the acquisition still being finalized:\n\nTeam,\n\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard remain optimistic that we will get our acquisition over the finish line, so we have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement to October 18, 2023. While we can technically close in the United States due to recent legal developments, this extension gives us additional time to resolve the remaining regulatory concerns in the UK.\n\nI want to thank everyone for your time and energy in support of the regulatory process and on all the great work coming to fruition for Xbox this year. Players around the world will be delighted with the incredible lineup of games launching in the next few months, including Starfield and Forza Motorsport. It is also great to see the fantastic work the ABK teams are delivering for their players with the successful launch of Diablo IV and the ongoing performance of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and we congratulate them on their accomplishments.\n\nAs we move even closer to the finish line, we are more excited than ever before about furthering our mission to bring more games to more players everywhere.\n\nPhil","labels":[]}
{"text":"Amazon\n warehouses are a more dangerous place to work than comparable facilities, new federal injury data shows.\n\nIn 2022, there were 6.6 serious injuries for every 100 Amazon workers, according to a report released Wednesday from the union coalition Strategic Organizing Center, which relies on data submitted by Amazon to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. That\u2019s more than double the rate of all non-Amazon warehouses, which had 3.2 serious injuries for every 100 workers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s serious injury rate fell by about 3% between 2021 and 2022. The rate shot up to 6.8 serious injuries for every 100 workers in 2021, compared to a rate of 5.9 serious injuries for every 100 workers in 2020. Amazon previously attributed the jump to a warehouse hiring push during the pandemic.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has significantly pared its head count in the last year as it acknowledged it hired too many workers, as CEO Andy Jassy looks to cut costs across the company. Amazon had 1.54 million employees globally at the end of the fourth quarter, down 4% from the year-earlier period.\n\nThe SOC report argues that Amazon has \u201cnot made meaningful progress\u201d on its total rate of injuries or serious injuries between 2017 and 2022, the six-year period in which it has data. Until 2020, OSHA did not release full injury and illness records submitted by employers, claiming that more detailed logs contained confidential commercial information. That changed after a lawsuit filed by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and labor group Public Citizen forced OSHA to release the data.\n\nWhile Amazon\u2019s serious injury rate fell between 2021 and 2022, its overall injuries increased. Amazon reported 39,000 total injuries at its U.S. facilities in 2022, up from 38,300 total injuries in 2021.\n\nThe data suggests that injuries experienced by workers at the company are more frequent and severe than other warehouse workers, SOC said. In 2022, Amazon was responsible for more than half of all serious injuries in the warehousing industry, while making up 36% of its workers, according to the report.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the SOC\u2019s findings \u201cpaint an inaccurate picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe safety and health of our employees is, and always will be, our top priority, and any claim otherwise is inaccurate,\u201d Nantel said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the progress made by our team and we\u2019ll continue working hard together to keep getting better every day.\u201d\n\nAmazon also disputed the SOC\u2019s use of the term \u201cserious injury rate,\u201d saying it\u2019s not a regulatory metric. The company said the term could capture any injury that could lead to an employee taking time away from work, or spending time working in another role, including what it considers to be minor injuries, such as a strain that might require a worker to avoid lifting heavy boxes.\n\nAmazon claims its lost time incident rate, which measures the number of incidents that require workers to take time off, is below the warehousing industry average.\n\nLabor advocates have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s workplace safety record in their efforts to organize its facilities. Employees continue to point to the company\u2019s productivity demands and the strenuous nature of the job as a catalyst behind high injury rates. Several states including New York, Washington and California have passed laws taking aim at Amazon\u2019s work quotas.\n\nFederal inspectors have repeatedly levied fines against the company at several facilities over various safety violations. OSHA cited Amazon at six of its warehouses for failing to report workplace injuries and exposing workers to ergonomic hazards. Those citations followed inspections by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York at multiple sites, and the office\u2019s probe is ongoing.\n\nLast March, the state of Washington\u2019s Department of Labor and Industries cited Amazon\u2019s flagship facility in Kent, Washington, over unsafe work practices. The agency found that many Amazon jobs involve \u201crepetitive motions, lifting, carrying, twisting, and other physical work\u201d and said workers are required to perform these tasks \u201cat such a fast pace that it increases the risk of injury.\u201d\n\nAmazon has appealed the fines and in October filed a lawsuit against the agency, asking a judge to set aside the orders to reduce hazards on the grounds that they violate the due process protections under the 14th Amendment.\n\nAmazon said it doesn\u2019t have fixed quotas, but that it has performance expectations \u201clike any business.\u201d The company said it investigates any reports of managers misusing productivity guidance.\n\nThe SDNY, a division of the Department of Justice, is also investigating whether Amazon made \u201cfalse representations\u201d to lenders about its workplace safety record to obtain credit.\n\nAmazon said it will appeal the OSHA citations. It also said it disagrees with the SDNY\u2019s allegations.\n\nThe company has previously defended its safety record, and it says it plans to invest $550 million on safety initiatives in 2023, after spending roughly $1 billion on improving safety between 2019 and 2022.\n\nJassy has said Amazon\u2019s injury rates are \u201csometimes misunderstood,\u201d but he acknowledged Amazon can do more to improve safety inside its facilities. In 2021, Amazon set a goal to halve its warehouse injury rate by 2025.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021 pledged to make the company \u201cEarth\u2019s Best Employer\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.\u201d Shortly afterward, Amazon rolled out WorkingWell, a series of programs designed to prevent workplace injuries in its warehouses by encouraging stretching and healthy eating habits, among other things.","labels":[]}

{"text":"New York\nCNN\n \u2014 \nBed Bath & Beyond, the store for seemingly everything in your home during the 1990s and 2000s, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThank you to all of our loyal customers. We have made the difficult decision to begin winding down our operations,\u201d a statement at the top of the company\u2019s website said Sunday morning.\n\nThe company\u2019s 360 Bed Bath & Beyond locations, along with its 120 buybuy BABY stores, will remain open for now, as will websites. The company secured a $240 million loan to help fund its operations during bankruptcy.\n\nBut store closing sales will begin Wednesday, and Bed Bath & Beyond will close some stores. Just how many \u2013 or what happens to its 14,000 employees \u2013depends on what happens next.\n\nA bankruptcy filing does not necessarily mean that a company is going out of business. Many major US companies have filed for bankruptcy, using it to shed debt and other costs they could no longer afford. But even if Bed Bath and Beyond does emerge from bankruptcy, its future is not guaranteed.\n\nThe company said it would seek to sell some or all of its business. If it\u2019s able to find a buyer, Bed Bath & Beyond will halt store closings. But if a buyer doesn\u2019t come forward, Bed Bath & Beyond will likely be liquidated entirely and go out of business.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the company could emerge from bankruptcy as an online-only retailer, said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if it emerges from bankruptcy at all, Bed Bath & Beyond will be a shadow of its former self,\u201d he said.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond had been a crown jewel of the era of so-called \u201ccategory killers\u201d \u2014 chains that dominated a category of retail, such as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Circuit City and Sports Authority. Those companies, too, ultimately filed for bankruptcy as shoppers turned away from huge specialty stores in favor of online options like Amazon.\n\nChris Hammons unloads a bag of items she purchased at a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Dallas, Texas September 23, 2009. \nChris Hammons unloads a bag of items she purchased at a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Dallas, Texas September 23, 2009.\nJessica Rinaldi\/Reuters\nBed Bath & Beyond became known for pots and pans, towels and bedding stacked from the floor to the ceiling at its cavernous stores \u2014 and for its ubiquitous 20%-off coupons. The blue-and-white coupons became something of a pop culture symbol, and millions of Americans wound up stashing them away in their cars, closets and basements.\n\nThe company said customers will have Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to use their remaining 20%-off coupons. The company will stop accepting them Wednesday. Instead, Bed Bath & Beyond expects to offer \u201cdeep discounts\u201d on its products as part of its going-out-of-business sales.\n\nThe retailer attracted a broad range of customers by selling name brands at cut-rate prices. Brands coveted a spot on Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s shelves, knowing it would lead to big sales. Plus, the open-store layout encouraged impulse buying: Shoppers would come in to buy new dishes and walk out with pillows, towels and other items.\n\nStores were a fixture for shoppers around the winter holidays and during the back-to-school and college seasons, and Bed Bath & Beyond also had a strong baby and wedding registry business.\n\nBut the New Jersey-based company has been slow to respond to shopping changes and struggled to entice customers who had moved on to Amazon, Target and other chains.\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond said it had $5.2 billion in debt and assets of just $4.4 billion. It secured $240 million in financing Sunday to stay afloat just long enough to close its stores and wind down its operations.\n\nThe company encouraged shoppers to seek out its discounted merchandise later this week. Items purchased before Wednesday can be returned until May 24, but all sales after Wednesday will be final. The store will stop accepting gift cards on May 8.\n\nSuperstore era\nFounded in 1971 by Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, two veterans of the discount retail industry in Springfield, New Jersey, the chain of small linen and bath stores \u2014 then called Bed \u2018n Bath \u2014 first grew around the northeast and in California selling designer bedding, a new trend at the time. Unlike department stores, it didn\u2019t rely on sales events to draw in customers.\n\nThe company changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987 to reflect its expanded merchandise and bigger \u201csuperstores.\u201d The company went public in 1992 with 38 stores and around $200 million in sales.\n\n\u201cWe had witnessed the department store shakeout and knew that specialty stores were going to be the next wave of retailing,\u201d Feinstein said in 1993. \u201cIt was the beginning of the designer approach to linens and housewares and we saw a real window of opportunity.\u201d\n\nCustomers examining items in shopping carts at a Bed, Bath & Beyond store in New York City on January 18, 1994.\nCustomers examining items in shopping carts at a Bed, Bath & Beyond store in New York City on January 18, 1994.\nMark Peterson\/Corbis\/Getty Images\nBy 2000, those figures leapt to 241 stores and $1.1 billion in annual sales. The 1,000th Bed Bath & Beyond store opened in 2009, when the chain had reached $7.8 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe company was something of an iconoclast. It spent little on advertising, relying instead on print coupons distributed in weekly newspapers to attract customers.\n\n\u201cWhy not just tell the customer that we\u2019ll give you a discount on the item you want \u2014 and not the one that we want to put on sale? We\u2019ll mail a coupon, and it will be a lot cheaper,\u201d Eisenberg said in a 2020 New York Times interview.\n\nThe chain was known for giving autonomy to store managers to decide which products to stock, allowing them to customize their individual stores, and for shipping products directly to stores instead of a central warehouse.\n\nThe rise of online shopping\nBut as brick-and-mortar began to give way to e-commerce, Bed Bath & Beyond was slow to make the transition \u2014 a misstep compounded by the fact that home decor is one of the most commonly bought categories online.\n\n\u201cWe missed the boat on the internet,\u201d Eisenberg said in a recent Wall Street Journal interview. (The co-founders are no longer involved with the company.)\n\nOnline shopping weakened the allure of Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s fan-favorite coupons, too, because consumers could find plenty of cheaper alternatives on Amazon or browse a wider selection on sites like Wayfair (W).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Amazon and online shopping that sank Bed Bath & Beyond, however.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) have grown over the past decade, and they have been able to draw Bed Bath & Beyond customers with lower prices and a wider array of merchandise. Discount chains such as HomeGoods and TJ Maxx have also undercut Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s prices.\n\nWithout the differentiators of the lowest prices or widest selection, Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s sales stagnated from 2012 to 2019.\n\nShoppers inspect cleaning supplies while shopping inside of a Bed Bath & Beyond store in New York April 13, 2011.\nShoppers inspect cleaning supplies while shopping inside of a Bed Bath & Beyond store in New York April 13, 2011.\nLucas Jackson\/Reuters\nThen the pandemic hit in 2020. The company temporarily closed all of its stores while rivals deemed \u201cessential retailers\u201d like Walmart remained open. Sales sank 17% in 2020 and 15% in 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Bed Bath & Beyond has rotated through several different executives and turnaround strategies in recent years.\n\nFormer Target executive Mark Tritton took the helm in 2019 with backing from investors and a bold new strategy. He scaled back coupons and inventory from national brands in favor of Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s own private-label brands.\n\nBut this change alienated customers who were loyal to big brands. The company also fell behind on payments to vendors, and stores did not have enough merchandise to stock shelves. Tritton stepped down as CEO in 2022.\n\nScramble to avoid bankruptcy\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy for months.\n\nIn February, it was able to stave off bankruptcy by completing a complex stock offering that gave it both an immediate injection of cash and a pledge for more funding in the future to pay down its debt. That offering was backed by private equity group Hudson Bay Capital.\n\nBut Bed Bath & Beyond last month said it terminated the deal with Hudson Bay Capital for future funding and was turning to the public market to try to raise funds.\n\nThe company has also been shrinking to save money. It said earlier this year it would close around 400 locations, but would keep open profitable stores in key markets.\n\nAnd the company tried to save money by not paying severance to some laid-off workers at closing stores.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond laid off 1,295 workers in New Jersey this month, just days before a new state law kicked in that mandates severance pay \u2014 equal to one week of pay for each year of employment \u2014 for workers who lose their job.\n\nAll these moves were not enough to keep the once-dominant chain out of bankruptcy, however.\n\nAnd Bed Bath & Beyond is the latest retail chain to file for bankruptcy this year. Bankruptcies are piling up in the retail sector as interest rates go up and discretionary spending slows down.\n\nDavid\u2019s Bridal, Party City, Tuesday Morning, mattress manufacturer Serta Simmons and Independent Pet Partners, a pet store retailer, have filed for bankruptcy in recent weeks.","labels":[]}
{"text":"Digital transformation is a top business priority, with 74 percent of companies putting it on the top of their lists of new technology initiatives.\n\nBut transformation alone isn\u2019t enough. Organizations must also consider the impact of technology on environmental, social and financial bottom lines to create sustainable digital environments. Here\u2019s what that means and how to achieve it.\nWhat Does Digital Sustainability Really Mean?\nDigital sustainability includes considering the environmental impacts of an organization\u2019s technology, of course. But today, leaders are also factoring social and financial factors into their understanding of sustainability. That way of thinking is new, says Robert DeVito, global director of Chrome customer and partner sales engineering at Google.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, people assumed sustainability meant the environment,\u201d DeVito says. \u201cNow it encompasses all aspects of digital transformation.\u201d\n\nThe goal of digital sustainability is to create a self-reinforcing system that facilitates success across all three components. For example, if companies can reuse older devices by equipping them with modern collaboration and security features \u2014 and spend less money doing so than they would replacing them \u2014 that\u2019s a sustainability win.\n\nGoogle helps companies achieve this goal with ChromeOS and ChromeOS Flex, a cloud-based version of the ChromeOS operating system that can be installed on Apple and Microsoft devices using a 16-gigabyte USB. \u201cYou simply plug it in, go into the BIOS, and boot to the USB,\u201d says DeVito. \u201cThis gives you two options: Wipe away the prior OS and replace it with ChromeOS, or just try ChromeOS on the USB.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, people assumed sustainability meant the environment. Now it encompasses all aspects of digital transformation.\u201d\nRobert DeVito Global Director of Chrome Customer and Partner Sales Engineering, Google\n\nWhat Does Digital Sustainability Success Look Like?\nIdeal business outcomes are no longer measured by profitability alone. Instead, Google sees success as a triple bottom line that can be measured with environmental, social and financial metrics.\n\nEnvironmental: \u201cFrom an environmental perspective, we\u2019re very lightweight,\u201d DeVito says of the Chrome line. \u201cChromeOS Flex is cloud-based and offers reduced power consumption.\u201d This allows companies to reduce e-waste by wiping the existing OS layer on old hardware and layering ChromeOS on top. Enterprises can also choose to make the move from legacy hardware to newer Chromebooks.

{"text":"New Mexico and the U.S. government have reached a $32 million settlement over a 2015 mine spill that polluted rivers in three western states.\n\nSimilar environmental accidents will be intolerable in the future as the region grapples with shrinking water supplies amid drought and climate change, the governor said Thursday.\n\n\u201cEvery drop is precious,\u201d Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said during a news conference. \u201cIf we don't have that water, we aren't growing our own food.\u201d\n\nThe spill released 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of wastewater from the inactive Gold King Mine in southwestern Colorado, sending a bright-yellow plume of arsenic, lead and other heavy metals south to New Mexico, through the Navajo Nation and into Utah through the San Juan and Animas rivers.\n\nWater utilities were forced to scramble and shut down intake valves while farmers stopped drawing from the rivers as the contaminants moved downstream.\n\nThe New Mexico settlement marks just the latest reached over the past year. Colorado and the Navajo Nation also have inked multimillion-dollar agreements to settle claims and sort out responsibility for continued cleanup at the Superfund site that was established following the spill.\n\nUnder the New Mexico agreement, the federal government will make cash payments for response costs, environmental restoration and efforts to mitigate the negative perceptions about the area's rivers following the spill. Money also will go toward water quality monitoring and cleanup activities.\n\nLujan Grisham called the settlement a turning point for communities in the region.\n\n\"While the San Juan and Animas rivers have healed from the spill, it\u2019s time for communities like Farmington, Bloomfield, and Aztec to do the same,\u201d she said in a statement, saying the money is deserved in light of the federal government's role in the disaster.\n\nThe state also received $11 million in damages from the mining companies, and the case against the federal contractors involved is pending.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2015, Environmental Protection Agency contractors attempting cleanup work caused the release of the toxic wastewater. The plume eventually reached Lake Powell in Utah.\n\nAlthough the rivers are now safe for irrigation and other uses, state and local officials have said the stigma associated with the event has had lasting effects on the region\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Navajo Nation finalized a $31 million settlement with the federal government this week. The tribe said the plume had traveled through an estimated 200 miles (322 kilometers) of the San Juan River, which it considers sacred.\n\nTop Navajo officials traveled to the mine site and shared photos and video of the wastewater rushing downstream on social media.\n\nNavajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said the tribe had pledged to hold accountable all those who caused or contributed to the spill. He added that he was grateful the federal government acknowledged the devastation that it caused.\n\nWhile New Mexico and the Navajo Nation pursued separate lawsuits, the cases were consolidated and state officials said Thursday that remediation and restoration work will be coordinated.\n\nState officials said a restoration plan will be developed with public input.","labels":[]}

(AP) \u2014 Wisconsin lawmakers agreed Wednesday to settle allegations that two factory farms violated their pollution permits for more than a quarter of a million dollars.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee unanimously approved a $17,500 settlement with North Side Genetics LLC in Fennimore and a $228,000 settlement with Stahl Brothers Dairy LLC. The state Justice Department accused North Side Genetics of failing to construct a feed storage runoff control system by an Aug. 1, 2019, deadline. The department accused Stahl Brothers Dairy of multiple manure-spreading violations.\n\nRepublicans passed a state law in late 2016 that requires the Justice Department to obtain permission from the finance committee before entering into legal settlements. The law was part of a GOP effort to weaken Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul and Gov. Tony Evers before they began their first terms.\n\nThe committee on Wednesday also signed off on a $940,000 settlement with Didion Milling Inc. The Justice Department sued the company in November 2020 alleging inspectors discovered multiple emissions, record-keeping and reporting violations at its Cambria corn mill in 2019. A grain dust explosion at the mill two years earlier killed five employees.\n\n\nLast year, a federal grand jury charged the company with fraud and conspiracy in connection with the explosion, alleging the company failed to keep up with cleanings at the plant and falsified records to make it appear as if the cleanings were completed. The company responded to the charges by insisting the explosion was an accident.\n\nClick here to download the NBC15 News app or our NBC15 First Alert weather app.\n","labels":[]}
{"text":"Poland was the only economy in the European Union to avoid recession during the 2008 global financial crisis. Even in 2009, when the whole EU went into recession, Poland continued to grow at 2.6 percent. Today, Poland\u2019s economy is a quarter larger than at the onset of the crisis, while the economy of the EU as a whole grew by only 0.7 percent (Figure 1).\n\nThis remarkable performance resulted from a number of factors, including timely fiscal and monetary stimulus, a large depreciation of the currency, and a relatively large domestic economy, which limited the country\u2019s exposure to falling international trade. In addition, growth was supported by growing inflows of funds from the European Union, a diversified export structure, and sustained confidence among Polish consumers and entrepreneurs.\n\nPoland\u2019s impressive performance has also been driven by a healthy banking sector. Polish banks remained profitable, liquid, and well-capitalized throughout the crisis. They did not need a single dollar of public support. In contrast to most other EU countries, Poland\u2019s banks managed to increase lending to the private sector during the crisis, supporting the country\u2019s growth.\n\nAn overlooked factor has been the counter-cyclical role of PKO BP\u2014a commercial public bank and the largest player in the Polish market with almost a 20 percent market share\u2014in helping to deal with the crisis.\n\nWhile foreign-owned banks, which controlled almost 75 percent of the banking sector\u2019s assets, were cutting lending in panic, PKO BP was expanding lending at the same time. Its loan portfolio increased by 1.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and represented 40 percent of total new bank lending in that year. The bank\u2019s lending increased for all market segments, including the crucial small and medium-sized enterprise sector.\n\nPKO BP\u2019s positive contribution to Poland\u2019s market liquidity during the global financial crisis contrasts with the often poor performance of other state-owned commercial and development banks around the world, which often suffer from weak corporate governance, misaligned incentives, and unclear mandates. The consensus is that while lending by state-owned banks can sometimes play a useful counter-cyclical role, \u201cthe track record of state banks in credit allocation remains generally unimpressive,\u201d despite a few success stories.\n\nWhat can explain the different behavior of PKO BP and Poland\u2019s foreign-owned banks? Four things:\n\n PKO BP\u2019s decision to expand credit was based on the country\u2019s strong economic fundamentals, while lending decisions of foreign-owned subsidiaries largely followed the risk-averse policies of their international parent banks.\nThe government supported the bank\u2019s rights and new share issue in 2009, which strengthened the bank\u2019s capital base and allowed for expansion of lending.\nPKO BP maintained a conservative funding structure before and during the crisis, which minimized its dependence on the moribund refinancing market. The bank\u2019s domestic deposits fully financed outstanding loans, in contrast to the market average, where loan-to-deposit ratio reached almost 120 percent.\nPKO BP improved its liquidity owing to an outflow of deposits from foreign-owned banks, early repurchase of long-term bonds by the National Bank of Poland, and a reduction in the mandatory reserve.\nPKO BP\u2019s increased lending during the crisis did not undermine the loan quality. The bank\u2019s non-performing loans (NPLs) have increased less than the market average during 2008-2011. In 2011, NPLs amounted to less than 8 percent of the bank\u2019s total assets, below the market average of almost 9 percent. At the end of 2014, the bank\u2019s NPLs amounted to 7.7 percent.\n\nThe case of Poland\u2019s PKO BP suggests that state-controlled banks can indeed play an important counter-cyclical role during crises by supporting lending to the economy. It also highlights the benefits of a diversified bank ownership structure. Foreign banks are likely to play a positive role in supporting financial deepening and mitigating endogenous crises, but domestically owned banks may come in handy when the sector is hit by exogenous crises.\n\nFor state-controlled banks to be successful, however, they need to be professionally managed, commercially oriented, open to free-market competition, and subject to hard budget constraints. Taking state-controlled banks public can help meet some of these conditions. PKO BP\u2019s stock market listing promoted adoption of international accounting standards, reduced political pressures and imposed market discipline. But market discipline alone is not likely to be sufficient; state-controlled banks are likely to perform well in countries with a well embedded culture of transparency, accountability, and responsibility. Achieving these, however, is far from straightforward.\n\nThis blog post reflects the personal views of the author and does not represent the position of the World Bank Group.","labels":[]}
{"text":"For decades, the association of shipping companies that use the port has hired longshore workers from a list supplied by the union \u2014 a list created by asking each union member to provide a single name. But certain candidates appearing on the list are currently children under three years of age\nStriking dockworkers from the Port of Montreal walk the picket line during the first day of a strike in Montreal on Monday, April 26, 2021. A labour arbitrator has accused the dockworkers of giving the names of their family members as future hires at the port. (Paul Chiasson\/The Canadian Press)\n\nSocial Sharing\n\nLabour arbitrator says list amounts to employment discrimination based on family situation\n\nThe union representing dockworkers at the Port of Montreal says it has ended a long-standing hiring practice that has been criticized for fostering nepotism \u2014 to the point where workers' preschool offspring were placed on a list of potential employees.\n\nFor decades, the association of shipping companies that use the port has hired longshore workers from a list supplied by the union \u2014 a list created by asking each union member to provide a single name.\n\nBut the Maritime Employers Association has argued the list is a recipe for nepotism, resulting in few women candidates or members of ethnic minorities, but in some instances children who were barely out of diapers.\n\nIn April, a labour arbitrator ordered a series of changes after finding it was impossible for people to get their names on the list unless they were related to current dockworkers.\n\n\"It appeared that this list contained, almost exclusively, the names of family members of each of the longshore workers, without any verification of merit or the ability of these people to do the job of a longshore worker,'' Nathalie Faucher wrote in her decision, which was first reported by La Presse.\n\nShe found that the list amounted to employment discrimination based on family situation, which is banned under federal human rights law.\n\nIn another decision on the matter last year, Faucher had noted the employer's contention that \"certain candidates appearing on the union's master list are currently children under three years of age.''\n\nSince 2015, 50 per cent of longshore workers have been hired from the union's list \u2014 previously all hires were drawn from the list.\n\nFaucher found that while the process has faced criticism since the early 1980s, previous attempts to change the system resulted in long conflicts. \"Strong measures will have to be taken to break this cycle of systemic discrimination,'' she wrote.\n\nThe Canadian Union of Public Employees-affiliated union had argued no questions were asked about the relationship between the person being added to the list and the member proposing them, so it was unaware of any family links. However, Faucher found those links were often self-evident.\n\nThe union also claimed the association's challenge to the list was an attempt to short-circuit upcoming contract negotiations.\n\nUnion respecting decision\n\nSpokesman Michel Murray said the union is fully respecting the arbitrator's April decision, which ordered it to take more than a dozen steps to make it possible for anyone qualified to get their name on the list. The arbitrator also appointed an independent monitor to ensure her orders were being respected.\n\nMurray said the list goes back decades \"to when active longshore workers were asked by shipping companies to have their family members join the workforce when the Port of Montreal was busy.''\n\nBecause each worker could put only a single name on the list, \"it was not uncommon for minors to be listed, given that it could take several years before the employer issued a call for applications,'' he wrote in an email Tuesday.\n\nThe Maritime Employers Association said it's not questioning the union's prerogative to choose workers \u2014 but the process must comply with human rights law and the collective agreement.\n\n\"We are obviously pleased with the arbitration decision in the nepotism case. Inclusion, equality and accessibility for all are important values for the MEA,'' said Isabelle Pelletier, the association's vice-president of communications and public affairs.\n\n'Times have changed'\n\nJohn Corey, the president of the Freight Management Association of Canada, said that like other publicly traded companies, large shipping companies have to report on diversity and governance in their financial statements.\n\n\"They have an obligation to report on those issues to their shareholders, so it makes it much more difficult for a company to say, we're just going to hire friends and relatives. Times have changed,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nPier-Luc Bilodeau, an industrial relations professor at Universit\u00e9 Laval, said systems in which employers hire candidates selected by unions have existed at other North American ports, as well as for stagehands and in the construction industry, though the practice has been banned in Quebec's construction sector.\n\n\"As a group we want to make sure that the generation after us, our children, can have this opportunity to have good jobs \u2014 that's the logic behind the union's approach,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nWhile the presence of young children on the list may seem shocking, it follows that same logic \u2014 union members don't know when more workers will be needed and want to ensure their children are near the top of the list when they are able to fill jobs at the port.\n\nJean-Claude Bernatchez, a professor of labour relations at the Universit\u00e9 du Quebec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, said the organization of work at the Port of Montreal will likely be one of the central issues as the union begins negotiations with the MEA on Thursday.\n\n\"The unions want to keep the number of jobs they have in Montreal. There's something like 1,400 longshore workers and they want to keep their wages, they want to keep their methods, so they're resistant to change,'' he said.\n\n\"As for the employer, they want to reduce their costs, they want to introduce technology as much as possible to make things more efficient.''","labels":[]}
{"text":"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Tropical Storm Franklin churned through the Caribbean Sea on Monday as authorities in Haiti and the Dominican Republic warned residents to prepare for landslides and heavy floods.\n\nThe storm was centered on Monday night about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, and had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). It remained temporarily stationary, but was forecast to make a sharp turn north on Tuesday.\n\nFranklin was expected to strengthen before making landfall early Wednesday in Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm is forecast to drop up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain in both countries, with up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) in isolated areas. Heavy rainfall is of great concern to Haiti, where severe erosion in many places often leads to dangerous flooding. More than 40 people died in June following a day of heavy rain from a thunderstorm.\n\n\u201cThe mudslide risk there is just awful,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, noting that a slow-moving storm poses great danger in Haiti given that it's so stripped of trees.\n\nRecent Stories from ABC News\nSeveral Haitians in the capital of Port-au-Prince told The Associated Press that they didn't know a tropical storm was coming, despite authorities posting warnings on social media.\n\nMarie Christine Bonjour, 39, who sells used clothes, said she didn't have any preparations in place.\n\n\u201cGod is the only plan. He'll look over me and my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing I can do.\u201d\n\nThe storm approached as more than 200,000 people in Haiti are displaced, having to stay with family or in makeshift shelters because warring gangs pillaged and set fire to their homes.\n\n\u201cI hope God will direct the storm in another direction,\u201d said street vendor Anne Jean-Pierre, 45. \u201cWe can't take any more.\u201d\n\n\nJean-Pierre, who has moved twice already because of gang violence, said she would put her essential documents in a plastic bag because she lives in an area that floods easily.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire southern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A tropical storm watch was iposted for the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nEarlier Monday, there were three tropical storms swirling through the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean, an unusual occurrence as the region braces for a busier than average hurricane season.\n\n\u201cWe went from nothing to a lot in a day,\u201d Klotzbach said.\n\nOne of those storms, Emily, dissipated late Monday morning, and another storm, Gert, was downgraded to a tropical depression late Monday afternoon.\n\nRecent Stories from ABC News\nFranklin formed Sunday and was dropping heavy rain over parts of Puerto Rico on Monday, Gert formed overnight to become the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It formed some three weeks early compared with the dates of the eighth named storms from 1991 to 2020, said Brian McNoldy, senior research associated at University of Miami.\n\nThere have been 14 years with three named storms simultaneously in the Atlantic since 1886, Klotzbach said. The most storms the Atlantic has ever had at one time is four, a phenomena that has occurred only twice, in 1893 and 1995.\n\nThe Atlantic is smaller than the Pacific and can only accommodate so many storms, Klotzbach said, adding that Franklin was shearing apart Gert.\n\n\u201cOne will basically kill the other one,\u201d he said of storms that are too close to each other.\n\nMeanwhile, a fourth system in the Gulf of Mexico was expected to soon become a tropical storm, as was a system off the coast of western Africa.\n\n\n\u201cWe expected an active season,\u201d said Odalis Mart\u00ednez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Puerto Rico. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that we have several active storms.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 10, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration updated its forecast and warned that this year\u2019s hurricane season would be above normal.\n\nBetween 14 to 21 named storms are forecast. Of those, six to 11 could become hurricanes, with two to five of them possibly becoming major hurricanes, the NOAA said.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.","labels":[]}
{"text":"Geopolitics is the motivation behind most international conflicts, as countries seek to advance their strategic interests and protect their national security in a world where power and resources are limited,\u201d Ian Bremmer writes in his 2015 book, Superpower: Three Choices for America\u2019s Role in the World. Be it conflicts over fertile riverbanks, fortified highlands, natural harbors, sacred places, or natural resources, military and political leaders have long understood that control over geography embodies power.\n\nMiddle Eastern history, too, has been repeatedly marked by such struggles over strategic physical features of the natural world. Competition for the waters of the Nile River has continued since the time of Moses all the way to the modern day, with ongoing regional tensions over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Conflicts over key Middle Eastern port cities can be dated at least as far back as the Punic Wars (264-146 BCE) and remain a crucial factor in today\u2019s war in Yemen, with the fight over the port of Hodeida, overlooking the Red Sea. Sacred places have also frequently been at the heart of geography-based conflicts in the region: from the time of Abyssinian ruler Abraha of Aksum\u2019s march on Mecca, to the Crusades, all the way to the present-day Israeli-Palestinian tensions over the al-Aqsa Mosque\/Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\nPut another way, modern history in the Middle East did not significantly alter regional actors\u2019 approaches when it came to the classical physics of conflict. The occupation of Palestine, the Iraq-Iran War, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Second Gulf War, as well as the civil war in Yemen all were or are centered around territorial considerations \u2014 the loss or recovery of land. Escaping that cycle required a shift away from one of the main root causes of conflict: geography.\n\nThe more recently observed trends toward de-escalation in the region became especially perceptible in the Abraham Accords, originally signed by Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates in September 2020. Over the past four decades, Arab states had two main regional enemies: Israel and Iran. The Abraham Accords sought to de-conflict relations with Israel, while the current talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran are an attempt to reach a rapprochement with another arch rival.\n\nThe Abraham Accords, of course, were not the first instance of peace between Israel and an Arab state \u2014 both Egypt and Jordan signed peace agreements with the Israelis years before that. However, the drastic difference between those treaties and the Abraham Accords was the fact that the UAE and Bahrain do not share a border nor have any territorial disputes with Israel. The Abraham Accords, thus, involved no land swap or border security agreement; this, combined with the fact that these three states were not actually involved in a direct conflict, indicated that this was not a classical peace deal.\n\nThe difference between peace based on land and peace without land is like the difference between classical physics and quantum physics. The Abraham Accords were not governed by the dynamic variables of geopolitics but rather by a new set of considerations, which are fast becoming the dominant factors driving current regional approaches to dealing with the Middle East\u2019s chronic conflicts.\n\nThe same approach notably governed the 2021 al-Ula Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit, which reconciled the Saudis and Emiratis with the Qataris, last year\u2019s rapprochement between the UAE and Turkey, and now the ongoing normalization talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia. These examples should not be interpreted as evidence of mere tactical pragmatism based on former British Prime Minister Lord Henry John Temple Palmerstone\u2019s mantra of eternal friends and perpetual enemies; rather, they arguably signify a more profound shift akin to what Theodore Becker described, in a 1991 academic study, as \u201cquantum politics.\u201d\n\nNew principles for Middle Eastern politics\n\nThe current changes in the Middle East, characterized by a significant drive toward de-escalation and a growing willingness to periodically part ways with traditional allies, may be telling symptoms of a more profound tectonic shift. Three operating principles could explain this \u201cquantum\u201d approach to geopolitics in the region.\n\nMoving beyond geography: Geography is no longer the basis for political engagement in the Middle East. The region\u2019s established geopolitical formations, like the GCC or the Council of the Arab and African Countries of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, will continue to be important, but they will not be the only way for regional partnerships and alliances to develop. The most obvious manifestation of this direction is the adoption of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreements (CSPA) and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPA) among countries not joined by geography. The UAE, for example, has developed such partnerships with Germany, China, Russia, Japan, India, Israel, Indonesia, Austria, and Turkey, with further agreements in the works. Notably, although none of these countries share borders with the UAE, the benefits can nonetheless be huge \u2014 as in the partnerships with China and India, which involve technology transfers and food and health security. Bilateral relations not based on geographical proximity will be a major enabler for broader geography-free associations, such as the quadrilateral Israel-India-UAE-United States (I2U2) arrangement, unlocking huge potential for trans-regional cooperation.\nConnectivity and apolarity: Polarity is no longer the operating dynamism in international relations. The concept of an ideological center of gravity that brings several countries together, as was the case with Capitalism and Communism during the Cold War, is no longer the major operating assumption of alliances. Instead, the expansion of the economic cooperation model is bringing different countries with little ideological congruity together. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a notable manifestation of such a connectivity agenda, which may replace polarity as the core of the world order, providing new solutions to old problems. The electricity-for-water deal between Israel and Jordan, and the extension of the GCC electricity grid to Iraq are also examples of how connectivity can reduce geopolitical tensions. The principle of connectivity, by its very nature, dictates a letting go of polarity. In quantum politics, sides are not taken based on ideology, political affiliation, or identity blocs, be they national or religious. On the contrary, a networked world order dictates the ability of each country to develop different areas of connectivity regardless of political differences, even with rivals. The concept of West versus East will soon become an \u201canalogue\u201d system, with roots in colonialism and the Cold War struggle; in quantum politics there is no East and West. The idea of a Global South that is opposite to a Global North also runs counter to this idea of connectivity. Like networks, connectivity thrives on nodes, and the ability to freely exchange goods, money, people, and data. Polarity contravenes such possibilities.\nCooperation as security: The traditional approach to security has always been built on the idea of defense. Walls and soldiers made up the two faces of the security coin, and all national security policies are based on identifying possible foes, assessing threats, and creating measures to prevent or retaliate against them. However, the current attitude in the region is based on cooperation to reduce the possibility of a security threat instead of attempts to prevent an expected attack. This attitude is at the heart of the Iranian-Saudi as well as UAE-Turkish rapprochements, and it is at the core of the Abraham Accords as well. Moreover, interstate cooperation reduces dependencies on non-state actors and minimizes proxy wars. And while arguably such an approach to relations failed in the case of Germany and Russia, the concept has continued to work to reduce tensions between South Korea and China.  \nRegional and global implications\n\nThe above-described shift away from geopolitics will not stay regional, mainly because it is driven by global issues such as climate change, energy, food, and health security, as well as supply chain sustainability concerns.\n\nNotably, this \u201cquantum\u201d approach to politics could help reduce ossified tensions between Israel and Iran, using the bridges built by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. And looking beyond the Middle East region, this shift could even help reduce tension in the geostrategic and heavily militarized South China Sea. New connectivity projects, such as the Blue Economy ocean governance concept or underwater tunnels that will connect Iran with the UAE and Yemen with Djibouti, promise unprecedented economic cooperation capable of pacifying some of the most enduring conflicts in the region. Just like quantum physics, quantum politics is a relatively novel idea and will take much time to understand and apply properly \u2014 but the proof of concept is already at hand.\n","labels":[]}

Shares of Hawaiian Electric are trading below $10.\nIt started collapsing after the Maui wildfires and continues to fall, on Friday facing another downgrade to its credit rating. This, after Maui County on Thursday announced it was suing HECO for negligence in the disaster.\n\nHow might all these lawsuits affect consumers and HECO workers?\n\nEleven lawsuits have been filed against HECO since the fires occurred on Aug. 8, killing at least 115 people.\n\nAttorney Mike Morgan of Morgan & Morgan represents Donnie \"Roxx\" McIntire, who is one of those plaintiffs.\n\n\n\"Our lawsuit is against Hawaiian Electric for failures we believe and allege contributed to and caused this fire, which we believe were forseeable and very preventable,\" Morgan said.\n\nMorgan predicts the number of lawsuits will skyrocket. He explained that a class-action lawsuit is not appropriate here - rather, the filings will be as \"a personal injury case, sometimes called a mass tort, [where] there are multiple people affected by the same event but all affected in a different way. I think at some point we'll see coordination with the courts because there's going to be thousands of lawsuits.

That, too, is still up in the air, but Mangelsdorf says this is a factor.\n\n\"Once the company has greater liabilities than assets, that's when things can get dicey,\" he said.\n\n\nFiling for Chapter 11 bankruptcy would count as dicey, which a number of experts have already predicted, some saying it could happen as soon as October.","labels":[]}
{"text":"Congress and the Biden administration are weighing various legislative and executive actions to ban TikTok, a social media platform with approximately 150 million US users. However, broad restrictions on TikTok or future non-US communication platforms could carry long-term implications for free speech, global data transfers, and US-China relations. Instead of banning TikTok, the United States could benefit from comprehensive rules to address digital privacy, algorithmic profiling, and content moderation across the entire technology ecosystem.\n\nIn March 2023, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reportedly recommended banning or divesting from TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China. This marked the latest sign that US-China relations are on an unmistakable downward trajectory. The bilateral relationship had worsened between 2017 to 2020 for a variety of reasons, including China\u2019s response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detention of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang. Former President Trump was an instigating factor as well; he imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports, popularized controversial rhetoric including the \u201cChina virus,\u201d and even suggested that a TikTok ban was partially motivated by retribution for COVID-19.\n\nWhen President Biden took office in 2021, it was not initially clear whether he would act to either heighten or de-escalate competitive tensions. Towards the beginning of his term, Biden revoked Trump\u2019s 2020 executive order to block the popular social media app in order to assess the stated security risks and adopted more diplomatic language in general. Yet, his administration recently embarked on a series of more hawkish actions, including restricting semiconductors exports to China in October 2022 and doubling down on Trump\u2019s TikTok ban in March 2023. Members of Congress have also introduced a range of bills in 2023, including the RESTRICT Act, DATA Act, and ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act, that aim to empower the executive branch to ban TikTok. In this manner, tensions with China have risen to a \u201ckitchen table issue\u201d: up to 150 million Americans use TikTok and could be directly impacted by a ban, unlike prior restrictions on telecommunications equipment manufacturers, such as Huawei and ZTE.\n\n \n\nThe Goals and Challenges of a TikTok Ban or Divestiture\n\nAny policy towards TikTok warrants a careful cost-benefit analysis, especially since a ban or divestiture of a consumer-facing app of this size is virtually unprecedented in the United States. Because divestiture would likely face significant regulatory and financial hurdles, including Chinese export control laws, US antitrust scrutiny, and broader economic volatility, the reported CFIUS decision could result in a de facto ban. Proponents of an outright ban have expressed concerns that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) might access TikTok\u2019s user data or even control its content recommendation algorithm to target disinformation. While the Biden administration and Congress have not presented any public evidence of such misuse in the past, their position is that the CCP might do so in the future under statutes such as the 2017 National Intelligence Law. TikTok has attempted to reduce these risks through Project Texas: a plan to store Americans\u2019 personal information in the United States, outside the CCP\u2019s jurisdiction, among other safeguards. The Biden administration has not publicly explained why CFIUS abandoned Project Texas negotiations in favor of a ban or divestiture, but a widespread lack of trust amongst Americans regarding independent Chinese-based companies in the United States complicates any middle-ground agreement.\n\nIndiscriminate data collection poses legitimate privacy and national security risks, but banning or divesting TikTok is not an effective solution to address them. US digital platforms face little to no legal requirements to protect personal information or prevent the proliferation of harmful content. As such, from a practical standpoint, these stated risks would persist even if ByteDance sold TikTok to a US company. In fact, numerous US-based mobile apps and data brokers collect enormous amounts of sensitive personal information and transfer it abroad\u2014including to entities within China. Moreover, disinformation is a decentralized problem that stems from many actors on both US and non-US platforms. Some of the most harmful examples actually originated domestically, such as the \u201cBig Lie\u201d that primarily spread on platforms like Parler, Gab, and Fox News leading up to the US Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. In other words, CFIUS and lawmakers are pushing a TikTok-specific solution to address risks that are scattered across the broader technology ecosystem.\n\nAny cost-benefit analysis must also consider the risks of banning TikTok\u2014not just the risks of it continuing to operate in the United States. In the short-term, a ban would primarily impact US TikTok users, not the CCP: it would block a form of speech and creative expression for approximately one-third of Americans and directly harm brand influencers, musicians, and political organizers. In the long-term, precedent with TikTok could encourage other countries to impose similar restrictions on US companies, especially given widespread global distrust of an underregulated US data ecosystem with frequent privacy scandals in both the public and private sectors. When France followed the United States in prohibiting TikTok on government-issued devices in March 2023, it also included US mobile apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Netflix on that list. The Court of Justice of the European Union previously invalidated two EU-US data transfer agreements in its Schrems I (2015) and Schrems II (2020) decisions, demonstrating how ongoing concerns with US government surveillance, too, could threaten to normalize barriers to international data flows.\n\n \n\nMore Holistic Approaches to Digital Privacy and Safety\n\nThese trends are not sustainable. An increasingly walled-off internet would disrupt global commerce, access to information, and communications flows. Legislation like the RESTRICT Act could signal a long-term policy shift towards banning or selling off additional non-US platforms that transfer personal data\u2014which, in a digital age, could broadly encompass numerous commercial and non-profit entities. Rather than engaging in a potentially perilous action of that scope, Congress should instead create legal limitations on how all US companies process and transfer personal information, including to inform automated profiling and content recommendation algorithms. In turn, the Biden administration must improve public transparency on its decision to divest or ban TikTok and allow opportunities for civil society input\u2014especially for an action that could affect millions of Americans. So far, Congress has placed the entire burden on TikTok to prove that it does not pose security risks, but the administration has not provided a classified congressional briefing or public evidence that: (1) TikTok\u2019s data practices are substantially different from its US-based competitors, (2) it poses a tangible enough threat to warrant a drastic measure like a ban, and (3) more targeted solutions such as updated privacy regulations or Project Texas would not sufficiently address the stated issue.\n\nIn recent weeks, several lawmakers have acknowledged that concerns over TikTok\u2019s data collection and algorithmic targeting reflect systemic under regulation across the US digital sector, and have called for comprehensive legislation like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act to set boundaries on how all businesses process, transfer, and store personal information. Despite this recognition, there are a few possible strategic calculations behind the recent momentum to ban just TikTok. First, there is the idea of reciprocity: since China has blocked US companies like Google and Facebook, some might argue that the United States is justified in banning TikTok. After all, the biggest beneficiaries of a TikTok ban would be its US competitors\u2014Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, all of whom engage in comparable data collection and content recommendation tactics. In addition, some contend that banning TikTok could prevent the CCP from accessing social media data to train facial recognition algorithms, thus strengthening the US technological advantage in artificial intelligence development, even though most user-uploaded videos and images are public anyways. In this manner, some lawmakers might see a TikTok ban as an offensive approach\u2014not just a defensive one.\n\nHowever, this form of economic protectionism is short sighted. It is a product of increasingly hawkish attitudes among US lawmakers, based on a notion of fundamental differences in democratic and authoritarian principles. If the United States takes similar steps to China, it risks undermining its own message. China has already been criticized by much of the world for its \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d and the United States\u2019 global image could similarly suffer if it also resorts to banning large chunks of the internet primarily based on country of origin. Nor should the United States, with a long tradition of free speech, head down the CCP\u2019s path of censoring communications from up to 150 million Americans to address unproven fears that a small fraction of those accounts may express ideas associated with a government it does not like.\n\nDuring a hearing on March 23, House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) told TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew: \u201cWe do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values.\u201d But what exactly do American values consist of in a widely polarized nation? During the hearing, legislators blamed TikTok for a range of issues from harming mental health to allowing drug-related content\u2014thereby conflating problems that are specific to TikTok and those that are broader societal issues. In one ironic example, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL), who is a board member of the Alachua County Friends of the National Rifle Association, lambasted Chew during the hearing over a user-uploaded video that contained a cartoon gun. But TikTok, like other social media platforms, does not create societal problems; it reflects and amplifies existing domestic trends. That is why the best way to counter foreign influence in the long-term is not to outright ban TikTok or future communications channels\u2014it is to promote democratic values like free expression, individual privacy, and social justice in both the online and offline spaces at home.\n","labels":[]}
{"text":"The European Commission finally delivered its long-anticipated oral report on Ukraine\u2019s progress last month, looking at the headway made toward the seven reforms the country will need to pass if European Union leaders are to green-light opening accession negotiations with Kyiv.\n\nOn reforms relating to the judiciary, Kyiv received a broadly positive assessment, albeit more needs to be done. And the same goes for tackling vested interests in the media as well. On the prevention of money laundering, the fight against corruption, reducing the influence of oligarchs and the protection of minorities, however, Ukraine still has a lot more to do, and it will now have until the fall to demonstrate further progress before European capitals consider a fuller written assessment.\n\nWhat was crucially missing from this initial analysis, though, was the EU\u2019s own preparedness for admitting Ukraine, whether in 10, 15 or 20 years\u2019 time. This is arguably the bigger, more important consideration \u2014 especially as many in Berlin, Paris and Brussels expect the Western Balkans \u2014 as well as Moldova and possibly Georgia \u2014 to join the bloc at the same time. Leaders will therefore have to be satisfied that the EU won\u2019t collapse under its own weight if they are to move Ukraine\u2019s enlargement process forward at their December gathering in Brussels.\n\nAn initial discussion on the implications for the EU if Ukraine were to eventually join the bloc \u2014 or, what in jargon is now referred to as the EU\u2019s \u201cabsorption capacity\u201d \u2014 will thus be held by leaders in Granada in early October. And the two most important dimensions of this debate relate to governance and the EU budget.\n\nGovernance concerns the EU\u2019s ability to function, pass laws and take decisions if the number of members jumps from 27 nations to 35 or 36, given that many policy areas operate by unanimity.\n\nHungary\u2019s use of its veto \u2014 now seen by many in Brussels as an extension of its domestic and foreign policy \u2014 has focused minds in EU capitals on the risk of paralysis unless the bloc streamlines its decision-making process.\n\nFor some, the favored solution for addressing this problem is more qualified majority voting, stripping countries of their veto. Germany and France are already championing this move in foreign and tax policy. However, they face stiff opposition from Hungary, Poland and several countries that want to preserve their sovereignty by maintaining the condition of unanimity.\n\nOne possible way out of this impasse could be a compromise that sees more qualified majority voting, say in foreign affairs, but with \u201csafeguards\u201d in place. So, there would be an understanding in the Council that member countries wouldn\u2019t go against each other\u2019s core national interests. In the case of Greece, for example, Turkey-related issues would be considered a core interest. But this debate still has a very long course to run.\n\nThe question of EU budget funds is equally profound.\n\nCurrently, the largest outflows from Brussels to member countries are cohesion funds for economic convergence and agricultural subsidies under the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Together they make up roughly two-thirds of the budget.\n\nBut for now, there\u2019s still no agreement on the budgetary implications of Ukraine joining the bloc. Senior German officials who have studied the numbers suggest all EU countries that currently benefit from the budget would become net contributors to it. Other EU capitals argue the financial flows would essentially remain status quo \u2014 but that seems unlikely.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission is yet to produce its own analysis on the question.\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that the \u201cUkraine question\u201d will be the single biggest political priority of the new Commission that will take office in November next year | Dominique Faget\/AFP via Getty Images\nHowever, as Ukraine is poorer and more agrarian than the average EU member country, its membership will lead to it receiving a large amount of cohesion and agricultural funds from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThis then raises the question of whether the EU budget will need to be increased \u2014 perhaps by more supranational taxes or via contributions from member countries \u2014 or be completely rewired.\n\nAs the budget\u2019s recent difficult midterm review \u2014 the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) \u2014 demonstrated, the bloc is already struggling to reprioritize money within its existing framework for new geopolitical priorities. And that could help create impetus for reform, as there is already an emerging consensus in Brussels that the EU budget is no longer fit for purpose.\n\nAlthough Ukraine is unlikely to join the EU before the next 10 years \u2014 and it may even take longer than that \u2014 the next MFF will still need to provision for the country\u2019s possible entry, as it will run from 2028 to 2034. This means leaders will already have to engage with these issues in the next few years.\n\nAlong these lines, the recently proposed \u20ac50 billion Ukraine facility is seen by many in Brussels as the basis for how the next MFF might address the country\u2019s accession. Rather than a toxic political debate over the winners and losers of EU budget funds, some officials are contemplating a facility that would sit alongside but be distinctive from the regular budget. Another idea is to adopt two MFF\u2019s \u2014 one for the 27 members and another for an enlarged EU, which would only be activated at the moment of accession. This is what happened in 2000, before countries in Central and Eastern Europe joined in 2004. But again, none of this will be easy to agree on.\n\nHow these reforms are implemented to make the EU \u201cUkraine-ready\u201d is also open to debate.\n\nSome in Brussels take the view that the institutional changes discussed above could be managed within the parameters of the Lisbon Treaty, while other officials say a \u201cconvention\u201d between all member countries (and Ukraine) would be necessary \u2014 like the process that gave birth to the Lisbon Treaty. Referenda may also be needed in several countries like France, although this could be legally avoided if both of France\u2019s parliamentary chambers supported the decision to admit Ukraine with a 3-to-5 majority. However, politically, it\u2019s difficult to see a referendum being avoided.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s also entirely possible that the entire enlargement process may be rethought to enable Ukraine\u2019s membership.\n\n\nRather than have Ukraine and other countries in the Western Balkans join all at once in 10, 15 or 20 years, their integration could happen in stages. Senior EU officials talk about a model whereby Ukraine would close certain chapters and then acquire the right to participate in specific Council formations \u2014 to shape but not take EU decisions \u2014 while benefiting from certain EU budget instruments and programs.\n\nThis would enable the EU to reform incrementally, helping to detoxify debate over the end date. But some countries, like Germany, oppose this approach, arguing that if member countries preserve their vetoes while candidate countries are integrated into the EU, they will never be allowed to fully join. This approach is also forbidden by the treaty.\n\nSome officials see a role here for the European Political Community, the new platform French President Emmanuel Macron created to allow the EU to engage with its wider neighborhood.\n\nWhile all this work has just begun, it\u2019s now clear that the \u201cUkraine question\u201d will be the single biggest political priority of the new Commission that will take office in November next year. And there\u2019s no doubt it will dominate politics in Brussels and other EU capitals for years to come.","labels":[]}

{"text":"Company Moves Forward Toward Intended Separation into Industry-Leading, Publicly Traded Companies in Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products; Separations Expected to Occur Within 18 Months\n\nMIDLAND, Mich., and WILMINGTON, Del. - September 01, 2017 - DowDuPont\u2122 (NYSE:DWDP) today announced the successful completion of the merger of equals between The Dow Chemical Company (\u201cDow\u201d) and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (\u201cDuPont\u201d), effective Aug. 31, 2017. The combined entity is operating as a holding company under the name \u201cDowDuPont\u2122\u201d with three divisions \u2013 Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products.\n\nShares of DuPont and Dow ceased trading at the close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Aug. 31, 2017. Beginning today, DowDuPont will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker symbol \u201cDWDP.\u201d Pursuant to the merger agreement, Dow shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 1.00 share of DowDuPont for each Dow share, and DuPont shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 1.282 shares of DowDuPont for each DuPont share.\n\n\u201cToday marks a significant milestone in the storied histories of our two companies,\u201d said Andrew Liveris, executive chairman of DowDuPont. \u201cWe are extremely excited to complete this transformational merger and move forward to create three intended industry-leading, independent, publicly traded companies. While our collective heritage and strength are impressive, the true value of this merger lies in the intended creation of three industry powerhouses that will define their markets and drive growth for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our teams have been working for more than a year on integration planning, and -- as of today -- we will hit the ground running on executing those plans with an intention to complete the separations as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor shareholders, customers and employees, closing this transaction is a definitive step toward unlocking higher value and greater opportunities through a future built on sustainable growth and innovation,\u201d said Ed Breen, chief executive officer of DowDuPont. \u201cDowDuPont is a launching pad for three intended strong companies that will be better positioned to reinvest in science and innovation, solve our customers\u2019 ever-evolving challenges, and generate long-term returns for our shareholders. With the merger now complete, our focus is on finalizing the organizational structures that will be the foundations of these three intended strong companies and capturing the synergies to unlock value. With clear focus, market visibility and more productive R&D, each intended company will be equipped to compete successfully as an industry leader.\u201d\n\nBoard and Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors of DowDuPont comprises 16 members \u2013 eight directors formerly on the DuPont Board and eight directors formerly on the Dow Board. There are two lead directors: Jeffrey Fettig, who previously served as the lead independent director for Dow; and Alexander Cutler, who previously served as the lead independent director for DuPont. Liveris serves as the executive chairman of the Board and Breen also serves on the Board. Other Board members include:\n\nFrom Dow:\n\nJames A. Bell, Former Chief Financial Officer, Boeing\nRaymond J. Milchovich, Former Chairman and CEO, Foster Wheeler AG\nPaul Polman, CEO, Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V.\nDennis H. Reilley, Non-Executive Chairman, Marathon Oil Corp.\nJames M. Ringler, Chairman, Teradata Corporation\nRuth G. Shaw, Former Group Executive, Public Policy and President, Duke Nuclear\nFrom DuPont:\n\nLamberto Andreotti, Former Chair of the Board and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\nRobert A. Brown, President of Boston University\nMarillyn A. Hewson, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Lockheed Martin Corporation\nLois D. Juliber, Former Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Colgate-Palmolive Company\nLee M. Thomas, Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rayonier Inc.\nPatrick J. Ward, Chief Financial Officer of Cummins, Inc.\nThree Advisory Committees have been established by the DowDuPont Board, chartered to generally oversee the establishment of each of the Agriculture, Materials Science (Dow) and Specialty Products divisions in preparation for the separations. Additionally, each Advisory Committee will develop a capital structure in accordance with the guiding principles set forth in the Bylaws, and designate the future chief executive officer and leadership team of its respective intended company.\n\nDowDuPont Officers\n\nAs previously announced, DowDuPont will be led by a proven leadership team that reflects the strengths and capabilities of both companies. Along with Liveris and Breen, it includes the following executives:\n\nHoward Ungerleider, Chief Financial Officer\nStacy Fox, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\nCharles J. Kalil, Special Counsellor to the Executive Chairman, General Counsel for the Materials Science Division\nJames C. Collins, Jr., Chief Operating Officer for the Agriculture Division\nJim Fitterling, Chief Operating Officer for the Materials Science Division\nMarc Doyle, Chief Operating Officer for the Specialty Products Division\nUnlocking Value for All Stakeholders\n\nBy merging the highly complementary portfolios of Dow and DuPont and subsequently creating intended industry leaders, DowDuPont expects to maximize value for all its stakeholders.\n\nShareholders are expected to benefit from the stronger, focused investment profile of each intended company and substantial cost synergies, as well as from long-term growth and sustainable value creation following the intended separations into three independent companies. The transaction is expected to result in run-rate cost synergies of approximately $3 billion and the potential for approximately $1 billion in growth synergies. The company expects to reach 100 percent run rate on the cost synergies within the first 24 months of merger closing.\nCustomers will benefit from superior solutions and expanded product offerings. By combining the complementary strengths of Dow and DuPont, each intended company will be able to respond faster and more effectively to rapidly changing conditions with innovative products and greater choice.\nEmployees will benefit from being part of these intended highly focused and competitive industry-leaders, built for sustainable, long-term growth \u2013 which will create opportunities for our businesses and opportunities for our people.\nPaths to Separation\n\nDow and DuPont leaders and integration teams are developing the future state operating models and organizational designs that will support the refined strategy of each intended company. Once each division has its own processes, people, assets, systems and licenses in place to operate independently from the parent company, DowDuPont intends to separate the divisions to stand within their own legal entities, subject to Board approval and any regulatory approvals. The intended separations are expected to occur within 18 months.\n\nA leading Agriculture Company that brings together the strengths of DuPont Pioneer, DuPont Crop Protection and Dow AgroSciences to better serve growers around the world with a superior portfolio of solutions, greater choice and competitive price for value.

{"text":"For decades, the petroleum industry in South America has been dogged by one environmental catastrophe after another. Oil spills, flaring and other environmentally damaging incidents are commonplace and have been so for years. This has weighed heavily on the petroleum industry\u2019s social license in many countries with it seemingly locked in an ever-present state of crisis in Ecuador and Peru. It is the near failure of the Venezuelan state and collapse of PDVSA\u2019s petroleum infrastructure which has sparked an environmental catastrophe in that country. While those countries garner the lions share of attention concerning environmental damage caused by industry operations the hydrocarbon sector in Colombia is among the continent\u2019s worst perpetrators.\n\nFor decades Colombia\u2019s national government in Bogota has held out the Andean country's oil industry as a model of success. Despite Colombia possessing meagre proven reserves, totaling 1.8 billion barrels at the end of 2021 with a 6-year production life, the country punches above its weight when it comes to production volumes. For September 2022, Colombia\u2019s average daily oil output was 753,584 barrels per day. While that is far less then the one million barrels per day pumped during 2013 and 2015 it is still significantly higher than neighboring countries like Ecuador that possess larger oil reserves. Data from Colombia\u2019s regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH \u2013 Spanish initials) shows there are 447 various oil contracts assigned to energy companies with 233 production contracts currently active with the remainder being at the exploration stage or in a few instances for special projects and technical evaluation. Those numbers illustrate the size of Colombia\u2019s hydrocarbon sector and why the country punches well above its weight when its scant oil reserves are considered.\n\nThe rapid growth of Colombia\u2019s petroleum industry over the last three decades saw oil become a key economic driver, with it responsible for a third of exports by value, 3% of gross domestic product and around a fifth of government revenue. For those reasons, the Andean country despite its paltry reserves is highly dependent on its domestic petroleum industry. While Bogota has been quick to point to the hydrocarbon sector\u2019s successes, historically Colombia\u2019s national government has been less than forthcoming when it comes to disclosing the environmental and social damage the sector causes.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the number of oil spills that occur in Colombia. An investigation by Mongabay, a nonprofit environmental news platform, found that a Colombian government database shows there more than 2,133 environmentally damaging incidents involving the country\u2019s oil industry between 2015 and 2022. That number, which has been difficult to verify because of a lack of government transparency, is particularly startling because Peru, which is garnering considerable international attention for the environmental damage caused by its oil industry, has experienced a far lower incidence of such events. According to a 2022 report by Oxfam and Peru\u2019s National Coordinator for Human Rights (CNDDHH \u2013 Spanish initials) there were only 1,002 oil spills in Peru from 1997 until 2021. That is less than half the incidences which have purportedly occurred in Colombia over a far shorter period, although a lack of transparency makes it extremely difficult to verify the data. Colombian social and economic thinktank CrudoTransparente counted 54 oil spills from 2017 to 2021, but there is little other hard data available. This lack of transparency in a country where censorship of the media and the murder of environmental defenders is not surprising. There have been many allegations of collusion between the government, oil companies in Colombia and paramilitary groups, notably the Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC \u2013 Spanish initials) which officially disbanded in 2006. The various self defense groups that appeared in Colombia that eventually coalesced to form the AUC, which was a U.S. designated terrorist group, evolved from a nexus between business leaders, the Medellin Cartel and civil patrols established by Colombian authorities. While the AUC has disbanded, various neo-paramilitary bands, tracing their origin to that illegal armed group, have emerged. Aside from their involvement in coca cropping and cocaine trafficking they are believed to be heavily involved in intimidating as well as murdering defending environmental defenders with 322 executed over the last decade.\n\nThe number one offender for oil spills in Colombia is the country\u2019s largest hydrocarbon producer, only refiner and owner of the Andean country\u2019s pipelines national petroleum company Ecopetrol. The data reviewed by Mongabay showed that Colombia\u2019s national oil company was responsible for 67% of the environmental incidents, including oil spills, analyzed. Oil spills that occur in Colombia are not only the fault of energy companies operating in the country and caused by poor maintenance, operational failures or human error, in many cases they are the consequence of sabotage and petroleum theft. Sabotage of oil pipelines and assaults on oilfields by illegal armed groups have long been a significant problem in Colombia. Leftist guerillas the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC \u2013 Spanish initials), which demobilized in 2017, and the National Liberation Army (ELN \u2013 Spanish initials) regarded Colombia\u2019s petroleum industry as a legitimate target in their armed struggle against the state. The extortion of petroleum companies through threats of sabotage, kidnapping of key employees and hijacking of trucks carrying crude as well as supplies became a substantial source of income for the FARC and ELN during the 1990s. \nWhile the volume of attacks on industry infrastructure, primarily oil pipelines, which were a key cause of oil spills have diminished considerably since the FARC struck a 2016 peace agreement with Bogota the volume of oil theft is rising sharply. Soaring cocaine production, significantly higher fossil fuel prices and a crackdown by Colombian authorities on fuel smuggling have forced those illegal armed groups manufacturing cocaine to find an alternate cost-effective supply of gasoline. The oil stolen is shipped to primitive clandestine jungle refineries where it is processed into a very crude form of gasoline known as pategrillo or cricket-foot in English, because of its cloudy green color. Illicit demand for gasoline is soaring because it takes extremely substantial amounts, estimated to be 74 gallons to 86 gallons, of the fuel to process enough coca leaves to produce one kilogram of cocaine. It is coca leaves that contain the crucial alkaloid which forms the base of cocaine and must be soaked in gasoline for it be extracted eventually producing a white paste usually around 40% pure.\n\nColombia\u2019s cocaine production keeps soaring higher, reaching yet another record for 2021 when an estimated 1,400 metric tons was produced representing a 14% increase over the record set a year earlier. As cocaine production grows, fossil fuel prices rise and it becomes increasingly difficult for criminal groups to obtain the copious quantities of gasoline because of monitoring by Colombian authorities the volume of petroleum theft will keep rising. When the crude oil is shipped to a clandestine refinery it is estimated that typically only around 30% to 40% of the petroleum will be processed with the remainder discarded into the surrounding environment. It is for these reasons that oil theft in Colombia is spiraling ever higher. According to data from Colombia\u2019s National Police, obtained by Reuters, the volume of petroleum being stolen has tripled from 2018 to be an estimated 3,447 barrels per day. \n\nOil spills and other industry related environmentally damaging incidents are a constant hazard for Colombia\u2019s oil industry. When they occur, they have a disproportionate impact on Colombia\u2019s Indigenous and poor communities with much of the hydrocarbon sector operating in rural regions. The volume of damage is startling, especially when it is considered that Colombia is ranked as the third most biodiverse country globally, after Indonesia and Brazil. A lack of government and regulatory transparency makes it difficult to track the frequency of incidents, volume of spills and resulting environmental damage. It is for these reasons that the social license for Colombia\u2019s petroleum industry is deteriorating and significant opposition to the controversial hydrocarbon extraction technique of hydraulic fracturing exists.\n\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"Amazon plans to lay off 9,000 corporate and tech workers by the end of April, adding to the 18,000 roles it already cut late last year and this January, Andy Jassy, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a note to employees on Monday.\n\nThe new layoffs, which amount to less than 3 percent of its corporate work force, will target workers in some of Amazon\u2019s most profitable divisions, which had previously been spared, including Amazon\u2019s cloud computing business and advertising operations. Those two segments of the business are much higher-margin operations than Amazon\u2019s core retail business, according to financial analysts and filings.\n\nMr. Jassy wrote that the annual planning session that the company\u2019s leaders wrapped up last week had focused on streamlining costs and head count.\n\n\u201cThe overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers\u2019 lives and Amazon as a whole,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFor more than a year, Mr. Jassy has been pursuing cost cuts at Amazon. The company rapidly added employees during the pandemic and put a priority on some projects that lacked obvious ways to become profitable. He has pulled back on expansion of the company\u2019s warehouse operations, and paused work on the largest phase of Amazon\u2019s planned second headquarters near Washington, D.C.\n\nInside the World of Big Tech\nTikTok: TikTok was fined roughly $370 million by E.U. regulators for having weak safeguards to protect the personal information of children using the platform, a sign of increased scrutiny facing the social media service.\nApple: At an age in which most consumer devices have lost some of their appeal to users, the company has remarkably increased its share of smartphone sales over less expensive rivals.\nGoogle Antitrust Trial: The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case against the tech giant is the greatest legal threat the company has ever faced. Google hopes the stolid approach of its top lawyer will once again prevail.\nFacial Recognition Technology: Engineers at Facebook and Google built tools years ago that could put a name to any face. But for once, Silicon Valley did not want to move fast and break things.\nThe company froze hiring last fall and by November had plans to lay off about 10,000 employees, a target that expanded to 18,000 in early January.\n\nAmazon had about 380,000 corporate employees at the end of 2022, according to a person familiar with its work force.\n\nMost of Amazon\u2019s roughly 1.5 million employees are hourly workers who power its warehouse operations.\n\nThe tech industry is undergoing its largest contraction since the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Nearly every major tech company has laid off workers. Last week Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced plans to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, part of what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called a \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d It had already laid off 11,000 workers late last year.\n\nAt Amazon, last year the initial layoffs affected employees working on the Alexa voice assistant and devices, then they spread to other divisions, including teams working on plans for automated stores, drones and the company\u2019s broader consumer retail business. Human resources employees \u2014 recruiters in particular \u2014 were affected as well.\n\nIn the latest quarter, which ended in December, Amazon reported almost no profit, driven in part by unexpected weakness in its cloud computing business.\n\nTwitch, the livestreaming site popular with video gamers that Amazon bought in 2014, said it was laying off more than 400 people, about 22 percent of its total staff. In the uncertain economy, \u201cuser and revenue growth has not kept pace with our expectations,\u201d Dan Clancy, Twitch\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post. Mr. Clancy took over as chief executive from Twitch\u2019s longtime leader, Emmett Shear, last week.\n\nAmazon\u2019s share price was down a little more than 1 percent at the close of trading on Monday.\n\nMr. Jassy said that management had not yet determined the workers who would be laid off, but that it expected to do so by mid to late April. He said the company could still pursue some \u201climited hiring\u201d in strategic areas.\n\nKellen Browning contributed reporting from San Francisco\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"No one wants a hurricane to make landfall. Among nature\u2019s most damaging events, hurricanes that hit land in the United States usually cause death, destruction and misery. They can also cause havoc to supply chains. \n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina was a 100,000-truckload event, requiring one of the largest relief and recovery supply deployments in U.S. history. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey prompted one of the greatest truck capacity crunches in recent history. \n\nHurricane Lee could cause massive supply chain disruptions if it lands in the United States\nHurricane Lee, which strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane on Wednesday, will likely become a major hurricane by Friday and a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150 mph by Saturday.\n\nLee is now in the Atlantic Ocean well east of any land. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects Lee to intensify quickly and become an extremely dangerous major hurricane. At this time, it is too early to know if Lee will hit any of the major Caribbean islands or the United States.\n\nHowever, if Lee \u2014 or any major hurricane \u2014 did make landfall near a major city, it could cause massive capacity disruptions for U.S. shippers just prior to the peak season run-up.\n\nIf a major hurricane is forecast to make landfall, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state-level agencies will soak up every available truck in the market for relief activities. \n\n\n\nShippers will face much higher freight rates. Shippers would be wise to lock in secure commitments (even at higher contract rates) for a potentially chaotic fourth quarter. At worst, they may be left without trucks to haul goods.\n\nHurricanes create massive demand surges. Rates that shippers locked in to carriers anticipating a slow second half may not work in a tight capacity environment. Many carriers will chase the higher-paying FEMA freight, often ditching shippers that they view as cheap or undesirable.\n\nFor shippers unsure about what to pay in the market, they could resort to high-frequency freight rate benchmarking tools, such as SONAR, or the implementation of index-linked contracts. \n\nImpact on infrastructure\nDepending on where a hurricane hits and its subsequent path over land, a variety of infrastructure can be impacted. Seaports in the path of a hurricane close and may take time to reopen, particularly if there is any damage. The same is true for airports, rail yards and track and certainly bridges and highways. \n\nSome hurricanes have done significant damage to key infrastructure, while others have done very little damage. \n\nRegardless, these storms usually impact key parts of a state\u2019s or region\u2019s infrastructure, if only in the sense of delays. Supply chains break down because of hurricanes; sometimes they are back up and running quickly, while at other times they can be subject to significant delays. \n\n\nHurricane relief efforts\nYears before founding FreightWaves, I ran Xpress Direct from 2002 to 2005. Xpress Direct was the on-demand emergency unit of U.S. Xpress. Over the course of four years dealing with hurricane activity, Xpress Direct handled in excess of 20,000 shipments and billed over $100 million in revenue in disaster-relief loads alone.\n\nHurricane-relief loads offer an opportunity for trucking companies to demonstrate to the public how critical trucking is, regardless of how challenging a mission might be. \n\nHurricane relief is the biggest dog-and-pony show you will ever see in trucking. But there is a certain satisfaction in being able to help people who are suffering.\n\nFreightWaves\u2019 ongoing coverage\nSince FreightWaves.com went online in 2017, it has covered the impact to the nation\u2019s transportation and supply chain of all the hurricanes that have hit the United States. \n\nFreightWaves will cover Hurricane Lee\u2019s path, preparations to deal with it and more \u2014 and will continue to do so through any major relief efforts.

{"text":"The husband of a congresswoman from Alaska died in a plane crash this week \u2014 one of numerous aviation crashes that have given the state the highest rate of plane crashes in the nation.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nEugene \"Buzzy\" Peltola Jr., who was married to Alaska Congresswoman Mary Peltola, died this week after a small airplane he was piloting crashed in the western part of the state. Alaskan members of Congress and family members have been involved in plane accidents before. The state lags behind the rest of the country when it comes to aviation safety. Alaska Public Media's Liz Ruskin has more.\n\nLIZ RUSKIN, BYLINE: Eugene Peltola Jr. was alone in a Piper Super Cub that crashed on departure from a moose hunting camp near the Yukon River. He died before a rescue aircraft arrived.\n\nJENNIFER HOMENDY: It's a very remote, mountainous location. That's all the information I can provide at this time.\n\nRUSKIN: National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy gave a preliminary briefing on Wednesday. She said the cause of the crash is still unknown, and NTSB is investigating it. For Alaskans, a crash like this triggers grim memories.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens was killed in a plane crash in the state he long represented.\n\nRUSKIN: That was in 2010. Stevens' wife, Ann, died in a 1978 plane crash. And in 1972, a plane carrying Alaska's then-Congressman Nick Begich and House Majority Leader Hale Boggs disappeared and is presumed to have crashed. It's not just politicians. Alaskans have to fly a lot. Many don't live on the state's minuscule road system. According to the Air Safety Institute, Alaska's fatality rate per hours flown in small private aircraft used to be twice as high as elsewhere. Despite a dramatic improvement since 2016, it's still higher than the national average. Same for small commercial aircraft.\n\nCOLLEEN MONDOR: We die a little bit at a time - one here, two there, three there.\n\nRUSKIN: That's Colleen Mondor, a Fairbanks pilot and aviation writer with encyclopedic knowledge of Alaska's plane accidents. She thinks it's too easy for people to dismiss Alaska plane crashes because each one has only a few fatalities.\n\nMONDOR: Every now and again, there's a big one, a midair that breaks through to international news. But mostly we die like this, one or two or three at a time. It just gets lost.\n\nRUSKIN: She's sick of seeing the cause shrugged off as Alaska's bad weather.\n\nMONDOR: It's not the weather, OK? It's not that, oh, my God, that weather was so bad. It's what was the information provided on the weather?\n\nRUSKIN: The real problem, she and other aviation experts say, is that Alaska hasn't had enough safety infrastructure like paved runways, statewide communications coverage and - one of the most critical - weather reporting equipment. In Alaska, the FAA and the National Weather Service manage about 140 automated weather stations that provide crucial information to pilots. Tom George, Alaska manager for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, says that's not nearly enough.\n\nTOM GEORGE: We'd have to get about 180 more stations in Alaska to have the same average density that the rest of the country enjoys.\n\nRUSKIN: In an emailed statement, the FAA said that in recent years they've added new weather stations and that improving aviation safety in Alaska is one of their top priorities. In July, the U.S. House passed an FAA reform bill that would, among other things, call for more weather equipment to be deployed in Alaska. It's pending a vote in the Senate.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Liz Ruskin.","labels":[]}

{"text":"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russia kept one of its main gas supply routes to Europe shut on Saturday, stoking fears of winter fuel shortages and spotlighting differences between Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and Germany's Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) over repair work on the pipeline.\n\nAlready struggling to tame soaring gas prices, European governments had expected the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to resume flows after a short maintenance this week but Russia abruptly cancelled the restart, citing an oil leak in a turbine.\n\nEurope has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in what Moscow has called an \"economic war\" with the West over the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions.\n\nThe latest Nord Stream shutdown, which Russia says will last for as long as it takes to carry out repairs, added to fears of winter gas shortages that could help tip major economies into recession and energy rationing.\n\nThe discovery of the oil leak on Friday coincided with the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies proceeding with plans to impose a price gap on Russian oil, intending to shrink President Vladimir Putin's resources to fight the war in Ukraine.\n\nGas shortages also prompted European Union member Sweden on Saturday to unveil a financial support package for energy firms.\n\n\"If we do not act, there is a serious risk of disruptions in the financial system, which in the worst case could lead to a financial crisis,\" said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.\n\n\"Putin wants to create division, but our message is clear: you will not succeed,\" she said.\n\nGAS PRICE RALLY EXPECTED\nGazprom said Siemens Energy was ready to carry out repairs on the pipeline but that there was nowhere available to carry out the work, a suggestion Siemens Energy denied, saying it had not been asked to do the job.\n\nSiemens Energy has also said that sanctions do not prohibit maintenance.\n\nBefore the latest round of maintenance, Gazprom had already cut flows to just 20% of the pipeline's capacity.\n\n\"Siemens is taking part in repair work in accordance with the current contract, is detecting malfunctions ... and is ready to fix the oil leaks. Only there is nowhere to do the repair,\" Gazprom said in a statement on its Telegram channel on Saturday.\n\nSiemens Energy said it had not been commissioned to carry out the work but was available, adding that the Gazprom-reported leak would not usually affect the operation of a turbine and could be sealed on site.\n\n\"Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several times that there are enough additional turbines available in the Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nFlows through Nord Stream 1 were due to resume early on Saturday morning. But hours before it was set to start pumping gas, Gazprom published a photo on Friday of what it said was an oil leak on a piece of equipment.\n\nSiemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment at Nord Stream 1's Portovaya compressor station said on Friday the leak did not constitute a technical reason to stop gas flows.\n\n\n\"Global natural gas prices will likely rally hard on Monday as markets readjust to this latest #Gazprom development,\" Tom Marzec-Manser, Head of Gas Analytics at ICIS, said on twitter.\n\n\"The closure of #NordStream1 reduces overall Russian pipeline flows yet further and will make balancing supply & demand this winter all the more difficult.\"\n\nAsked about the halt on Saturday, Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said that the European Union expects Russia to respect its agreed energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if Moscow fails to do so. read more\n\nThe German network regulator said that the country's gas supply was currently guaranteed but the situation was fragile and further deterioration could not be ruled out.\n\n\"The defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the halt of operations,\" it said.\n\nWholesale gas prices have rocketed more than 400% since August 2021, squeezing households already gripped by a cost-of-living crisis and forcing some energy hungry industries, such as fertiliser and aluminium makers, to scale back production.\n\nThe European Commission has said a full cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Europe, if combined with a cold winter, could reduce average EU gross domestic product by up to 1.5% if countries did not prepare in advance.","labels":[]}
{"text":"Shares of Snowflake (SNOW) got a boost in aftermarket trading Wednesday after reporting second-quarter earnings that easily topped analyst expectations. But SNOW stock gave those gains back and ended up in the red Thursday.\n\nFor the period ended July 31, the cloud-data platform provider reported adjusted earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $674 million. The revenue marked a 36% increase from the $497 million in sales for the same period last year.\n\nSNOW stock analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of 10 cents per share on a 33% yearly sales rise, to $662 million.\n\nAlso, Snowflake officials reiterated their sales outlook for the rest of the company's fiscal 2024, which ends in January. The firm expects $2.6 billion in sales for the year, representing 34% year-over-year growth. But that outlook fell short of the $2.76 billion expected from analysts polled by FactSet ahead of Wednesday's earnings.\n\nSNOW shares took a hit in May when the company lowered its outlook for the year prior to first-quarter earnings. The company predicted 44% to 45% sales growth.\n\n\nPotential AI Boost?\nSNOW stock sank 5.2% to close at 147.67 on the stock market today.\n\nSnowflake reported its quarterly results as most eyes in the investor world were trained on the earnings report of chipmaker and artificial intelligence leader Nvidia (NVDA). Company officials said Snowflake also can benefit from the AI boom.\n\n\"Snowflake as the global epicenter of trusted enterprise data is well positioned to enable the growing interest in AI\/[machine learning],\" Snowflake Chairman and Chief Executive Frank Slootman said in written remarks. \"Enterprises and institutions alike are increasingly aware they cannot have an AI strategy without a data strategy.\"\n\nSnowflake announced in June that it was partnering with Nvidia to build custom large language models for AI. The deal would allow businesses to use their data in the Snowflake Data Cloud.\n\nSNOW Stock: Looking For Thaw In Cloud Computing\nLarge companies have spent the past several quarters looking for ways to reduce \u2014 or optimize \u2014 spending on cloud services. But there were signs of improvement for the market leading up to Wednesday's earnings for Snowflake.\n\nNotably, Amazon (AMZN) earlier this month reported second-quarter sales growth for its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing unit that topped analyst expectations. SNOW stock climbed 3.5% in trading the day after Amazon's earnings report, on Aug. 4.\n\nProduct revenue for Snowflake increased 37% year over year to $642 million on the quarter. This metric accounts for customers using the company's software to store or analyze data.\n\nBut Snowflake management indicated its customers continue to keep an eye on software costs.\n\n\"Our forecast assumes that our largest customers will continue to be a growth headwind,\" Chief Financial Officer Michael Scarpelli said on the earnings call. \"We are seeing encouraging signs of stabilization, but not recovery.\"\n\nEncouraging Signs On Consumption\nSnowflake derives most of its revenue from charging for overall consumption of its product, rather than on a subscription basis.\n\nWilliam Blair reiterated an outperform rating on SNOW stock.\n\n\"Overall, though the company is still not in the clear regarding pressure on consumption, the signs are encouraging,\" William Blair analyst Jason Ader said in a note to clients. \"We expect that continued improvements in profitability as well as new growth tailwinds from AI should dovetail nicely with a recovery in cloud consumption next year.\"\n\nSNOW stock ended the regular trading session 2% higher at $155.70 on the stock market today. Overall, SNOW stock was up 8% for 2023 heading into earnings. But shares have fallen 12.5% this quarter.\n\nFurther, Snowflake stock holds a weak IBD Composite Rating of 56 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

{"text":"SUNNYSIDE, Wash. \u2014 Jose Martinez has lived and worked in the United States since he was 14 years old. Now 67, he drives around the Yakima Valley in Washington state checking on fellow workers.\n\n\"When it's hot, do you have a place to protect yourself from the sun and heat?\" he calls out to some workers on the side of an apple orchard on a sunny June morning.\n\nMartinez worked in agriculture across the fields of California and, most recently, Washington state. Irrigation, grapes, apples, mushrooms, dairies and now cherries. He's done a little bit of everything.\n\n\"I love the fields because you're in the open air,\" he told NPR in his native Spanish, sitting on the lawn outside his home in Sunnyside, Wash. \"It's beautiful. I am proud to do it, to be a farmworker. Why not?\"\n\nWhen people think of farmworkers, often they think of migrant workers and labor organizers like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Now, they may add another name to those creating major changes in the farming workplace: Jose Martinez.\n\nOver the past decade, Martinez has been central to two flagship lawsuits creating policy changes in the state \u2014 making Washington one of the leaders in providing overtime to farmworkers and settling a civil rights case in favor of workers. And recently, he has taken his fight to Washington, D.C., where he has pushed for an expansion of legal status and protections for farmworkers.\n\nFederally, farmworkers are largely excluded from many federal workplace safety regulations. They don't have a right to overtime pay or to unionize, and children as young as 12 can legally work in the fields. As a result, some states, like Washington, have extended additional rights and regulations.\n\nPresident Biden came into office with the goal of expanding protections to farmworkers, including providing a pathway to legal status, overtime pay, sick leave and protection from heat exposure. But despite being the self-proclaimed most pro-labor president, his administration has faced roadblocks such as stalled nominations and legislation in Congress, and slow rulemaking, to make big changes a reality.\n\nMartinez's route to legal advocacy has not been easy\nThe Washington worker's journey to becoming an activist began nearly 14 years ago. That's when Martinez began working in a dairy.\n\n\"At that dairy is when I started to see workplace violations and abuses from the foremen to the workers,\" Martinez recalled. \"And that's when I began to do something about the rights that we have as workers in the fields.\"\n\nMartinez said that while working, he and his fellow farmworkers didn't get lunch or other breaks.\n\nSo he sought the help of Columbia Legal Services, a law firm in Washington that, in part, focuses on immigration issues.\n\n\"We began to fight and that overtime [for farmworkers] was born within the state of Washington,\" he said.\n\nThe lawsuit he filed argued that a failure to provide overtime pay violates state protections against discrimination.\n\n\"In that dairy, you had to eat with a taco in one hand and work,\" he recalled. \"There were chemicals, rats. You had to eat and run among the cows. They said it was an eight-hour shift, but sometimes it was 12. And we were not paid overtime.\"\n\nDue to a Jim Crow-era exemption in federal law, most farmworkers in the U.S. do not have the right to overtime pay.\n\nMartinez wins overtime for dairy workers in the state\nIn the fall of 2020, the Washington Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that dairy workers should be entitled to overtime pay.\n\n\"Wow, I felt so emotional,\" Martinez said, remembering how he reacted to the court's decision.\n\nThe Washington state legislature then created a law to provide overtime for all farmworkers, a phased-in process that has already begun. By 2024, farmers will have to pay workers overtime after 40 hours.\n\nOther states, including California, Colorado and New York, have passed their own laws in recent years requiring additional pay for people working on farms specifically.\n\nMartinez said not all workers have been happy with the deal. As an unintended consequence, farmers are hiring more workers to avoid paying overtime wages, resulting in lower wages overall for some longtime employees. While some advocates say they expected this to happen in some instances, Martinez told NPR he did not.\n\nThese farmworkers thought a new overtime law would help them. Now, they want it gone\n\"There are a few different points of view,\" he acknowledged, saying that some workers blame him for their now-smaller paychecks. \"But why don't we work the same long hours and get paid better? Why don't they pay us better?\"\n\nJose Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers after a COVID-19 outbreak at the mushroom farm where he was then employed and is now working with the group to form a union at the facility.\nMike Kane for NPR\nSome farmworkers want to get rid of the overtime law. Martinez sees it differently. He's going for bigger change \u2014 higher wages so that farmworkers don't feel they need to work 60 to 70 hours a week in harvest season to make enough to live on.\n\n\"I had faith that when I start something, I will finish it and it will be done,\" he said. \"I've never been afraid.\"\n\nA civil rights lawsuit rises out of a mushroom farm\nMartinez ultimately quit the dairy. He moved on to work for a fruit packing company, which he said had better working conditions. But the company closed to become a winery. In 2020, he began work only a few miles away at Ostrom Mushroom Farms, a mushroom producer later acquired by the Canadian company Windmill Farms.\n\nJust over a year after being at Ostrom, Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers, an organization that he recalled from his years on farms in the San Joaquin Valley in California. He voiced concerns over poor treatment from supervisors and went public about COVID-19 outbreaks. During those conversations Martinez tipped off a lawsuit through the state attorney general's office over gender discrimination.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the mushroom farm would pay $3.4 million to about 170 workers, resolving a lawsuit \"asserting unfair, deceptive and discriminatory actions against female farmworkers and Washington-based workers.\"\n\nFerguson told NPR that while he believes this is a case of a very bad actor, it won't be his office's last case and farmworkers are among the workers in the most difficult position to advocate for themselves.\n\n\"They may not be documented, they may not speak English, there are restrictions that make it difficult,\" Ferguson explained, as to why they may not speak up.\n\nMartinez agrees that getting workers to want to talk is a challenge.\n\n\"It was really hard at first to convince the workers [to speak up],\" Martinez said. \"First thing they said is 'they'll chase me out; I have bills to pay and a family.'\"\n\nMartinez, who has legal status, says workers who are undocumented are even more afraid to voice concerns. It is estimated that over half of all farmworkers in the U.S. are undocumented and those on visas are tied to their employers for housing, transportation and documentation.\n\n\"There is sometimes a misunderstanding about the rights that we have as workers,\" Martinez said. \"But when we are working somewhere, we do have rights to a certain extent.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, he noticed workers were arriving on seasonal H-2A visas, and women were particularly being laid off.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I told them I also have a family, but I want to stop this and what they are doing is not right \u2014 they are violating your rights as a worker and we all have rights,\" Martinez explained.\n\n\nIt's hot. For farmworkers without federal heat protections, it could be life or death\nHe's now leading a unionization effort at the mushroom farm. But should a union ever be recognized, Martinez won't be part of it.

{"text":"NEW YORK \u2014 RXO\u2019s chief strategy officer conceded to a conference here that he didn\u2019t have much fresh to say in terms of the company\u2019s market or overall outlook, but given the relative strength of the 3PL\u2019s first-quarter performance, no news remains relatively bullish news.\n\nAt the UBS Global Industrial and Transportation Conference, a two-day \u201cdog and pony\u201d for money managers eyeing investments in the sector, RXO Director of Strategy Jared Weisfeld said RXO (NYSE: RXO) is sticking to its earlier prediction that it would grow its brokerage volumes in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis. Those volumes were up 6% in the first quarter relative to a year ago in a period that marked one of the worst freight markets in several years.\n\nThe RXO forecast for higher volumes does not come with a specific number.\n\nThat prediction of an increase in second-quarter brokerage volumes \u201cis not something we do lightly,\u201d said Weisfeld, the sole representative of the company at the gathering. \u201cWe took a look at all the evidence, all the business momentum that we had in the second half of April and the first half of May, and we were very confident. \n\nRXO\u2019s earnings were released in early May, with April business done and May business more definitive at the time of the forecast.\n\n\u201cOur share gains are accelerating,\u201d Weisfeld said in an interview with Tom Wadewitz, the senior equity research analyst at UBS who leads the transportation group. \n\nWeisfeld said RXO, spun off as an asset-light brokerage last year from XPO (NYSE: XPO), is gaining market share. \u201cAnd importantly, they\u2019re profitable market share gains.\u201d He said gross margins in brokerage are \u201cnorth of 16%\u201d year on year.\n\nRXO previously has set a clear financial goal: Have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $500 million by the middle of 2027. The company had adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of $37 million.\n\nWhile the road to $500 million in EBITDA does include adding more customers in the small-to-medium business sector, the so-called SMB firms, Weisfeld said the shippers that utilize RXO are overwhelmingly the size of companies that could make it into the Fortune 500. \n\nAsked what other 3PLs RXO runs into the most when pitching contract business to those customers, Wesfield\u2019s first answer was no surprise: C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), which before RXO became a stand-alone 3PL was pretty much the only pure-play, publicly traded brokerage company between when Echo Global Logistics was acquired by a private equity firm in 2021 and when RXO made its debut last year.\n\nThe other company Weisfeld identified was Arrive Logistics. \u201cWhen you think about who we compete against and the dynamics of our market [large shippers], it really is just those two folks,\u201d he said. \n\nWhile Weisfeld may not have supplied new numbers, he did talk about the strategy that has led to those recent and projected gains. \n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t compete on price in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThe asset-based carriers set the price.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, the focus is on service and technology. Weisfeld described customer support as \u201cthe intersection of technology and human capital.\u201d And while 96% of loads brokered by RXO in the first quarter were covered digitally, all drivers have carrier representatives assigned to them and they are often involved in ensuring the freight gets to the final destination. \n\nWeisfeld also noted that 3PLs in general are riding a secular shift toward more shippers turning to brokerages for their freight needs. A decade ago, he said, brokers had market share in the \u201clow double digits,\u201d but he put that figure now at \u201cnorth of 20%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better solution,\u201d he said. He cited broker access to \u201cmassive capacity\u201d and \u201cthe ability to be flexible and agile and offer solutions.\u201d And it is because of those solutions, he said, that RXO has chosen not to try to compete through price, citing \u201cservice and technology\u201d as the primary RXO value proposition. \n\nWeisfeld said first-quarter contract revenue was about 77% of the company\u2019s overall revenue, which is high by historical standards. He said the range of that at RXO tends to be between 60% and 80%.\n\n\u201cWe think about how we\u2019re positioning the company for future market share gains for when the cycle inflects,\u201d Weisfeld said. (The terms \u201cinflect\u201d and \u201cinflection point\u201d was heard from multiple presenters at the UBS conference, a reference to the unknown date when the current weak freight market will turn higher.)\n\nEven as new data suggested that there is little sign of an upturn in the freight market, Weisfeld  cited various conditions \u2014 echoed at times by others at the conference \u2014 that suggested a bottom may be at hand.\n\nHe said the \u201cactive network capacity\u201d of carriers at RXO was down 3% sequentially in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022. He said the load-to-truck ratio was below two in April, extremely low by historical standards; the inflection should take that up to four\/six to one, he said.\n\nCustomers are reporting to RXO that their de-stocking of inventories is near an end or already has gotten there. \u201cSo I think all those are pretty positive forward-looking indicators as it relates to the bottoming process,\u201d Weisfeld said. \u201cWhen will that happen? It\u2019s unclear.\u201d\n\nGiven the collapse in spot rates, the question was put to Weisfeld  by Wadewitz: Why hasn\u2019t capacity pulled out of the market even faster?\n\nWeisfeld cited several reasons for the stickiness of capacity. \u201cNumber one, the good times lasted for a long time,\u201d he said. Balance sheets might be relatively strong with cash stockpiled during the strong market of 2021 and the first half of 2022. \u201cI think that likely has kept capacity in the system for longer than a typical cycle,\u201d he said.\n\nA second reason: lower fuel prices. But Weisfeld noted that the growing reports of bankruptcies and shutdowns suggest that those factors can only go so far in keeping trucks on the road.\n\nRXO should have a good window into what is going on with independent owner-operators; Weisfeld said about half the capacity hired by the 3PL comes from one-truck fleets.

Last year, Hyundai patented eye scanner tech to replace car keys. \n\nCar dashboard showing apps from a phone\nData can be collected whenever drivers plug into their cars USB or use Bluetooth.\nShutterstock\n\u201cThe second source,\u201d Amico added, \u201care the devices drivers and passengers bring inside the vehicle. Most people don\u2019t realize that when they connect their phones [Bluetooth, wifi, USB, even if just using screen mirroring technologies such as Android Auto or Apple CarPlay] cars download all sorts of information from our personal devices.\u201d\n\nThat includes, he said, \u201cAnything from your actual text messages to what apps are running on your phone, as well as your social media, logs of photos taken and files downloaded and much more are sucked out from people\u2019s devices when they connect to take a hands-free call or use their favorite mapping app.\u201d\n\nMuch of this data is stored in the cloud, which has proven over and over to be hackable.\n\nHands on a keyboard\nHackers have shown they can take over the various systems of a car.\nGetty Images\nIn May, Toyota revealed a cloud data breach that exposed the car-location information of 2,150,000 drivers from November 2013, to April 2023.\n\nBut hackers actually have a number of entry points through cars. They can access the in-car computer system, allowing them to take control of various systems \u2014 including the throttle and brakes \u2014 as security experts did on a Jeep Cherokee back in 2015, for a Wired demonstration. USB data ports and key fobs are also accessible. \n\nVehicle hacking is a growing problem, one that is expected to get many times worse as cars go from being smartphones on wheels to supercomputers on wheels. \n\nAlso: In 2021, the country\u2019s leading car brand, Ford, filed a patent for technology that will display advertisements directly in your car.

{"text":"The input costs to farm have been continually rising for many years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) February 2023 Farm Sector Income forecast projected total farm production expenses in 2023 at nearly $500 billion, up 4% from the prior year, but up $87 billion, or more than 28%, from 2020. For those raising livestock, looking outside of the typical commodity markets and focusing on direct-to-consumer meat sales may be an opportunity to increase revenue.\n\nGarth Ruff, Ohio State Extension Beef Cattle Field Specialist, noticed the trend of direct-to-consumer sales increase in the wake of COVID in 2020. Many people turned to their local livestock producers for protein, instead of going to the grocery store.\n\n\u201cDuring COVID, we had quite a few calls and a high amount of people interested in selling directly to consumers. It\u2019s leveled out since then. That\u2019s been our big question the last few years, how many of these direct-to-consumer sales will be maintained?\u201d Ruff said. \u201cAs long as the customer has a positive eating experience, they will continue to buy and spend money with that livestock producer.\u201d\n\nTo sell and price meat profitably, Ruff states that first, you must know your cost of production. Keeping accurate and consistent records of expenses is key.\n\n\u201cIf a producer doesn\u2019t know what their production costs are, then we start looking at USDA reports, which gives us a baseline for prices,\u201d Ruff said.\n\nFrom there, a livestock producer needs to consider what margin they want to make, as well as the market demand. Researching the customer base and their values can help to price meat profitably. For example, a livestock producer with aspirations to sell their products at an urban city farmer\u2019s market, where there\u2019s more disposable income, is probably able to charge higher prices than a producer selling to a less affluent, more rural area.\n\nBesides the cost of production of the animal itself, Ruff shared that many producers tend to forget the cost of customer acquisition.\n\n\u201cA big thing I\u2019ve seen is that there is a cost to acquire customers, whether that\u2019s marketing, fuel, or just your time. A lot of producers don\u2019t necessarily value their time appropriately. I don\u2019t think most people would take a job for $8 an hour, so that\u2019s not the labor cost you should set for marketing your meat,\u201d Ruff said.\n\nWhen it comes to customer acquisition, many livestock producers turn to word of mouth or social media to help sell their products. Andy Stockmaster is a livestock producer in New Washington in Crawford County. Every year he sells roughly a dozen head of freezer beef and around 25 to 30 hogs to people using Facebook as his marketing platform.  \n\n\u201cWe try to sell all our livestock directly to customers. Taking livestock to the sale barn is our last resort,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I do find it hard to set prices, I think I do have better control of my prices by selling directly. I like that my product then ends up with local families and in the community.\u201d\n\nStockmaster tends to sell all his livestock as whole carcasses, halves or quarters. He tried cuts but found he didn\u2019t have enough interest to continue down that route.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult part of pricing is that I want to give my customers an affordable price, but I have a profit figure in my head that I have to reach too,\u201d Stockmaster said.\n\nStockmaster follows Ruff\u2019s model, by taking his cost of production and then setting a margin he would like to achieve.\n\n\u201cI try to also compare to the market prices at that time too for both the live animal and retail cuts, and try to set prices in that ballpark,\u201d Stockmaster said.\n\nWhile beef and pork are proteins that many consumers are familiar with, Rose Hartschuh is looking to drive demand for lamb. Hartschuh and her family, also in Crawford County, currently have a small freezer lamb business, with around five to 10 lambs a year being sold directly to customers.\n\n\nFreezer lamb is an area of potential growth as customers are familiarized with the various cuts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different than selling freezer beef and pork. With beef and pork, you can get a customer to commit to a half or a quarter. With lamb, people are more hesitant, so we sell lamb by the cut,\u201d Hartschuh said. \u201cWe have to be above what the sale barn charges every week. We try to work backward a little bit. We also have to keep into account the dressing percentage of the lamb too. They are lower yielding animals than a steer or a hog.\u201d \n\nHartschuh goes to a processor that is about an hour away from her farm in Lykens. The processor is more familiar with lambs and goats and offers a wider variety of cut options. One way they market lamb is by offering cuts that anyone can cook.\n\n\u201cWe like to get burgers and bratwursts made because they are easy to grill. We also do a lot of boneless leg of lamb, because those are easy to cook in the oven, crockpot or smoker. We also sell beef and pork, so we\u2019ve created bundle deals or we throw in some lamb for people to try,\u201d Hartschuh said. \u201cOur goal is to continue to grow our freezer lamb business because we can set our price, it\u2019s consistent revenue and additional cash flow through the year. It\u2019s got big potential to grow.\u201d \n\nFor those producers who are looking for help in establishing pricing for cuts, Penn State Extension recently published a model for pricing to remain profitable. First, start with the per pound cost of the live animal. This would include all costs of production. Next, divide this amount by the dressing percentage. The average dressing percentage is 60% for cattle, 70% for hogs and 50% for sheep and goats. This is now the hanging cost. Next, add any processing or trucking fees to the hanging cost. Divide the total by 65% to get a cut-out cost, and then divide that cut-out cost by the percentage markup the producer desires to reach. This will lead to a price that should be charged per pound.\n\nRuff and a team of other Ohio State Extension personnel are working to address the big push for local foods and direct-to-consumer meats. They are in the process of putting together a self-paced course on how to start and maintain a food business.\n\n\u201cThis past winter we had good attendance in the webinar series we did on starting a local food business. Our team can offer resources on food safety, labeling and understanding all the legalities of selling meat directly to people,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some mislabeling the last couple of years, so those are things we talk about in our programs quite a bit. You can\u2019t use USDA quality grades to sell your product unless it\u2019s truly been graded. Those are things you need to know upfront if you are going to sell directly to consumers.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that all meat sold direct-to-consumer needs to be USDA or Ohio Department of Agriculture inspected for food safety. Producers looking to sell at farmer\u2019s markets or local businesses need to work with their county health departments in order to do that. The OSU Extension webinar series on starting a food business from this past winter is available to view at https:\/\/farmoffice.osu.edu\/our-library\/food-law\/starting-food-business","labels":[]}
{"text":"Famous for its geyser valley, rivers, bears, volcanos and exceptional biodiversity, the \u2018pristine\u2019 Kamchatka peninsula in Russia\u2019s Far East has been the scene of massive die-off of benthic marine organisms.\n\nIn mid-September, the seawater changed its colour and took on an unpleasant smell. People reported health effects. Dead sea animals washed ashore, leaving carcasses along many of the beaches. \n\nLocals, especially surfers, were the first to post about the environmental disaster on social media. They said that after surfing they were experiencing sore throat, eye pain, and itching skin from being in contact with the water. Some of them reported nausea and vomiting. At Greenpeace Russia, we listened to their stories and formed a team to investigate.\n\nThe unique nature of Kamchatka is under threat\nAccording to local scientists, the event has killed 95% of marine life on the surrounding seabed. The scale and cause of the disaster is still unknown, but we do know that a large part of the coastal area around the Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO world heritage site has been impacted. Results of water analyses taken by the Russian authorities and Greenpeace Russia gave little clue as to the cause. The die-off could have been caused both by natural events or as a result of human activity.\n\nEnvironmental Disaster in Kamchatka. \u00a9 RFE_RL\nKamchatka, near the Khalaktyr beach. Hundreds of dead sea animals washed ashore.\n\u00a9 RFE_RL\nThe Greenpeace Russia team arrived in Kamchatka on the 4th of October to bear witness to this environmental disaster. Researchers took samples of seawater, soil and dead animals found on the central city beach of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and sent them to Moscow to be analysed. Campaigners are also exploring the southern part of the peninsula from a ship, together with scientists and researchers from Kamchatka\u2019s Kronotsky Nature Reserve. Divers on the ship are set to examine the ocean floor to the north and south of Kamchatka. An underwater drone with a high-definition camera has been used. Underwater photography and sample collection here may help to reveal the extent of this ecological disaster in the Pacific Ocean and perhaps give some clues as to what caused it.\n\nInvestigation and transparency now\nGiven the fact that the cause of this die-off has not, as yet, been established, Greenpeace Russia is demanding an independent, transparent investigation into the cause and the scale of this highly damaging event. Meanwhile, Greenpeace Russia teams in Kamchatka, Moscow and St.Petersburg are consulting a range of experts to try to understand what might have happened. Initial analysis of satellite images from September indicate that the soil around the rivers that flow into the ocean may have become eroded. But, as long as the cause remains  unknown, many hypotheses remain on the table. These range from natural causes such as toxic phytoplankton growth, seismic or volcanic activity, to human activities such as toxic waste dumping, a fuel spill or tanker accident, or military activity. But so far the search for the cause must continue. \n\nRussia needs a green and just transition\nInvestigating the ecological disaster in Kamchatka has shown that the region has a huge number of unresolved environmental problems. Landfills with hazardous waste, disposal sites, burial sites. If not immediately, then in the future these may cause new problems. Dangerous landfills in Kamchatka and whole Russia should be mapped, checked and reclaimed. \n\nWhatever the cause of the Kamchatka disaster, one thing for sure is that, to protect people and nature from environmental disasters, Russia needs to shift away from an economic model based on extraction and exploitation. Pollution impacts are spiralling out of control. Earlier this year, in the Russian Arctic, we saw one of the worst environmental disasters in the country\u2019s history. A plant operated by Nornickel \u2014 whose factories in the area have made the city of Norilsk one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth \u2014 spewed thousands of tonnes of oil into land and water in Taimyr, Siberia, turning the Ambarnaya River red. As with so many environmental and human wrongs, the damage landed heaviest on Indigenous and ethnic minority groups. \n\nEven if Kamchatka was a natural event, ecological disasters like those that have happened in Norilsk and elsewhere in the Russian Arctic underline the need for green and just transition. Russia needs to move away from polluting industries that are wrecking lives and costing the Earth, and towards renewable energy and jobs that sustain households and workers and protect the environment. This must be reflected in government policies. \n\nGreenpeace Russia is urging the government to support people on the frontlines of environmental crises, to tighten environmental policy to prevent future disasters, and to adopt a long-term program for green transformation of the economy. A shift towards a green economy would not only reduce environment and climate impacts but also help to address the ongoing social, health and economic crisis. We need a Green Recovery Plan for Russia and we need it now.","labels":[]}
{"text":"More generous unemployment benefits doled out during the pandemic appear to have been a magnet for fraud, according to a government watchdog report released on Tuesday.\n\nAs much as $135 billion of the roughly $900 billion in benefits claimed between April 2020 and May 2023 \u2014 about 15 percent \u2014 was likely illegally claimed, the Government Accountability Office said on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the coronavirus shut down much of the economy, the federal government extended and expanded unemployment benefits to help keep millions of Americans who lost their jobs financially afloat. But the sheer demand for aid and the need for states \u2014 which administer payments \u2014 to quickly roll out new relief programs increased the risk of fraud.\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the full scope of the fraud \u201cwill likely never be known with certainty.\u201d\n\nThe expanded unemployment benefits were part of trillions in relief money sent to individuals and businesses after the onset of the pandemic. In the federal government\u2019s haste to get relief money out the door, much of it was distributed with few strings attached and little oversight. That has led to a flood of criminals taking advantage of seemingly easy ways to obtain free money. Federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents have since deployed various methods to try to catch fraudsters and recoup billions.\n\nThe Labor Department, which oversees federal unemployment insurance programs, expressed concerns about the report\u2019s methodology and argued that the level of fraud was likely overstated. Officials pointed to efforts that have since been taken to deter fraud, and said the \u201cenormous task\u201d of doling out the funds was made \u201conly more daunting by the decades-long chronic underfunding\u201d of the unemployment benefits system.\n\n\u201cAs a result, state agencies were unprepared for the extraordinary spike in the number of claims to be processed each week,\u201d Brent Parton, a principal deputy assistant secretary at the department, wrote in the letter.\n\nLast month, Justice Department officials announced that the federal government had charged 3,195 defendants with offenses related to pandemic fraud and seized more than $1.4 billion in relief funds. That came after the department carried out a three-month \u201csweep\u201d to combat Covid-19 fraud, which ended in July and involved more than 50 U.S. attorney\u2019s offices and dozens of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nSome of those charged have been accused of stealing millions in pandemic unemployment benefits after submitting fraudulent applications. In one case, prosecutors said, individuals used the funds to solicit a murder for hire and to purchase firearms, controlled substances, jewelry, clothing and vacations.\n\nInvestigations into potential fraud are still ongoing. According to a June report from the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General, about 163,000 investigations related to unemployment benefits paid during the pandemic were still open.\n\nIn February, the office estimated that at least $191 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits could have been made improperly, with a significant amount attributable to fraud.\n\nPandemic relief for small businesses was also targeted by fraudsters. The Small Business Administration\u2019s inspector general has estimated that more than $200 billion \u2014 or at least 17 percent of the roughly $1.2 trillion in pandemic loans the agency doled out \u2014 was disbursed to \u201cpotentially fraudulent actors.\u201d","labels":[]}

{"text":"BOSTON - The state Department of Environmental Protection has hit a New York-based freight company with $34,000 in fines for failure to clean up an oil spill at the Charlton service area on the Massachusetts Turnpike.\n\nJNR Freight Solutions Corp. of New York was fined for failure to address a 100-gallon diesel fuel release from one of its vehicles at the service area.\n\nOn May 1, 2019, a truck owned and operated by JNR Freight Solutions Corp. struck a light pole at the service area. The accident damaged the truck\u2019s diesel fuel tank, causing 100 gallons of diesel fuel to spill onto the pavement and soil. MassDEP performed initial cleanup activities at the site with a state-funded contractor and notified the freight company of its liability and requirements to engage a licensed site professional to oversee and clean up the fuel.\n\nIn the subsequent months, JNR Freight Solutions failed to engage an LSP or conduct any of the required cleanup actions and has not responded to MassDEP\u2019s efforts to enter a negotiated settlement to address the violations.","labels":[]}
{"text":"Transport & Environment (T&E) welcomes today\u2019s vote to advance the Critical Raw Materials Act in the European Parliament, given the urgency of onshoring and diversifying a sustainable supply of critical metals needed for Europe\u2019s green transition. MEPs on the industry committee increased to 50% the proposed target for refining and processing critical metals such as nickel, lithium and copper within the EU.\n\nJulia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at T&E, said: \u201cThe EU is right not to rely on outsourcing one of the most valuable parts of the battery supply chain to a highly concentrated market overseas. These targets mean Europe will onshore refining and processing, ensure it is done sustainably, and develop expertise in these areas that it currently doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\nT&E called for MEPs to retain the EU\u2019s environmental rules around water quality, waste disposal, biodiversity and community engagement while simplifying and speeding up permitting procedures. It welcomed the industry committee\u2019s tightening of the criteria around certification schemes to ensure multi-stakeholder involvement and on-site audits.\n\nJulia Poliscanova said: \u201cThis can only be a green transition if we secure a sustainable supply of critical metals. Any attempts to waterdown Europe\u2019s environmental protections must be fiercely resisted. Crucially, Europe should not over-rely on often dubious certification schemes for compliance. We hope EU governments take on board Parliament\u2019s amendments on those.\u201d\n\nWhile the goals of the Critical Raw Materials Act are essential, Europe still lacks the means to meet them on time, T&E said. German and French state aid will not be able to compete with China and the US for battery investments. T&E and 18 other organisations and companies have called on Europe to turn its Innovation Fund into a green industry bank and use it to scale best-in-class projects throughout the battery supply chain.","labels":[]}

{"text":"Dec 16 (Reuters) - Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) has finalized a $698 million settlement with the U.S. state of Oregon to resolve claims that it polluted the environment with chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, the German pharmaceutical company and the state said Thursday.\n\nThe deal, first disclosed in August, follows similar agreements with five other states and the District of Columbia, and with a nationwide class of municipal entities. Bayer still faces several other state lawsuits over PCBs.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it did not admit liability as part of the Oregon settlement, and would continued to defend the remaining cases.\n\nOregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum called the settlement a \"huge win\" that would give the state resources to clean up PCBs.\n\nThe lawsuits against Bayer stem from PCBs manufactured by U.S. seeds and pesticide company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired for $63 billion in 2018. Monsanto sold PCBs from 1935 until 1977, when it voluntarily ceased production.\n\nThe chemicals were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and in carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. The U.S. government outlawed PCBs in 1979 after discovering links to cancer.\n\nIn addition to lawsuits by states and cities, Bayer is facing claims by hundreds of people who say they were harmed by PCBs in fluorescent lights at a Washington state school. Some of those cases have gone to trial and resulted in jury verdicts against Bayer totaling $543 million, which the company is appealing.\n\n","labels":[]}
{"text":"BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 The Christmas blizzard of 2022 is long in the rearview mirror for a lot of people in Western New York, particularly as we languish in the heat of the August sun. \n\nOfficials with the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, however, are analyzing their response to the historic storm. \n\n\nOverall, 47 people were killed in the longest lasting blizzard below an altitude of 5,000 feet. Blizzard conditions engulfed Western New York around 8:45 a.m. on Friday, December 23 and lasted until Tuesday, December 27. \n\nOn Christmas, the storm shifted from a blizzard to a lake effect snow event. \n\nThe 33-page report, released by NYSDHSES, stated that 50 interviews were conducted and over 1,300 pages of relevant documents were reviewed. \n\nThe report highlighted poor communication, language and coordination as areas that impacted the states response. \n\nIt also points to the public underestimating the severity of the storm. \n\n\"When the storm that would become the Blizzard of \u201922 was initially forecast, it is possible that some WNY residents underestimated the need to prepare, given the recent relative ease of storm experience in November 2022,\" the report said. \n\nRegarding communication, the report highlights that the state did not use its NY-Alert system \"due to a low subscriber base.\"\n\nNY-Alert is a platform that users can receive emergency alerts from the state via phone, email, text or fax. \n\nOther communication that needs review is the way state agencies phrased announcements to the public. For example, the report highlights a communication by the NYSDOT for motorists to \"heed all warnings.\"\n\n\"A reference to 'heed all warnings' could have been enhanced by referring to the specific rules in place at that time,\" the report said. \n\nThe issue of the travel ban was a topic conversation and finger pointing in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The state report doesn't outright indicate a state travel ban should have been initiated earlier, but rather points to the evolving forecast as the reason why it wasn't.  \n\n\"This ban was enacted after inclement conditions appeared in the early morning, instead of Friday afternoon as the State planned for based on Thursday night\u2019s forecast. The midmorning travel ban meant that some drivers were still on the roads or had planned to be on the roads that day \u2013 even as the weather quickly deteriorated.\"\n\n\nAccording to the report, various state agencies rescued 649 people from the roads at the height of the blizzard. One recommendation in the report is for more state roads installing barriers. \n\n\"The State should consider the feasibility of adding additional barriers on roads that do not already have them, to allow for greater enforcement of travel bans.\"\n\nState officials did cite that Erie County was not using a current version of standard emergency management software. The report states that \"there were still usability challenges for response staff\" because the county uses an older version. \n\nErie County executive Mark Poloncarz rebuffed that conclusion in the report and said that \"there are no compatibility issues.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to 2 On Your Side, the county executive said:\n\n\"Erie County was proud to participate in New York State's After Action Report of the Christmas Blizzard by providing full access to all key county personnel involved in the storm response. We will be incorporating any relevant findings into our very active winter storm preparation process that is already well underway.\"\n\nBuffalo Mayor Brown, or anyone else from the administration, was unavailable for an interview regarding the report. Mayor Brown's office sent a statement saying:\n\n\"The Mayor is aware the State's After Action Report for the response to the December Blizzard is completed. City staff participated in the process as requested and we are currently reviewing the document. As previously announced, the City has established a Storm Response Task Force and has already purchased new equipment and adopted new storm-fighting procedures.\"\n\nOverall the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services didn't give itself a passing or failing grade in regards to their response to the blizzard. But the state acknowledges areas where agencies are working in silos and more collaboration is needed. \n\n\n\"The system cannot improve in isolation. Going forward, state agency partners, along with local officials should work towards an improved state emergency management through intentional communication.\"","labels":[]}

{"text":"Like digitization for the past few decades, decarbonization is a \u201cmegatrend\u201d for the global financial markets, Rama Variankaval, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s Center for Carbon Transition, told CNBC.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re an energy client, or a consumer products client, or a retail client, there is something about this megatrend that is going to impact your business model, your business,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\nRama Variankaval, global head of the center for carbon transition for JP Morgan Securities LLC, speaks during the Aspen Ideas: Climate conference in Miami Beach, Florida, US, on Thursday, March, 9, 2023. Aspen Ideas: Climate is a solutions-focused event designed for the public to interact with and learn from climate leaders whose ideas and actions are critical to address our collective future.\nRama Variankaval, global head of the center for carbon transition for JP Morgan Securities LLC, speaks during the Aspen Ideas: Climate conference in Miami Beach, Florida, US, on Thursday, March, 9, 2023. Aspen Ideas: Climate is a solutions-focused event designed for the public to interact with and learn from climate leaders whose ideas and actions are critical to address our collective future.\n\nRama Variankaval is in his 20th year at JPMorgan Chase\n and at the end of 2020, he expanded his role in the corporate finance advisory arm of the bank to help spearhead the bank\u2019s strategy on decarbonization, which refers to reducing or eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from a system or process.\n\nHe calls decarbonization a \u201cmegatrend\u201d in global financial markets, much like digitization has been for the last few decades.\n\n\u201cAt any point in time, there are certain megatrends that impact more than just a narrow part of the economy,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC in a video interview earlier in August. In his career at JPMorgan, Variankaval\u2019s mission has been to identify and have a viewpoint on what those megatrends are and then to \u201cdirect our energies, our efforts, our balance sheets, to align with those megatrends.\u201d\n\nHe believes decarbonization makes the grade because global regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will touch every business in every part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re an energy client, or a consumer products client, or a retail client, there is something about this megatrend that is going to impact your business model, your business,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nJPMorgan is looking be a big lender in the sector. The bank has said it aims in the coming decade to finance more than $2.5 trillion in projects that advance climate and sustainable development goals.\n\nMegatrend started around 2020\nThe topic of ESG \u2014 environmental, social, and corporate governance \u2014 investing started coming up in 2018 \u201cquite frequently,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC. That focus on an investing strategy incorporating nonfinancial measures of responsibilities proved to be a harbinger of the increasingly intense focus on climate.\n\nClimate change has been an issue for much longer than decarbonization has been a global financial megatrend, but a number of factors coincided to make decarbonization a business imperative.\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement, adopted by 196 parties at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, was \u201ca fairly massive catalyst,\u201d Variankaval said.\n\nBy 2020, large asset owners, like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, started to prioritize decarbonization \u201cwith higher intensity,\u201d Variankaval noted.\n\nAs the largest asset owners started to prioritize decarbonization, their influence trickled down and influenced the behavior of other financial gatekeepers. Asset managers started asking the companies where they were making investments to start focusing resources and operations on decarbonization. For publicly traded companies, that pressure came in the form of proxy votes on issues relating to decarbonization.\n\nIn 2020, JPMorgan formally announced its Center for Carbon Transition, a group responsible for designing and implementing the bank\u2019s strategy around climate and sustainability as it pertains to its client-facing businesses, and to also engage with those companies about that strategy \u201cbecause we felt everyone was thinking about these topics,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s landmark climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed in August 2022, further established the megatrend, accelerating the flow of capital into decarbonization and low-carbon technologies like solar, wind, green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, carbon capture, and other areas.\n\nThe IRA lowered the net cost of capital for these decarbonization technology companies by as much as 5%, according to Variankaval, because it made it cheaper for decarbonization companies to put together their capital stack, or financing for deals. Deals that were typically done with a combination of debt and equity got a third source of capital added to the mix: tax credits and the associated tax equity.\n\nThe IRA happened just as the broader economy simultaneously slowed as interest rates climbed to combat rising inflation. Those higher rates in the broader economy counteracted against some of the incentives of the IRA, but even with that backdrop the legislation has turbocharged the sector. By JPMorgan\u2019s count, more than $100 billion worth of investments have been announced in just the last year with a direct link to the IRA, says Variankaval.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s about $50 billion a year going into climate tech companies via private funding and venture capital funding pathways, Variankaval said.\n\n\u201cWe see massive amounts of capital formation happening around the climate theme, or around the decarbonization theme, and we absolutely want to be the bank that is a leader in helping our clients navigate that, whether they are small clients or big clients,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nWhile the IRA is specific to the United States, companies and governments are reevaluating their own industrial policies around the globe to focus more on resiliency.\n\n\u201cWe went, I think, a period of 15, 20, 30 years, where efficiency was the No. 1 guiding principle of how you organize yourself,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC. The thinking was \u201clet\u2019s find the cheapest place to do every part of our supply chain, and stitch it all together.\u201d\n\nBut now, the resiliency of a company\u2019s supply chain is being given as much priority as efficiency. And sustainability is a keystone of resiliency.\n\nIn addition to a sharpening global focus on decarbonization, the Covid-19 pandemic shone a spotlight on the importance of supply chains, their vulnerability and the importance of focusing on resiliency in supply chain management.\n\n\u201cAll of these are coming together in a way to, I think, be perhaps the largest change in how capital flows that at least I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to be picking winners and losers\nIn addition to helping its clients adapt to a decarbonizing economy, JPMorgan also sees opportunity in being the go-to bank for the burgeoning and potentially high-growth sector of climate tech companies.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely want to be there with them at the ground level, and then have these companies grow with us. We want to be the bank of their choice,\u201d Variankaval said.\n\nRight now, though, it\u2019s too soon to name the climate tech companies that will be the winners or losers.\n\n\u201cIn a more traditional way of bringing about changes, a lot of research gets done in academic labs and government labs, and then people take it out and test it out in the commercial setting, and figure out what works, what doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a multi-decade-long process,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\nIt took two decades for the internet to go from invention to wide business adoption, and in this case \u201cwe don\u2019t have the luxury of time when it comes to climate tech to go through the long-run process,\u201d Variankaval said.\n\nIn some segments of climate tech, there are debates about which solutions are better than others that take on a near-religious fervor. The JPMorgan exec says that\u2019s not particularly helpful.\n\n\u201cWe have to deploy capital across all likely solutions, knowing that some may not really work as promised and the use cases may not quite be what we think they could be today. But others might surprise. And some might kick into action sooner, some might just take longer to kick into action. So you need to diversify in terms of technologies, but also in time horizons,\u201d Variankaval told CNBC.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really pick winners and losers at this point. We\u2019re just too early. And that is at least how we think about it,\u201d he said.\n\n","labels":[]}
{"text":"What does it take to be a supply chain visionary? That was the question answered by Ignacio Arranz at the NextGen Supply Chain Conference in Chicago October 17 \u2013 19, 2022.\n\nArranz, Procter & Gamble\u2019s Senior Vice President of Supply Innovation and Global Physical Distribution, accepted this year\u2019s Visionary Award on behalf of the leader in the CPG space. The annual award, which is sponsored by the Association for Supply Chain Management, is given to a supply chain organization that is leading the way in its vertical.\n\nIn a 30-minute fireside chat moderated by Abe Eshkenzi, CEO of ASCM, Arranz explained the evolution of P&G\u2019s supply chain from Supply 1.0 to Supply 3.0. In Supply 1.0, the organization was focused internally on optimizing P&G\u2019s manufacturing operations. Supply 2.0 added an external lens to the supply chain, including the integration of planning with suppliers, digitalization and the first steps towards the end-to-end synchronization of the supply chain.\n\nP&G was the winner of this year\u2019s Visionary Award at NextGen 2022. Ignacio Arranz (Right) discusses the CPG leader\u2019s new direciton with Abe Eshkenazi, CEO of ASCM.\n\nIn Supply 3.0, P&G is building an end-to-end synchronized, sustainable and resilient supply chain, amplified by data analytics and enabled by an organization that is at the leading edge of transformation, mastery and leadership. \n\nArranz described a framework built around four pillars: Resiliency to supply in full; seamless data interconnection with customers and suppliers; enabling the company to meet its 2040 sustainability goals; and a superior workforce and Integrated Work Systems (IWS) 5.0 across the end-to-end supply chain.\n\nSeparately, P&G executives Adrienne C Palermo and Jessica Robledo Garcia presented how the company is accelerating business value by digitally upskilling its supply chain professionals, beginning at the line level. The Citizen Developer initiative puts programming tools in the hands of employees at all levels of the organization, empowering them to develop new applications to solve persistent problems, such as predicting the impact of extreme weather events on P&G\u2019s portfolio of products.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the NextGen Visionary Award recognizes companies undertaking initiatives that span the processes recognized by the SCOR model, along with talent development, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion or other ESG initiatives.\n\nPast winners include:\n\n2020 \u2013 Honeywell, which went above and beyond to transform its facilities and assets to produce badly needed PPE during the early days of the pandemic and transform a convention center in Miami into a treatment facility for COVID patients.\n\n2021 \u2013 American Eagle Outfitters, AEO, for its Supply Chain 2.0 initiative, which is utilizing NextGen technologies to create a shared order fulfillment and last mile delivery platform for small-to-mid-size retailers.\n\nTo learn more about Procter & Gamble, visit http:\/\/www.pg.com. \n\nTo learn more about the NextGen Supply Chain Awards, visit http:\/\/www.nextgensupplychainconference.com\/en\/NextGen-page.\n\nThe NextGen Supply Chain Conference is produced annually by Supply Chain Management Review and Peerless Media.\n\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"An ice cream company based in Brooklyn has issued a recall of all flavors of its soft serve ice cream and sorbet brand after two people who ate its vanilla chocolate flavor fell sick and were sent to the hospital, according to the company and health officials. The illnesses were possibly linked to listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause serious sickness in people 65 or older and miscarriages and premature births in pregnant women, health officials said.\n\nThe company, Real Kosher Ice Cream, said in a statement on Wednesday that it would immediately recall all six flavors of its Soft Serve on the Go Cups, packaged retail versions of soft serve ice cream and sorbet. Real Kosher notified all retailers that stock the brand, asking them to remove the products from shelves and freezers and dispose of them.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert on Thursday about a listeria outbreak that might be linked to Soft Serve on the Go Cups.\n\nIn its own statement updated Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration said that an investigation into the outbreak was \u201congoing.\u201d The recall, the agency said, affects 19 states and the District of Columbia where the products are distributed, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture tested samples of ice cream from the freezer of one of the sick people and found traces of a strain of listeria.\n\nOfficials are still trying to determine whether that strain is the same strain of listeria that caused the current outbreak, the F.D.A. said. So far, no deaths have been reported.\n\nListeria outbreaks in the United States are not a new phenomenon. In June, health officials investigated a multistate outbreak tied to leafy greens. Previous listeria outbreaks have most likely been caused by contaminated deli meat and cheeses and other retail ice cream brands, according to the C.D.C.\n\nIllness from listeria can occur within a few hours, or sometimes two to three days, after the consumption of contaminated food, health officials said. More severe symptoms, such as confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, can take three days to three months to develop.\n\nSoft Serve on the Go products are sold in clear plastic eight-ounce cups and come in six flavors, including vanilla chocolate, caramel and peanut butter ice cream, as well as strawberry mango sorbet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr. Klein said future versions of the products would be clearly marked with a label informing customers that they\u2019re safe to eat, once the company received guidance from health officials.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been in our facilities many times, they\u2019ve been in our offices, it\u2019s all guided,\u201d he said, referring to the officials.\n\nIn addition to Soft Serve on the Go, Real Kosher has seven other brands, including Klein\u2019s, its signature ice cream brand, and Chevra, a line of frozen pizzas, according to its website.","labels":[]}
{"text":"German supermarket chain Aldi said it was buying Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harvey's, which together operate 400 stores in the southern U.S.\nThe merger would make Aldi one of the country's largest supermarket chains.\nFederal officials and regulators have grown increasingly skeptical of supermarket mergers, fearing decreasing competition could further drive up food prices that soared during the pandemic.\nGerman supermarket giant Aldi said it plans to buy two southern U.S. chains, even as grocery mergers have come under scrutiny from government officials over potential costs to consumers.\nAldi said Wednesday that it was purchasing the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harvey\u2019s chains, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, acquiring a total of 400 stores. Together with planned store construction, the merger would bring the total number of Aldi stores in the U.S. to 2,400, the company said, making it one of the largest chains in the country.\n1\n\nThe announcement comes as the Federal Trade Commission is deciding whether to approve a merger of Kroger and Albertsons which together have 4,996 stores. On Wednesday, seven secretaries of state published a letter urging the FTC to block that deal over worries that it could reduce competition in the grocery business and give big players more power to raise prices.\n2\n \n\u201cOnce there is such consolidation in the market, many consumers will no longer have choice. Kroger-Albertsons will have no competitive incentive to bring down prices,\u201d the letter said. \u201cConsumers will be powerless to hold the company accountable to promises of keeping prices low.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also recently voiced concerns over competition in the grocery store business.\n\n\u201cJust four supermarket companies control over a third of the market nationwide. And it\u2019s even more concentrated at the local level, where consumers have had even fewer stores to choose from,\u201d Biden said in a speech at the White House last month. \u201cGroceries in consolidated markets will charge you more because you have nowhere else to shop.\u201d\n3\n\n\nThe FTC proposed new guidelines last month detailing how they will evaluate grocery store mergers, with an eye toward protecting consumers from price gouging, the same day the Department of Agriculture said it was launching a partnership with attorneys general from 31 states and Washington, D.C. to combat anti-competitive behavior by food companies.\n4\n5\n\nShoppers have felt the sting of soaring food prices since the pandemic hit. As of July, groceries were 23.7% more expensive than in February 2020, according to the Consumer Price Index.\n6\n While grocery inflation has subsided lately, prices haven\u2019t gone down much, squeezing household budgets and causing some to go hungry.

{"text":"Crypto investors got a rude awakening in August. After a period of relatively calm markets, major cryptocurrencies saw a significant selloff. Bitcoin lost more than 10% of its value within the span of a few days. \n\nAmong the factors being blamed for the most recent decline is the decision by Elon Musk's Space X to sell off a big chunk of its Bitcoin holdings \n[1]\n. But given its track record, Bitcoin's volatility will likely continue, and investors should buckle up. \n\nThough the factors driving each crypto crash are different, it can be helpful to remember a few established investing principles, like choosing how much of your overall portfolio should be invested in crypto and remembering why you invested in the first place.\n\nThe latest market shock is another jarring bump in the road for cryptocurrency, which has seen its value plummet since the highs of 2021. Here's a rundown of a few of the factors that have been driving uncertainty and volatility so far this year.\n\nWhat can cause a crypto crash?\nCrypto prices can be dramatically affected by major events, such as exchanges or coins crashing. They can also sink with higher interest rates, rising inflation and other macroeconomic factors that can affect how confident people feel investing their money in risky alternative assets.\n\nRegulatory factors and financial enforcement actions like those carried out by the SEC can also affect the market.\n\nAnd when prices fall rapidly, that can compound the pressure on the market by forcing some investors to free up cash so they can meet other obligations.\n\nIn the case of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 , the impact to the market was enormous. The FTX crash didn't just affect FTX, but also cryptocurrencies FTX heavily invested in (such as Solana) and firms FTX did business with. \n\nThe crypto exchange BlockFi, which received a line of credit from FTX.US and was set to be acquired by the company later in the year, froze withdrawals before filing for bankruptcy itself a few weeks after FTX did.\n\nHas crypto crashed before? \nYes, multiple times. For example, Bitcoin recorded a previous record high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, but by December 2018 was trading below $3,500. It reached an all-time high of about $69,000 in November 2021 and in the year since dropped by more than 75%.\n\nI\u2019m worried about keeping my crypto with an exchange. What should I do?\nConsider moving your digital assets to a separate crypto wallet. Most exchanges allow you to transfer assets to these wallets, which can be online (on a separate platform) or offline (on a thumb drive with added security features).\n\nWhat are the risks of buying crypto?\nWhen crypto is crashing, someone who's been intrigued from the sideline might think this is the time to get in and \"buy low.\" But while prices can recover \u2014 and have done so in the past \u2014 the recovery could take months or years.\n\nConditions might also get worse before they get better. Following a major crash, prices could also continue to go down for some time, especially if the event causes financial troubles for other exchanges or currencies.\n\nUnlike traditional financial exchanges, crypto markets don't have circuit breakers, which automatically pause trading when prices dive too quickly. This means prices could plunge much faster than traditional investments.\n\nAnother distinction between crypto and securities such as stocks is that crypto trades around the clock. If you're worried about swings in value, you might find it hard to sleep. \n\nThere's also a chance any given cryptocurrency could go to zero, or close to zero, following a massive sell-off. Such was the case with Terra and Luna.\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"A coalition of leading maritime companies led by Bibby Marine and with financial support from the UK plans to develop the first zero-emission electric Service Operation Vessel (eSOV) to be used to support the offshore wind and energy industry. It is the latest entrant in the race to develop the first zero-emission vessels with a focus on the offshore sector and the potential of using power at the wind farms to charge the ships.\n\nIn their application for the UK\u2019s Zero Emission Vessel Infrastructure (ZEVI) competition, the coalition points to the strong opportunities in the segment to support offshore wind operations. With the UK calling for 40 GW offshore wind energy in additional offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 expanding on the more than 10 GW already in operation, the group estimated that between 62 and 149 vessels will be required. They highlighted that all the UK-operating SOVs have so far been built aboard.\n\nThey are proposing a 295-foot vessel that would be primarily powered by electricity and batteries and have dual-fuel methanol-powered engines as backup. The ship will be ready for offshore charging and can recharge its batteries at night. \n\nThey expect that it will be possible to operate a two-week cycle onsite at an offshore wind farm emissions-free. Near shore the vessel will operate solely on battery power and also while onsite. For the long transits between the shore homeports and the farms, the vessel will use its engines and with methanol fuel, it would be possible to still reduce emissions by 90 percent versus fossil fuel operations. They noted in the application if offshore charging is not available, the vessel would use its methanol engines to recharge its batteries and would still achieve a 50 percent reduction in emissions compared to a conventional SOV.\n\nDNV, which is one of the members of the coalition notes, \u201cThe number of fully electric and hybrid vessels will surge over the next few years, and continuing development on these technologies will be a key part of the maritime industry\u2019s transition to a zero-carbon future.\u201d\n\nBibby, which is leading the effort notes the vessel will be a natural progression in its decarbonization effort and the first new vessel for Bibby Marine in five years. \n\nIt was one of five projects that was announced today at London International Shipping Week as a winner in the UK Government\u2019s competition designed to support the development of new zero-emission maritime technologies. Under the rules of the competition, the vessel needs to be in service by 2025.  \n\nThey are estimating a cost of $37.5 million for the project with the UK government awarding them $25 million in funding. The project participants include Bibby Marine, Port of Aberdeen, Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, Kongsberg, DNV, Shell, and Liverpool John Moores University.\n\nIn the previous rounds of the funding competition, the UK has also awarded support to projects seeking to develop the technology required to provide offshore recharging capabilities. It has been highlighted that one of the challenges is the increasing distance from shore for the location of the wind farms, making onsite recharging critical. The UK projects are one of several looking at offshore recharging and creating vessels that are fully electric or use other technologies to be zero-emission ships.","labels":[]}

{"text":"Akira ransomware targets Cisco VPNs to breach organizations\nBy Bill Toulas \nAugust 22, 2023 09:00 AM 0\nHacker\n\nThere's mounting evidence that Akira ransomware targets Cisco VPN (virtual private network) products as an attack vector to breach corporate networks, steal, and eventually encrypt data.\n\nAkira ransomware is a relatively new ransomware operation launched in March 2023, with the group later adding a Linux encryptor to target VMware ESXi virtual machines.\n\n\nCisco VPN solutions are widely adopted across many industries to provide secure, encrypted data transmission between users and corporate networks, typically used by remotely working employees.\n\nReportedly, Akira has been using compromised Cisco VPN accounts to breach corporate networks without needing to drop additional backdoors or set up persistence mechanisms that could give them away.\n\nAkira targets Cisco VPNs\nSophos first noted Akira's abuse of VPN accounts in May, when researchers stated that the ransomware gang breached a network using \"VPN access using Single Factor authentication.\"\n\nHowever, an incident responder, known as 'Aura,' shared further information on Twitter on how they responded to multiple Akira incidents that were conducted using Cisco VPN accounts that weren't protected by multi-factor authentication.\n\nAura tweet\n\nIn a conversation with BleepingComputer, Aura stated that due to the lack of logging in Cisco ASA, it remained unclear if Akira brute-forced the VPN account credentials or if they bought them on dark web markets.\n\nA SentinelOne report shared privately with BleepingComputer and focusing on the same attack method presents the possibility of Akira exploiting an unknown vulnerability in Cisco VPN software that might be able to bypass authentication in the absence of MFA.\n\nSentinelOne found evidence of Akira using Cisco VPN gateways in leaked data posted on the group's extortion page and observed Cisco VPN-related traits in at least eight cases, indicating this is part of an ongoing attack strategy by the ransomware gang.\n\nCisco VPN trait seen in eight Akira attacks\nCisco VPN trait seen in eight Akira attacks\nSource: SentinelOne\nRemote RustDesk access\nAdditionally, SentinelOne's analysts observed Akira using the RustDesk open-source remote access tool to navigate compromised networks, making them the first ransomware group known to abuse the software.\n\n\nBecause RustDesk is a legitimate tool, its presence is unlikely to raise any alarms, so it can offer stealthy remote access to breached computers.\n\nOther benefits that arise from using RustDesk include:\n\nCross-platform operation on Windows, macOS, and Linux, covering Akira's full targeting range.\nP2P connections are encrypted and hence less likely to be flagged by network traffic monitoring tools.\nSupports file transfer which can facilitate data exfiltration, streamlining Akira's toolkit.\nOther TTPs observed by SentinelOne in Akira's latest attacks include SQL database access and manipulation, disabling firewalls and enabling RDP, disabling LSA Protection, and disabling Windows Defender.\n\nThese not-so-subtle changes are performed after the attackers establish their presence in the environment and are ready to proceed to the final phases of their attack.\n\nIn late June 2023, Avast released a free decryptor for Akira ransomware. However, the threat actors have patched their encryptors since then, and Avast's tool will only help victims of older versions.\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"Amazon violated labor law in advance of unionization elections last year at two warehouses on Staten Island, a federal administrative judge has ruled.\n\nThe judge, who hears cases for the National Labor Relations Board, ruled on Monday that Amazon supervisors had illegally threatened to withhold wage and benefit increases from employees at the warehouses if they voted to unionize. The judge, Benjamin W. Green, also ruled that Amazon had illegally removed posts on a digital message board from an employee inviting co-workers to sign a petition being circulated by the Amazon Labor Union. The union sought to represent workers at both warehouses.\n\nThe ruling ordered Amazon to stop the unfair labor practices and to post a notice saying it would not engage in them.\n\nIn the same ruling, the judge dismissed several accusations brought in a complaint by the labor board\u2019s prosecutors, including charges that Amazon indicated take-home pay would fall if workers unionized; that Amazon promised improvements in a program that subsidizes workers\u2019 educational expenses if they chose not to unionize; and that Amazon indicated that workers would be fired if they unionized and failed to pay union dues.\n\nThe judge found that these accusations were either overstated or, in the final instance, that the action was not illegal.\n\nAmazon can appeal the ruling to the labor board in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that the judge dismissed 19 \u2014 nearly all \u2014 of the allegations in this case,\u201d Mary Kate Paradis, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement, adding: \u201cThe facts continue to show that the teams in our buildings work hard to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe union declined to comment.\n\nThe violations occurred at a vast Amazon warehouse known as JFK8, where workers voted to unionize in an election whose results were announced in April, and at a smaller, nearby warehouse known as LDJ5, where workers voted down a union the next month.\n\nIn the weeks before the elections, Amazon summoned employees at the warehouses to dozens of anti-union meetings at which supervisors questioned the credibility of the Amazon Labor Union, emphasized the costliness of union dues and warned that workers could end up worse off under a union.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling set aside a broader question brought by labor board prosecutors: whether employers can force workers to attend such meetings.\n\nThe meetings are legal under labor board precedent and common among employers facing union campaigns. But the board\u2019s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, has argued that the precedent is in tension with federal labor law and had sought to challenge it.\n\nJudge Green concluded that he lacked the authority to overturn the precedent. \u201cI am required to apply current law,\u201d he wrote. Ms. Abruzzo\u2019s office can file an appeal asking the labor board in Washington to overturn the precedent.","labels":[]}
{"text":"This year, hotel sales experienced a steep decline statewide, according to Atlas Hospitality Group, which recently released its midyear 2023 California sales report. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a record number decline,\u201d said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, who\u2019s been tracking California hotel sales for more than 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of percentage drop.\u201d\n\nStatewide, sales decreased 53% during the first half of the year.\n\nReay said he sees numerous similarities between now and 2009. \n\nBut, what\u2019s even more interesting about this year\u2019s dramatic decline in sales is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily square with how hotels are doing, a marked contrast with 2009, when the U.S. was coming out of the Great Recession.\n\n\nMost hotels \u2013 specifically in Southern California \u2013 have recovered from all the residual impacts of Covid-19 in terms of an operational standpoint, with revenue and occupancy rates having generally returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cThe big cause of this decline is the rapid increase in interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cThe one word that would sum it up is \u2018disconnect.\u2019\u201d\n\nReay said the disconnect exists between the expectations of buyers and sellers \u2013 the prices that sellers are looking for are just not comparable with the cost buyers must pay for loans.\n\nThis has resulted in an uptick in the notice of default filings and foreclosures, as well as borrowers simply handing keys back to their lenders.\n\n\u201cI would call this an interest rate-driven downturn,\u201d Reay said, noting that despite numerous similarities to 2009, we are not in a recession now because the operational side of the hotel industry is performing relatively well. \n\nLos Angeles hotel sales\n\nIn Los Angeles County, only 17 hotels were sold in the first six months of the year compared to 36 in the same period last year. That\u2019s a decline of 53%, the same percentage drop as the state.\n\nLikewise, of those transactions, the number of rooms that sold last year was 2,894, as opposed to the 1,315 in the first six months of this year, a 55% decrease. Also, the median price per room declined by 13% this year.\n\nYet, last year the total sales price was $808,259,906, whereas this year the total sales price was $1,008,790,000, a 25% increase. \n\nIn addition, the average price per room this year is up 16% year over year, further illustrating the disconnect between the expectations of buyers and sellers. \n\nAnd beyond high interest rates, Measure ULA \u2013 the one-time real estate transfer tax unique to L.A. city properties valued at or above $5 million that went into effect on April 1 \u2013 has hit the L.A. hotel scene hard, with many owners delaying selling.\n\nIn the second quarter of last year, L.A. experienced 20 hotel sales priced above $5 million. In that same period this year, the only hotel sale the city of L.A. had above $5 million was the $760 million foreclosure sale of the Fairmont Century Plaza, a 394-room luxury hotel located in Century City, by the Reuben Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhat you have unique to Los Angeles is not only this huge decline in sales because of interest rates,\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s compounded by the fact that you now have the mansion tax and owners are really holding off on selling.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reay, as long as interest rates remain at their current levels there will be more pressure on sellers and lenders to adjust their price expectations downward.

Credit: William Widmer\/Redux \/ eyevine\nCancer and chemicals in Reserve, Louisiana: the science explained\nRead more\nThe move marks a significant escalation of the Biden administration\u2019s enforcement action in the Cancer Alley region, and was instantly hailed by members of the predominantly Black community around the plant as a major victory in their ongoing campaign for clean air.\n\nSuing on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the justice department is now seeking a federal court order to compel Denka (DPE), the Japanese chemical giant operating the facility, to \u201cimmediately take all necessary measures\u201d to curb emissions of the compound chloroprene, labeled by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen.\n\nThe facility is the only site in the US to emit the compound, which is a primary constituent of the synthetic rubber neoprene. EPA air monitoring around the facility has consistently shown readings well in excess of the recommended lifetime exposure limit of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\n\u201cThis will have a tremendous impact on our struggle here,\u201d said Robert Taylor, a founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish. \u201cOver the six years we have been fighting this fight we haven\u2019t had anything as great as this to happen in terms of getting concrete action on emissions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Taylor added: \u201cThe state government has totally ignored us \u2013 marches on the capitol, rallying \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t even give us an audience. And for the administration to come in and do this, it just validates our efforts.\u201d\n\nEPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that he had promised \u201cstrong action\u201d for community members during a site visit to Reserve in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThis complaint filed against Denka delivers on that promise,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThe company has not moved far enough or fast enough to reduce emissions or ensure the safety of the surrounding community. This action is not the first step we have taken to reduce risks to the people living in St John the Baptist Parish, and it will not be the last.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by Denka on Tuesday said the company \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the legal action and urged the EPA to re-evaluate its findings on chloroprene exposure. The company has been lobbying the federal government for years, claiming the compound\u2019s peer-reviewed classification is based on outdated science.\n\n\u201cDPE is in compliance with its air permits and applicable law. EPA is taking an unprecedented step \u2013 deviating from its permitting and rulemaking authorities \u2013 to allege an \u2018emergency\u2019 based on outdated and erroneous science the agency released over 12 years ago,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe lawsuit also names a subsidiary of the US chemicals giant DuPont, which constructed the Pontchartrain Works facility as a neoprene plant and operated it for over half a century.\n\nDuPont sold the plant to Denka in 2015 in a secretive deal, which the Guardian later revealed was motivated by concerns from DuPont that it would face heavier regulation after the EPA\u2019s decision to classify chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen. The revelations were part of a years-long Guardian series examining air pollution in Reserve and throughout Cancer Alley.\n\nDuPont remains the owner of the land beneath Denka\u2019s facility and acts as a landlord, according to the complaint, meaning DuPont may need to grant permissions in order for emissions to be reduced.\n\nDuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, associate attorney general Vanita Gupta said: \u201cThe justice department\u2019s environmental justice efforts require ensuring that every community, no matter its demographics, can breathe clean air and drink clean water. Our suit aims to stop Denka\u2019s dangerous pollution.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit contains further details of the plant\u2019s recent chloroprene emissions, which fell after Denka constructed emissions offset technology after its purchase of the plant, but still remains dangerously high and in some locations 14 times over the recommended exposure limit.\n\nAccording to EPA calculations in the suit, current chloroprene emissions present a risk \u201cthat is especially grave for infants and children under the age of 16\u201d. The suit claims that emissions remain so high that a child breathing air near certain monitors around the facility\u2019s fence line would exceed their lifetime excess cancer risk within two years.\n\nEither they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPA\nMary Hampton of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish\n\u201cIn the aggregate, the thousands of people breathing this air are incurring a significantly higher cancer risk than would be typically allowed, and they are being exposed to a much greater cancer risk from Denka\u2019s air pollution than the majority of United States residents face,\u201d the suit states.\n\nThe justice department complaint does not directly specify that Denka should reduce its emissions to the 0.2 micrograms lifetime exposure recommendation, but cites the guidance throughout the complaint.\n\nMary Hampton, another founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish, said the lawsuit was the culmination of years of advocacy from community members and represented that \u201cfinally we have a little hope\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis makes me feel like we have something to look forward to, not five or 10 years from now \u2013 we need it to happen now.\u201d\n\nHampton urged both Denka and DuPont to comply with the federal government\u2019s demands set forth in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThey know they can comply,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cAnd either they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPA.\u201d","labels":[]}

{"text":"Boycotts against corporate inclusion of LGBTQ+ Americans are targeting more major businesses.\nBud Light, in particular, has taken a big financial hit over its partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\nWhile no other company has faced as severe a fallout, the backlash wave has started to jeopardize inclusion that had become commonplace in recent years.\nCracks have even started to show at some of the locations of Starbucks, which has a more liberal reputation than Anheuser-Busch does.\n\nIllustration by Gene Kim\nAttacks against businesses for their inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community have forced companies to try to strike a balance between expressing values or risking backlash \u2014 and even violence \u2014 from a small but vocal part of their customer bases.\n\nAs boycotts move beyond social media-fueled outrage, companies such as Anheuser-Busch\n, Target\n and Disney\n are facing monthslong public relations fiascos that have resulted in market share losses, C-suite shake-ups, legal battles and even threats to employees. In some cases, corporations have drawn the ire of conservative customers for marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or criticizing laws targeting them \u2014 only to face backlash from more liberal shoppers for attempts to appease those who spurned a brand.\n\nBoycotts usually have little effect on a company\u2019s bottom line, according to experts who have tracked them. The backlash against Bud Light has hit particularly hard because there are similar substitutes for the light lager, constant media coverage has emboldened the boycotters, and the company has not put forth a unified strategy, said Anson Frericks, who spent more than a decade as president of sales and distribution at Anheuser-Busch.\n\nFor companies such as Target and Disney, it is unclear if boycotts will hit sales. Even if companies take no financial damage from the backlash, the increasingly aggressive resistance to LGBTQ+ marketing has jeopardized corporate-inclusion efforts that have become commonplace in recent years.\n\nThe backlash wave across the country, which has disproportionately targeted transgender people, has even weighed on large companies with more liberal reputations. The union representing Starbucks\n baristas said dozens of the chain\u2019s locations are not letting employees decorate for Pride Month in June \u2014 including at least one case where workers were told violence in response to Target\u2019s Pride merchandise sparked safety concerns.

{"text":"TOYOTA CITY, Japan, Sept 19 (Reuters) - At factories in Japan's industrial heartland, Toyota (7203.T) has turned to self-propelled assembly lines, massive die casting and even old-fashioned hand polishing as it aims to make up for lost ground in battery electric vehicles.\n\nThe world's top-selling automaker believes it can close the gap with Tesla (TSLA.O) and others by combining new technology with the famous lean production methods it has used for decades to wring inefficiency, including excess costs, out of manufacturing.\n\nThe automaker gave a glimpse of its latest advances at a plant tour in central Japan last week, some for the first time. It also showed off examples of thrifty ingenuity, such as a technique to make high-gloss bumpers without any paint. The mold is hand polished to a mirror finish, giving the bumper its lustre.\n\nElsewhere, three-decade-old equipment used to process parts can now be run at night and on weekends after being automated through robotics and 3D modeling, improvements Toyota said had trebled equipment productivity.\n\n\"The strength of Toyota's manufacturing lies in our ability to respond to changing times,\" Chief Product Officer Kazuaki Shingo told reporters on the tour.\n\nHe pointed to engineering and technology expertise anchored in \"TPS\", shorthand for the Toyota Production System.\n\nToyota revolutionised modern manufacturing with its system of lean production, just-in-time delivery and \"kanban\" workflow organisation. Its methods have since been adopted everywhere from hospitals to software firms and studied widely in business schools and boardrooms around the world.\n\nThe relentless focus on continuous improvement and squeezing costs helped fuel Toyota's ascent from post-war upstart to global giant. But in battery EVs, it has been eclipsed by another tireless innovator, Tesla, which has used efficiencies of its own to build market-leading profitability.\n\nUnder new CEO Koji Sato, Toyota in June announced an ambitious plan to ramp up battery EVs, a big shift after years of criticism that the maker of the industry-leading hybrid Prius was slow to embrace fully electric technology.\n\nThe Japanese automaker accounted for only about 0.3% of the global EV market in 2022, Goldman Sachs said in June, calling a stronger offering the \"missing piece\" in its lineup.\n\nIt is not the only car company grappling with the challenges from shifting to EVs. Detroit's Big Three automakers have cited competitive pressure from Tesla as they push back against wage demands from the United Auto Workers union that last week led to an unprecedented simultaneous strike.\n\nASSEMBLY LINE, GIGACASTING\nOne innovation being emphasised by Toyota is its self-propelled production lines, where EVs are guided by sensors through the assembly line. The technology removes the need for conveyor equipment, a major expense in the car assembly process, and allows for greater flexibility in production lines.\n\nIn a demonstration, EVs inched along without a roof, allowing parts to be slotted in. A Fanuc (6954.T) robot arm lowered cars seats into the EV bed. Nearby, an autonomous forklift took more seats off a container.\n\nToyota also showed off a prototype of the die-casting technology known as \"gigacasting\" pioneered by Tesla that produces aluminium parts far bigger than anything used before in auto manufacturing.\n\nLike Tesla, Toyota says it will produce EVs in modular sections, reducing parts. But it also points to innovations of its own. Since it has been working with die-casting for years, it has developed molds that can be quickly replaced, which is periodically necessary in gigacasting.\n\nToyota says that reduces the time to change the mold to 20 minutes, versus 24 hours normally. It estimates a 20% boost in productivity.\n\nThe automaker has also introduced a self-driving transport robot at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City that ferries new vehicles across a 40,000 square metre (10 acre) parking lot, a job typically done by drivers before loading cars onto carrier trucks.\n\nTruck drivers walk on average 8 km (5 miles) a day fetching cars, eating into driving time and adding to the physical burden in a job where turnover is high.\n\nThe automaker said it aims to have 10 of the robots operating in Motomachi by next year and will consider other plants after. It could also sell the robots to other companies.\n\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"For Jason Fellows, of Idaho, sustainability is not just a buzzword. It is a way of life for the farmer with a deep-rooted connection to the land that shapes the legacy he envisions for generations to come.\n\n\u201cSustainability is the key thing that helps people through the future,\u201d Jason said. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t focused on sustainability, we wouldn\u2019t have things that are there for our kids or their kids.\u201d\n\nJason and his brother have been stewards of their piece of Idaho for years, and their commitment to sustainability led them to embark on a unique project, Beaver Dam Analogs (BDAs).\n\n\u201cA BDA is a Beaver Dam Analog,\u201d Jason explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a man-made beaver dam designed to mimic the function of a natural beaver dam. The purpose of a BDA is to slow down water in a creek, allowing the water to seep into the soil and improve the land\u2019s hydrology.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, the Fellows noticed a decline in stream flow on their property. It was a concerning trend that led them to reminisce about days past when beavers inhabited the creek, and their presence had a positive impact on water retention.\n\nThe brothers decided to install BDAs in their creek to address the issue, aiming to replicate the beaver\u2019s natural water management.\n\n\u201cOur goal in doing the Beaver Dam Analog projects was to make our place more sustainable,\u201d Jason said.\n\nThis innovative approach to water management proved to be prophetic during a year with a high snowpack and intense runoff. The BDAs, filled with sediment, showcased their effectiveness in preventing soil erosion and maintaining creek stability. In contrast, other creeks in the area without BDAs experienced significant erosion and deepened channels.\n\nBDAs conserve water as well as foster biodiversity. Riparian areas along riverbanks where water dissipates are critical for wildlife. Beaver presence in these areas\u2014or the implementation of BDAs\u2014significantly reduces the risk of wildfires, as they remain moist and act as natural firebreaks.\n\nHowever, while implementing this man-made fix was vital, Fellows also recognized the larger goal of the project as a way to attract beavers back to the area.\n\n\u201cThe big thing about a BDA is you want to attract a beaver back in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have a pool of water where a beaver feels safe, the beaver won\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nFor Fellows and his fellow farmers and ranchers, sustainability is not an abstract concept. It is a daily practice rooted in the land and its future.\n\n\u201cAs farmers and ranchers, we focus on providing for future generations and taking care of the land,\u201d Fellows said.","labels":[]}

{"text":"Major Dental Insurer MCNA Dental Suffers Devastating Ransomware Attack\nJune 13, 2023\n\nMCNA Dental, a major US dental health insurance provider, was hit by a suspected ransomware attack in one of the largest health data breaches of 2023. The breach exposed over nine million Americans' personal data, raising concerns about data security and fraud. \n\nAtlanta-based MCNA Dental, known for serving government-sponsored programs for children and elders, revealed that a hacker had accessed their computer system between February 26 and March 7, 2023.\n\nThe attacker viewed and copied patients' names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, government-issued ID numbers, health insurance plans, Medicaid IDs, bills, and claim data. \n\nThe Maine attorney general informed 8.9 million MCNA Dental clients of the incident. Following another large data loss at PharMerica, this event highlights the healthcare sector's alarming vulnerability to personal data breaches. \n\nOn May 3, 2023, approximately two months after the cyberattack, MCNA Dental completed its investigation of the incident. However, the corporation has not provided any information about the breach, leaving affected parties unsure and concerned. \n\nWhen MCNA Dental refused to pay the $10 million ransom, LockBit ransomware claimed responsibility. LockBit boldly leaked 700GB of exfiltrated data on their dark web leak site. This example shows how ransomware groups intimidate and coerce enterprises into complying. \n\nSince September 2019, the Russian-linked ransomware gang LockBit has been operating.

{"text":"lockchain Capital\u2019s Bart Stephens Lost $6.3 Million In SIM-Swap Crypto Hack\nIain Martin\n\nAug 21, 2023,10:59am EDT\nBlockchain Capital cofounder Bart Stephens has filed a lawsuit after losing $6.3 million of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to an anonymous hacker in a so-called SIM-swap attack.\nBlockchain Capital cofounder Bart Stephens has filed a lawsuit after losing $6.3 million of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to an anonymous hacker in a so-called SIM-swap attack.SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE VIA GETTY IMAGES\nBart Stephens, cofounder and managing partner of crypto fund Blockchain Capital who was an early and prominent evangelist for cryptocurrencies, has filed a lawsuit against an anonymous hacker who stole $6.3 million of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies from his digital wallets.\n\n\nStephens alleges that the hacker, who is identified only as Jane Doe, used personal information available online and on the dark web to bypass security checks with his cellular network provider and change account passwords in May. The hacker ordered a new cell phone after seizing control of his cellular network account, and then ported Stephen\u2019s private cell number to a SIM in the new device, according to a lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16.\n\nThis exploit is known as a SIM-swap attack, which the Federal Bureau of Investigations warned in 2022 were increasingly common and targeted at victims who were likely to own large amounts of cryptocurrency. The FBI estimates that $72 million was stolen in SIM-swap attacks last year, up from $68 million in 2021.\n\nStephens founded Blockchain Capital in 2013 with his brother Brad Stephens. The San Francisco-based fund has since gone on to back crypto startups like Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and NFT exchange Opensea. Blockchain Capital\u2019s Twitter account was hacked earlier this month to promote a crypto token, according to Cointelegraph.\n\nStephens\u2019 lawsuit claims that the hacker used his cell phone number to reset passwords, and pass two factor authentication tests, at several unnamed digital wallets and then \u201cbegan to systematically steal plaintiff's digital assets.\u201d\n\nA day before the hacker moved $6.3 million to their private crypto wallets, they wrote to Stephens to brag that they could \u201cremotely hack anyone\u2019s phone number in the mainland U.S.\u201d in a message sent from one of his own hacked accounts to his work email.\n\nThe hacker also tried to steal bitcoin and ethereum worth $14 million from a \u201ccustodial cold wallet\u201d owned by Stephens but were blocked by a Blockchain Capital employee who had been notified of the withdrawal. \u201cThis notification was the first time that Plaintiff learned that Plaintiff\u2019s [redacted] account was under attack,\u201d Stephens\u2019 attorney wrote in the lawsuit.\n\n\nStephens\u2019 cell phone network only confirmed on May 15, a day after the funds were stolen, that he had been the victim of a SIM-swap attack. Around half of the funds were moved to cryptocurrency tumbler exchanges that mix digital assets which can help anonymise transactions, and make tracing stolen bitcoin and other coins harder. Stephens did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSIM-swap attacks typically rely on hackers manipulating or \u201csocial engineering,\u201d tricking cell phone network customer service operators into revealing personal information about a victim. The hacker then uses that information to pass security tests needed to port a victim\u2019s phone number to a new SIM card and phone in their control.\n\nIn one of the largest SIM-swap attacks to date, Florida man Nicholas Truglia was sentenced to 18 months in jail in December 2022 for the theft of over $20 million from crypto investors including Transform Ventures\u2019 Michael Terpin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStephens has long been an outspoken proponent of crypto and a foil to critics like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has repeatedly dismissed bitcoin as a fraud. \u201cI would encourage Jamie Dimon and others to do some homework first. It is not a fraud. It is not a Ponzi scheme. It\u2019s a robust technology that is going to impact multiple industries,\u201d Stephens told CNBC in 2017.\n\nSend me a secure tip. \nIain Martin\n\n","labels":[]}

With more than 11,000 employees, Atlassian is \u201cthe largest company in the world committed to distributed work at this scale,\u201d she said.\n\nRemote collaboration with periodic in-person gatherings boosts productivity and allows the Australian-founded software company to recruit better talent, Dean said. More than half of the people hired during the last year live over two hours from an office, she said.\n\nAlso holding out against the return-to-office movement is Airbnb Inc., which has said its roughly 6,000 employees can work from anywhere with regular meet-ups structured around product releases. Software company Twilio Inc. has no office-return rules for its 6,400 employees \u2014 about 60% of its workforce is in locations where the firm historically hasn\u2019t had offices, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lawson said in a March interview.

{"text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 UBS will pay U.S. authorities $1.44 billion to settle the last lingering legal case over Wall Street\u2019s role in the housing bubble of the early 2000s, which ultimately led to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nThe Swiss bank agreed to pay a civil penalty over how it handled the sale of 40 mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007. The settlement argues that UBS bankers gave false and misleading statements about the health of the mortgages in those bonds to the buyers in violation of federal securities law.\n\nFor example, UBS bankers knew that the underlying mortgages in these bonds were poorly underwritten or violated consumer protection laws. The bonds in question ended up with substantial losses for investors.\n\nWith the UBS settlement, the last remaining outstanding legal case from the Great Recession has now come to a close, the Justice Department said. Banks paid collectively more than $36 billion in civil penalties for their conduct related to the mortgage crisis, but that does not include other settlements that banks have made to state and local authorities as well.\n\nUBS said that it already had set aside funds for the settlement, so it will not impact its financial results.\n\nSeparately Monday, Swiss media reported that two groups acting on behalf of Credit Suisse shareholders filed suit in Swiss courts to argue that the sale price to UBS \u2013 around $3.25 billion \u2013 far undervalued the bank, and that UBS was able to unjustly profit from the deal.\n\nThe Swiss government hastily arranged the takeover in March of Credit Suisse, which had been facing years of turmoil and an exodus of shareholders, by longtime rival UBS to help avert a global financial crisis.\n\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"Home  Americas\nUS Begins Probe Into Chinese Cyberattack On Joe Biden Admin\u2019s Emails; Hackers Expose Porous Security Gaps\nBy NC Bipindra -August 16, 2023\n\n\nMultiple American security agencies have begun a probe into a serious breach allegedly by a Chinese hackers group into Joe Biden administration\u2019s email accounts supplied by American software giant Microsoft, raising the alarm over sensitive information from those emails that may have fallen into foreign hands.\n\nWhile the US Congress launched an investigation into recent cyber espionage campaigns allegedly linked to China that led to the successful breach of several government email accounts within the State and Commerce departments earlier this month, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) too tasked its Cyber Safety Review Board to go into the cloud security and examine the recent cyberattack that targeted government email accounts, the US-based Nextgov\/FCW reported.\n\nThe DHS\u2019s Cyber Safety Review Board, composed of 15 cybersecurity leaders across the public and private sectors, will probe how threat actors target cloud computing environments for malicious purposes. The review will also assess how Lapsus$, a hacking group reportedly linked to China, leveraged a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Online to access unclassified government emails in the cyberattack.\n\nThe cyberattack was described by a senior Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) official as a \u201csurgical campaign\u201d targeting a \u201csmall number of mailboxes.\u201d DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, on the other hand, described cloud security as \u201cthe backbone of some of our most critical systems\u201d in a statement announcing the new review on August 11.\n\n\u201cOrganizations of all kinds are increasingly reliant on cloud computing to deliver services to the American people, which makes it imperative that we understand the vulnerabilities of that technology,\u201d Mayorkas said.\n\nThe Cyber Safety Review Board, which does not have regulatory authority, will aim to develop best practices that software providers and cloud users across sectors can employ to bolster network security.\n\nUS Congress Seeks Probe\nThe announcement comes after calls from Congress for federal investigations into the cyberattack, including from Democrat Senator Ron Wyden, who urged CISA and the attorney general to take action against Microsoft related to allegations of negligent cybersecurity practices he asserted in a letter last month. \u201cGovernment emails were stolen because Microsoft committed another error,\u201d Wyden wrote in his letter.\n\nWyden was happy over the DHS Cyber Safety Review Board announcing the investigation. \u201cHad the Board studied the 2020 SolarWinds hack, as President Biden originally directed, its findings might have been able to shore up federal cybersecurity in time to stop hackers from exploiting a similar vulnerability in the most recent incident.\n\nThe government will only be able to protect federal systems against cyberattacks by getting to the bottom of what went wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\nWyden noted in his July letter that the Cyber Safety Review Board was established in response to the 2020 SolarWinds hack but never delivered on a probe of the breach, and Microsoft\u2019s role in it, despite the lawmaker\u2019s urging.\n\n\u201cI have repeatedly pushed CISA and DHS to direct the Board to study the SolarWinds incident but have been rebuffed. Had that review taken place, it is quite likely that Microsoft\u2019s poor data security practices around encryption keys would have come to light, and this most recent incident might have been averted,\u201d Wyden wrote.\n\nLapsus$ Investigations\nThe DHS Cyber Safety Review Board had on August 10 released its report on Lapsus$, which was found to have \u201cleveraged simple techniques to evade industry-standard security tools\u201d and avoid detection while accessing critical networks.\n\nAccording to the report, cybercriminals like Lapsus$ used techniques like phishing employees and stealing cell phone numbers to gain access to proprietary data. The review featured ten actionable recommendations that government agencies, companies, and others can employ to bolster cyber defenses against Lapsus$ and other threat actors.\n\nThe report said standard multi-factor authentication techniques featured critical vulnerabilities that left major companies susceptible to cyber intrusions. \u201cLapsus$ and related threat actors are using basic techniques to gain an entry point into companies,\u201d Rosa Smothers, a government relations executive at the security firm KnowBe4 and former CIA cyber threat analyst, was quoted by Nextgov\/FCW.\n\n\u201cTheir primary attack vectors \u2013 SIM swap attacks and phishing employees \u2013 can be easily addressed, especially for companies like Microsoft and Okta that are so well resourced.\u201d The Board recommended organizations \u201cimmediately switch to more secure, easy-to-use, password-less solutions by design\u201d and called on the government to develop a \u201csecure authentication roadmap\u201d that helps accelerate the adoption of password-less authentication.\n\nCSRB Chair and DHS Under Secretary for Policy, Robert Silvers, said the review \u201cuncovered deficiencies in how companies ensure their vendors\u2019 security; how cell phone carriers protect their customers from SIM swapping; and how organizations authenticate users on their systems. \u201cThe board examined how a loosely organized group of hackers, some of them teenagers, were consistently able to break into the most well-defended companies in the world,\u201d Silvers said.\n\nUS Congress Seeks Cyber Espionage Briefing After Microsoft Letter\nThe US Congress, Nextgov\/FCW reported on August 2, launched an investigation into recent cyber espionage campaigns allegedly linked to China that successfully breached several government email accounts within the State and Commerce departments.\n\nIn separate letters to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Republican leaders of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability requested briefings from both officials on the discovery, impact, and response to the intrusions.\n\nRepresentational Image\nRepresentational Image\nOn its part, Microsoft previously released a report that said a China-based cybercriminal gained access to an unspecified number of unclassified government email accounts through forged authentication tokens and a flaw in its cloud-computing environment that has since been patched.\n\nThe letters note that the breach began on May 15 \u201cand operated in stealth for more than a month\u201d before Microsoft began its investigation into the espionage campaign.\n\n\u201cChina appears to be graduating from \u2018smash and grab heists\u2019 that used to be \u2018noisy\u2019 and \u2018rudimentary\u2019 to a level described by security experts as \u2018among the most technically sophisticated and stealthy ever discovered,'\u201d the letters said.\n\n\u201cThe incident even raises the possibility that Chinese hackers may be able to access high-level computer networks and remain undetected for months if not years.\u201d\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters in July that the agency \u201ctook immediate steps to secure our systems\u201d and notified Microsoft of the breach. However, he declined to specify the date the intrusion was detected. Miller also declined to indicate whether the breach was connected with Secretary Blinken\u2019s recent trip to China.\n\nThe intrusions have been associated with a China-based actor known as Storm-0558. According to Microsoft, the cyberattack accessed email accounts at approximately 25 separate organizations through the company\u2019s Outlook Web Access in Exchange Online and Outlook.com. \u201cThis type of espionage-motivated adversary seeks to abuse credentials and gain access to data residing in sensitive systems,\u201d Microsoft said in an announcement about the hack.\n\nThe letters also note that the hack further underscores a warning about China included in the National Cybersecurity Strategy released earlier this year, which calls the country \u201cthe broadest, most active, and most persistent threat to both government and private sector networks.\u201d\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, separately, wrote to the heads of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and CISA on July 27 to request a probe into Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity practices that, he says, facilitated the espionage campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first espionage operation in which a foreign government hacked the emails of United States government agencies by stealing encryption keys and forging Microsoft credentials,\u201d Wyden noted in his letter.\n\nThe lawmaker detailed multiple problems with the company\u2019s methods of securing encryption keys and said, \u201cthat these flaws were not detected raises questions about what other serious cybersecurity defects these auditors also missed.\u201d\n\nCISA Outlines New Cybersecurity Strategic Plan\nEarlier this month, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it prioritizes addressing immediate threats, hardening digital terrain, and implementing security at scale, among nine other objectives outlined in its new Cybersecurity Strategic Plan.\n\nReleased on August 4, the plan marks CISA\u2019s roadmap for the next three years as the agency works with the Biden administration to safeguard America\u2019s digital networks from the increased onslaught of malicious cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cNow is the moment where our country has a choice: to invest in a future where collaboration is a default rather than an exception; where innovation in defense and resilience dramatically outpaces that of those seeking to do us harm; and where the burden of cybersecurity is allocated toward those who are most able to bear it,\u201d the executive summary of the report reads. \u201cCyber incidents have caused too much harm to too many American organizations. Working together, we can change this course.\u201d\n\nThe nine objectives underpinning the strategy and its three overarching goals include prioritizing coordinated threat disclosure, proactive vulnerability analyses, and implementing cybersecurity investments, among other tenants.\n\nThe plan will focus on outcome-based measures for institutions working to reduce their cybersecurity risk. Some of these metrics are centered around reducing incident response time, particularly for federal agencies and critical infrastructure partners.\n\nOther metrics focus on strategic increases. In measuring the efficacy of agency collaborations, CISA is focused on analyzing the increases in the volume of relevant information, in addition to more specific actionable plans and post-incident reports. Notably, the strategy also focuses on implementing the federally-backed secure-by-design concept.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we can no longer accept a model where every technology product is vulnerable the moment it is released and where the overwhelming burden for security lies with individual organizations and users,\u201d the report reads. \u201cTechnology should be designed, developed, and tested to minimize the number of exploitable flaws before they are introduced to the market.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of federal mandates and legislation, tech companies still operate under a voluntary and trust-based collaboration model. CISA \u201cwill strive to ensure that regulators and other government entities with compulsory authorities leverage technically sound and effective practices developed together with our partners across the private sector, ideally enabling harmonization across both US and global regulatory regimes.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes that CISA will produce and regularly update criteria to develop and maintain secure-by-design products and ensure manufacturer cooperation.\n\nArtificial intelligence software and quantum computing are highlighted as potentially risky technologies that threaten current cybersecurity protocol, particularly with the coming of an operational quantum computer.\n\nCISA\u2019s strategy to mitigate these emerging threats is to work with the developers of these nascent technologies and prepare digital systems through post-quantum cryptographic migrations.","labels":[]}

Hire more domestic workers.\"\n\nDespite all the enthusiasm for quicker work permits, there's a lot of entrenched obstacles. The application process, for one, can be incredibly confusing. \"Not everyone understands how to navigate the immigration process as soon as they get here,\" says Conchita Cruz, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project.\n\nTake someone like Eddie \u2014 the Colombian migrant sitting under the highway overpass. He has a year to figure out how to submit an asylum application, which he says he finds daunting. He has to tackle that while also figuring out what he'll do in 60 days when he can no longer stay at a shelter. Given the current situation in New York, it's likely he'll have a hard time finding a lawyer to help him. \"That's what a lot of the backup is,\" says human rights law professor Susan Gzesh from the University of Chicago. \"The pro-bono panels are staffed. Nonprofits, all sorts of volunteers, are really at capacity.\"\n\nOnce Eddie applies, he has to wait another 150 days to submit a work permit application and then another 30 days to get approved.\n\nEddie is at the very least facing half a year without legal permission to work.\n\nThis is the norm, Cruz says. \"It does take at least six months, if not significantly longer, to get a work permit.\" That, she says, can have a massive impact on migrants themselves. \"A lot of the asylum-seekers who are coming to the United States are parents of young kids. They have a family to support. And work permits are not just a path to getting a job, but in the United States, they really unlock a number of things like a driver's license; the ability to access health care insurance \u2014 things that American citizens take for granted.\"\n\nThere is proposed legislation to expedite work permits for asylum-seekers. But experts say, Congress is just too divided to pass it.\n\nThat legislation wouldn't address one of the major problems in getting work permits approved quicker: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, funded by Congress, is completely backed up. \"They just don't have enough staff to do it,\" Cruz says. \"Some of these backlogs are now many years old. So they're backlogs that existed even before COVID. There was a huge slowdown in processing during the Trump administration. \"\n\nThere are also difficult questions around fairness, says Muzaffar Chishti, a director at the Migration Policy Institute. There are around 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., many who've been here for decades and have no way to get a work authorization. \"So to say these recent arrivals have more privilege than them, is an equity issue that is difficult to argue.\"\n\nIn a statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security said it continues to \"call on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nThere are, however, some things the president could do on his own. He could extend TPS \u2014 temporary protected status \u2014 to more people. That allows people to apply for work permits faster. He could grant humanitarian parole to more people, although his efforts to do so are currently on trial. And he could also tell Immigration Services to prioritize work permits.\n\nEven then, backlogs would be an issue.\n\nTaking any of these actions could be too much of a political hot potato, especially with an election on the horizon. \"I think that they are very cautious about doing anything that could be characterized as an incentive for more unauthorized migration,\" says professor Gzesh.\n\n\nThe application process for work authorization takes so long that many migrants have started working without papers, at high-risk, low-pay jobs like food delivery.\nJasmine Garsd\/NPR\nMeanwhile, without the ability to legally work, many migrants are being pushed into the underground economy. Angel, from Venezuela, is also hoping to apply for asylum. He asked that his last name be withheld. One reason: He's renting out someone's identity, so that he can work delivering food. He says he asked around for work \"but they ask you for a Social Security number, an ID, so many things I don't have. So I just rent an account out and can work in peace. It's the most logical move for people like us, without papers.\"\n\nAngel works around 12 hours a day. A significant portion of what he makes goes to the person he rents his online profile from. What's left is not a lot. It goes mostly to his family back home.\n\nIt's better than nothing \u2014 but barely enough.","labels":[]}

{"text":"Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles (EVs) \u2013 full battery-electric vehicles \u2013 were sold in the U.S. in Q2, a record for any quarter and an increase of 48.4% from Q2 2022. Tesla, again, was the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., with more than 175,000 sold, an increase of 34.8% quarter over quarter. Sales growth at Tesla, and the EV segment overall, was aided by sizeable price cuts by some automakers (Tesla, really) and incentive levels well above the industry average. In June, the average price paid for an EV was down nearly 20% year over year. EV share of the U.S. market in Q2 was 7.2%, up from 5.7% a year ago and down from the high in Q1 of an upwardly revised 7.3%.\n\nTesla is the No. 1 seller of luxury vehicles in the U.S., but its share of EV sales continues to fizzle. In Q2, Tesla\u2019s share fell below 60% for the first time, but the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S. \u2013 Chevrolet \u2013 is a distant second. Tesla outsold Chevrolet 10 to 1 in Q2. Ford and Hyundai are third and fourth behind Chevrolet. Newcomer Rivian had a good quarter, with more than 20,000 units sold. Tesla\u2019s success, in many ways, is the Model Y, the leading EV in America. One of every three EVs sold last quarter was a Tesla Model Y. Add in the similar-sized Model 3, and those two products are half the electric vehicle business. The once-leading Model S is no longer the best-selling high-end EV. Sales last quarter were estimated at 5,257, down more than 40% year over year and well behind the newcomer: BMW i4 EV sedan, with 6,777 sales in Q2, the new boss when it comes to super-lux EV sedans.\n\nEV sales growth and filling the gaps in infrastructure to support EV mobility continue to be the industry\u2019s leading story. Cox Automotive expects the country to welcome 1 million new EVs to its roads in 2023, which will fuel the budding used EV market further. Sparked in part by government incentives, new battery production facilities are cropping up around the country, and factories are being retooled and rethought to support EV production. This fall, the United Auto Workers are negotiating their labor contracts with many automakers, and one topic is front and center: EVs. Even vehicle transportation and logistics \u2013 the trucking of EVs \u2013 is being redesigned in some part, as the current crop of EVs is heavier and harder to move than their ICE brethren.\n\nAnd EV sales keep growing.\n\nIn a recent Cox Automotive survey, more than 50% of shoppers were interested in adding an EV to their stable. Being interested is easy, of course, but far fewer people actually buy. And in the same survey, 53% of consumers agreed that EVs will eventually replace traditional ICE-powered vehicles. Dealers were more cautious, with only 31% agreeing on an all-EV future. Dealers have a front-row seat to the many challenges ahead. And many dealers, recently, have been watching EV inventory building.\n\nIn late June 2023, the days\u2019 supply of EVs was over 100, whereas industry-wide inventory levels were closer to 53 days. When it comes to EV sales, the market is likely heading into its Trough of Disillusionment (hat tip to the Gartner Hype Cycle), where collaboration across many parties will be necessary to push through. Building EVs is one thing, and many in the industry are proving excellent at that skill. Selling EVs is something different altogether. Yes, EV sales records will continue to be set, and EV growth will continue to outpace overall industry growth, but the days of 75% year-over-year growth are in the rearview mirror. The hard-growth days are ahead.","labels":[]}
{"text":"New York\nCNN\n \u2014 \nBoeing reported a $650 million operating loss in the fourth quarter, surprising Wall Street analysts who had expected the aircraft giant to turn a profit.\n\nThe company blamed the unexpected loss on \u201cabnormal production costs\u201d as it tried both to deliver the remaining backlog of 737 Max jets and to step up deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners. The company\u2019s production of the 787 remains below normal rates.\n\n\u201cWe continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines \u2026 as we run into supply chain shortfalls,\u201d CEO Dave Calhoun told investors Wednesday. \u201cSo those stoppages, while they are coming down, are not where they need to be.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Boeing had to shell out an unspecified amount of compensation to 787 customers whose deliveries were delayed by about a year.\n\nThe company also warned Wednesday that it will post a loss in the current quarter, although it did not give a range. That\u2019s a disappointment, as analysts have been forecasting the Boeing would report a narrow profit for the quarter.\n\nShares of Boeing (BA) were down more than 3% in late morning trading after that guidance.\n\nBoeing has reported only two profitable quarters in the nearly four years since the grounding of the 737 Max. After two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, the jet was grounded for 20 months starting in March 2019. Then a year later, the pandemic brought demand for flying and new aircraft to a near halt \u2014 sparking the cancellation of hundreds of jet orders and the pileup of losses for Boeing.\n\nStill, the industry has shown signs of picking up, and analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast that Boeing would earn 26 cents a share. Instead it reported a loss of $1.75 a share. So while that\u2019s an improvement from the loss of $7.69 a share in the fourth quarter of of 2021, it\u2019s also another big disappointment.\n\nA difficult few years\nBoeing\u2019s problems in the fourth quarter are tied to its difficult few years since the 737 Max crisis.\n\nFor one, the company was saddled with excess inventory of hundreds of the jets. Usually Boeing doesn\u2019t hold onto inventory, as planes are delivered to customers soon after completion.\n\nBut even though the 737 Max jets couldn\u2019t be delivered during the grounding, Boeing kept building them \u2014 partly to keep its suppliers in business. Then it was forced to find new buyers for some of those planes due to customers canceling orders during the pandemic.\n\nBeyond the Max, the FAA flagged quality problems with the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliners that stopped it from delivering that model. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still affected the company: Much of Boeing\u2019s abnormal production costs last quarter were a result of having to rework both the Max and Dreamliner jets, CEO Dave Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday.\n\nThe supply chain problems are improving, Calhoun added, but they are not behind the company or the aerospace industry as a whole, He suggested more money-losing quarters may be ahead despite a rebound in demand, saying he expects Boeing to have \u201cbouncy\u201d margins throughout the year as its Max and Dreamliner inventories are cleared.\n\nBoeing delivered 152 commercial jets in the quarter, up 54% from a year ago and better than its own target.\n\nBut digging deeper into the financial results highlights a potential problem: It appears Boeing received lower prices on some of its planes than analysts had expected.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company\u2019s revenue fell short of forecasts, coming in at just below $20 billion. While it was Boeing\u2019s highest revenue figure since the start of the pandemic, it was about $360 million less than analysts\u2019 consensus estimate. The combination of better-than-expected deliveries but worse-than-forecast revenue suggests that weaker pricing.\n\n\u2018Focused on driving stability\u2019\nBoeing tried to put the best spin possible on its disappointing results.\n\nThe company pointed out that this was the first full year of positive operating cash flow since the start of the 737 Max crisis. Boeing finally brought in $3.5 billion more cash than it spent, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 of positive operating cash flow of between $4.5 bililon to $6.5 billion.\n\n\u201cDemand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond,\u201d said Calhoun in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWhile challenges remain, we are well positioned and are on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength.\u201d","labels":[]}

And this was a high pressure process \u2013 AB InBev wanted to close as quickly as possible and the deal carried a $3bn break fee, the largest ever negotiated.\n\nAlongside this we had to devise a unique transaction structure to take into account numerous considerations including AB InBev and SABMiller\u2019s corporate objectives, shareholder priorities (including obtaining tax-free treatment for SABMiller shareholders who wanted to receive equity as part of the transaction) and transactional taxes (such as stamp duties), together with UK and Belgian law and applicable regulatory rules.\n\nCreating a narrative\nExecuting a deal of this size required a clear strategy and meticulous preparation.\n\nTo make the regulatory approvals process as smooth as possible, we worked with AB InBev\u2019s PR and financial advisers to craft a narrative that explained the deal\u2019s benefits for investors, regulators, consumers and the market.\n\nWe also oversaw AB InBev\u2019s web, video and social media strategies to ensure all communications were consistent with regulatory filings and UK and Belgian rules.\n\nPrint\n Share\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n US\nEnglish\nUS English\n\n\nView the infographic: the deal in numbers\n\nPDF, 133.24KB\n\n\nAB InBev: the deal explained\n\nAnnounce carousel\n\nAnticipating the remedies\nOur antitrust strategy documented the precise order in which the filings needed to be made around the world.\n\nWe then established a centrally co-ordinated global team (comprising our lawyers and leading practitioners from more than 80 national firms) to implement the plan. \n\nWe assessed what remedies would be needed to avoid prolonged investigations in key jurisdictions and pre-negotiated the sales of assets in multiple countries. The most significant remedy packages were devised with AB InBev before it had even approached SABMiller, to ensure the smoothest possible path for the transaction.\n\nWe also proactively dealt with public interest concerns, for example in South Africa where AB InBev agreed a set of public interest commitments with the Minister of Economic Development. These included a secondary listing for the combined group on the Johannesburg stock exchange, development initiatives, local investment and a continued commitment to SABMiller's broad-based black economic empowerment scheme.\n\nManaging shareholders, planning strategy\nThe novel structure combined an offer and merger process in Belgium with a UK scheme of arrangement. We also created a new holding company, listed in Belgium, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.\n\nTo manage the competing demands of SABMiller's shareholders, we designed a bespoke, unlisted security in the combined company that is convertible to ordinary shares after five years. The amount of securities offered was capped to limit dilution of the AB InBev shareholders and help all parties achieve their ambitions.\n\nThroughout the deal we acted as strategic advisers to the AB InBev board, leading them through the legal challenges across the world and helping plan the strategy for negotiations with SABMiller.\n\nThese became particularly tense when, as completion drew near, the UK's Brexit vote led to a sharp decline in sterling that ultimately required AB InBev to increase its offer.\n\nOpening up opportunities\nThe deal enabled AB InBev to establish itself as a genuinely global brewer and one of the world's biggest consumer products companies.\n\nWhile it was already the no. 1 brewer by sales, AB InBev has now acquired valuable assets in key emerging regions with strong growth prospects such as Africa, Asia and Central and South America. It will be able to provide more choices for beer drinkers in new and existing markets.\n\nThis transformative transaction was executed in just 13 months.

And consumers can help to build that awareness and momentum too.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Minderoo Foundation report, the American Chemistry Council\u2019s (ACC) vice president of plastics, Joshua Baca said the report was \u201cdesigned to generate headlines\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with its characterizations and claims about our industry,\u201d he added.","labels":[]}
{"text":"OpenAI is trying to dismiss various claims in two legal actions launched by authors and comedians, who sued the machine-learning super-lab for scraping their books to train ChatGPT without explicit permission. \n\nIn June, novelists Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in the US over its harvesting of prose. Days later, comedian Sarah Silverman and novelists Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey also sued the biz. Both parties accused the ChatGPT maker of copyright infringement for ingesting their work to train the chatbot.\n\nOpenAI's lawyers have hit back, asking a federal court in San Francisco to dismiss five out six claims brought by Tremblay and Awad, those being: vicarious infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unfair competition, negligence, and unjust enrichment. It is, however, prepared to fight the first claim of direct copyright infringement in hope of winning it to make a point to any other creative person considering pursuing it.\n\nOpenAI made the same argument against Silverman et al's federal lawsuit, too, for what it's worth.\n\n\n\n\"This motion does not seek dismissal of Count I, for direct copyright infringement, which OpenAI will seek to resolve as a matter of law at a later stage of the case,\" the lab's legal eagles argued in court filings [PDF]. The lawyers believe most of the plaintiffs' accusations do not describe any actual law-breaking by OpenAI, and rest allegedly involve the biz directly infringing on the writers' intellectual property \u2013 allegations the organization denies. \n\nLawyers for the AI biz argued OpenAI has not violated copyright laws at all and that ChatGPT is protected under fair use. US copyright law states that \"transformative uses\" of work \u2013 where the original source is repurposed \u2013 is considered fair use. Although the large language model ingested the authors and comedian's books, it transformed their text for different applications. That's the argument, anyway. \n\n\"According to the complaints, every single ChatGPT output \u2013 from a simple response to a question (e.g., 'Yes'), to the name of the president of the United States, to a paragraph describing the plot, themes, and significance of Homer's The Iliad \u2013 is necessarily an infringing 'derivative work' of plaintiffs' books,\" they wrote in the court docs.\n\n\"Worse still, each of those outputs would simultaneously be an infringing derivative of each of the millions of other individual works contained in the training corpus \u2013 regardless of whether there are any similarities between the output and the training works. That is not how copyright law works,\" they concluded.\n\nAI and copyright is a contentious legal gray area. Similar lawsuits have been filed by visual artists, who claim companies like Stability AI have trained text-to-image models on their artwork. Although the US Copyright Office has declared that works which are \"not the product of human authorship\" cannot be protected, officials are unsure about other issues.\n\nThe office issued a request for public comment [PDF] this week on copyright law and policy issues raised by AI.\n\nThe Register has asked the plaintiffs' lawyers for comment.","labels":[]}

On the other side of the Atlantic, no worker will be earning less than $15 (\u00a311.50) an hour \u2013 double the federal minimum. Here, the minimum has been raised by 28% for workers in London and 18% for those in the rest of the UK.\n\nForget the idea that this is an act of philanthropy from Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. To be sure, it could be said that a company boasting record profits can afford to pay its workers a decent wage \u2013 particularly when large numbers of them in the US can only make ends meet on government food stamps \u2013 but that is not the way businesses are run.\n\nJeff Bezos\n\nNor does the move have anything to do with Philip Hammond\u2019s threat to impose a unilateral digital sales tax on companies such as Amazon in the absence of a global deal to force them to pay more. That, as Amazon well knows, is unlikely to happen.\n\nWhat\u2019s really happened is that Amazon has been squeezed from two directions at once. On the one hand, it has been taking serious stick from some high-profile enemies. In the US, this has included an unlikely alliance of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. In the UK, the company has come under fire from the GMB union and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon is struggling to fill vacancies as the labour market tightens. In Britain and the US, unemployment is about 4%, meaning workers \u2013 even deunionised workers \u2013 have more freedom to change job if they are unhappy. And, to say the least, Amazon is not a model employer.\n\nBezos put it this way: \u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead.\u201d That\u2019s not quite the full story. Certainly, it is smart of Amazon to move early so it can recruit and retain staff ahead of the busy Christmas period.\n\nBut the decision also disproves the idea that multinational companies are now so powerful they can do pretty much as they wish. Workers will be getting higher wages because of strong campaigning, skilful PR and the channelling of populist anger.\n\nA clash between Brussels and Rome was inevitable from the moment the Five Star Movement and the League formed a government in Italy in early June. It was only a question of time before populism in the shape of higher public spending and a rising budget deficit ran up against the EU\u2019s fiscal conservatism, and so it has proved.\n\nIn the past few days, Italy has published a budget that was bound to infuriate Brussels, because it involved more borrowing in each of the next three years and a widening of the structural deficit \u2013 the bit that is unaffected by the ups and downs of the economy. Rising to the bait, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that unless Italy backed down, it threatened the future of the single currency. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, has told Juncker to get lost.\n\nA man wearing a hat bearing the stars of the EU\nA pro-EU demonstrator at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. Photograph: Darren Staples\/Reuters\nThe EU has to be careful with Italy, which is not just the third biggest economy in the eurozone, but one with a fragile banking system. Matters are coming to a head just as negotiations between Britain and the EU enter a critical phase, but it would be a mistake to imagine the prospect of Italy becoming a new and bigger Greece would mean Theresa May will get an easier ride.\n\nFrom the outset, the EU has been determined to avoid any other country following Britain\u2019s example. That explains why its negotiator, Michel Barnier, has stuck firmly to his mandate. If Brussels now softened its approach simply because it feared another euro crisis then that would send out the wrong signals. Italy has been flirting with the prospect of leaving the euro and Brussels will want to make that option look as difficult and as scary as possible by hanging tough with the UK.","labels":[]}
{"text":"All that cost-cutting at Amazon might be paying off. The company isn\u2019t back to the torrid growth of bygone days but managed to beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter rose 11 percent to $134.4 billion, the retailer said, better than the 9 percent it was achieving recently. That was about $3 billion more than analysts had been forecasting.\n\nNet income was 65 cents a share versus expectations of 35 cents. Last year, the company lost 20 cents a share in the quarter because of a slump in the value of its investment in Rivian, the electric truck maker.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call that the results were helped by reconfiguring the company\u2019s delivery network to put merchandise closer to buyers.\n\n\u201cWhen shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which costs less in transportation, get there faster and is better for the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of goodness in that equation.\u201d\n\nAmazon shares rose more than 10 percent after the earnings were announced. Traders also liked that the company estimated third-quarter revenue would increase 9 to 13 percent and operating income would double. The third quarter includes special annual sale days that usually boost revenue.\n\nJuly signified two years since Mr. Jassy took over as chief executive from Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder. Mr. Jassy\u2019s stewardship so far has been a period of retrenchment. Amazon flourished during the pandemic, supplying necessities and diversions to millions of suddenly grounded families, and the retailer made the reasonable assumption that the boom would last.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. There were layoffs and cutbacks last winter, a time when many big tech companies consolidated swollen operations. The stock fell sharply in 2022 after years of growth. It has since recovered much of the loss but is still below its peak.\n\nSome analysts have worried that Amazon\u2019s recent desire to keep expenses down clashes with its longstanding obsession over making customers happy.\n\nTom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson, wrote a note last week to investors about several disappointments he had experienced with Amazon, including no longer being able to have a defective product picked up without cost by UPS. Now, he wrote, there is a $7.99 fee.\n\n\u201cIn our view, Amazon is playing a \u2018game of chicken\u2019 and banking on other e-commerce companies not to offer a superior service, instead of its historical approach of working backwards with a customer-obsessed approach,\u201d Mr. Forte wrote.\n\nOne of Mr. Bezos\u2019 last major actions before his departure was to add \u201cStrive to be Earth\u2019s best employer\u201d to the company\u2019s leadership principles. \u201cLeaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered?\u201d the principle states.\n\nThe first Amazon union was formed at a warehouse in Staten Island last year, but the company has refused to negotiate with it and is challenging its validity. The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Amazon in July for refusing to bargain. Meanwhile, employees\u2019 return to the office post-pandemic has been unusually contentious for the company.\n\nEmployment appears to have stabilized. Slightly fewer than 1.5 million people work for the company, down 4 percent from a year ago and flat from the prior quarter.\n\nAmazon is so large, with over half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, that it is difficult to move the needle much. In earlier years, the retail division grew like gangbusters. Then the AWS cloud division provided the supercharged growth, and finally advertising pushed the numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see where the next phase of growth will come from. AWS is growing at about a 12 percent annual rate, while online stores were up 4 percent and advertising 22 percent.\n\nMost new programs, like this week\u2019s roll out of grocery service for customers who are not Prime club members, are incremental. Non-Prime members will pay higher delivery fees.\n\nIf the second quarter at Amazon was relatively quiet, the current quarter is likely to produce more in the way of headlines. The Federal Trade Commission is widely expected to file a lawsuit against the company accusing it of violating antitrust laws. A resolution could be years away.","labels":[]}
{"text":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Christopher Kubasik, CEO of L3Harris Technologies, said Jan. 27 regulators continue to review the company\u2019s proposed $4.7 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and expects the merger to close in 2023.\n\nL3Harris, headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, is a global defense and aerospace firm with more than $17 billion in annual revenue. In December it announced an agreement to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne, a California-based manufacturer of rocket engines and propulsion systems for space vehicles, ballistic missiles and military tactical weapons. \n\nDuring a fourth-quarter earnings call, Kubasik said the company has been answering questions from Federal Trade Commission antitrust regulators. He said L3Harris executives have met with Pentagon officials to address questions on the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and its potential impact on defense programs. \n\nKubasik did not comment on a recent letter sent by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to the Federal Trade Commission urging the agency to block the transaction. The FTC last year blocked Lockheed Martin\u2019s proposed $4.4 billion bid for Aerojet Rocketdyne, arguing that the combination would give Lockheed \u2014 a major supplier of tactical missiles \u2014 the ability to \u201ccut off other defense contractors from the critical components they need to build competing missiles.\u201d\n\nL3Harris said it does not expect to face these same challenges because the combination with Aerojet would be a \u201chorizontal move\u201d rather than a vertical integration of a missile manufacturer and a key supplier of propulsion systems. \n\nIf the acquisition is approved, Kubasik said, there are no plans to close major facilities but he estimates about $50 million in overhead cost savings during the first year. \u201cWe both have offices in D.C. We both have offices in Huntsville. There\u2019s some low hanging fruit there,\u201d he said. \n\nThis would be L3Harris\u2019 second of two back-to-back acquisitions. Earlier this month the company closed a nearly $2 billion purchase of Viasat\u2019s tactical data links business. \n\n\u201cWe got TDL done in 92 days, and the integration is already underway, so we can focus on getting Aerojet Rocketdyne approved, and then start the integration,\u201d said Kubasik.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t foresee us doing any acquisitions for a couple of years, as you would imagine,\u201d he told analysts. \u201cThere\u2019s some non-core assets that we\u2019re going to sell, and we\u2019re going to use those proceeds to bring down our debt over the next few years.\u201d","labels":[]}
{"text":"Horizon Blockchain Bridge Latest Crypto Hack Victim, $100 Million Stolen\nSCOTT IKEDA\u00b7JUNE 30, 2022\nUnited States-based blockchain bridge Horizon, a service that links Ethereum with the Harmony decentralized blockchain platform, is the latest project to fall victim to a crypto hack.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe blockchain bridge was hit for about $100 million in cryptocurrency as the attackers potentially exploited a signature vulnerability that outside security researchers had been warning about on social media for months. Harmony has not yet released any information about the actual cause of the breach, and the Horizon bridge remains closed as the company remediates the issue.\n\nBlockchain bridge latest in string of high-dollar attacks on Ethereum services\nHarmony has multiple blockchain bridges to different types of currencies; the crypto hack appears to have only impacted the bridge to Ethereum, lending some credence to the theory that a proposed vulnerability circulating on Twitter since at least early April was exploited.\n\nWhile Harmony has yet to comment on exactly what caused the crypto hack, a June 23 tweet from the company fingered a wallet address that the hackers apparently used to process the stolen funds (made up of a variety of crypto asset types) and convert everything to Ethereum. A June 27 update from the company indicated that the hackers were moving the stolen funds through Tornado Cash to anonymize them and that Harmony was working with the FBI and two outside security firms in an investigation of the incident. The company has also offered a $1 million bounty with a promise of no criminal charges if the funds are returned.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Horizon blockchain bridge was closed on June 23 as part of this investigation and remains down as it proceeds. The company is issuing updates on the situation via Twitter.\n\nThe incident follows the biggest attack to date on a decentralized finance platform (and one of the largest overall crypto thefts in history), the March theft of $600 million from popular NFT game Axie Infinity. There has been something of a trend of attacks on defi services in the past year, with a growing perception that they have lax security and are open to both code-based exploits and social engineering approaches. A February attack on the Wormhole bridge netted $325 million in stolen funds; about $10 billion was stolen in crypto hacks of defi platforms in 2021, and some analysts project this number going up by at least several billion by the time 2022 comes to a close.\n\nDid the Horizon crypto hack stem from a vulnerability identified on Twitter?\nThe potential flaw in the blockchain bridge, articulated on Twitter by user \u201cApe Dev,\u201d points out that the entire system relies on a wallet that authorizes transactions that has four owners. Two of the four signers are all that is needed to authorize a transaction. The crypto hackers may have compromised two of these accounts through a variety of means such as obtaining private keys by breaching a hardware security module (HSM), or finding an exploit in the validation code. There is also always the possibility of it being an inside job, or the credentials to two of the necessary signature accounts being found in a breach elsewhere.\n\nDefi in general has become a popular target for crypto hacks due to a long string of security lapses, but blockchain bridges are of particular interest to attackers as they store substantial amounts of crypto token liquidity to facilitate the cross chain transfers of funds. Attackers can tap directly into these funds and abscond quickly, as happened in this case.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe string of defi crypto hacks in recent months has cast a light on fundamental security shortcomings of the entire enterprise. These platforms are not subject to regulations, do not have to provide transparency to users about how funds and protocols are secured, and are not really held to exacting security standards by anything other than the possibility of losing a large amount of money to a breach. Defi platforms that fall victim to a hack or scam are often reduced to offering a \u201cbounty\u201d of the sort that Harmony is offering to recover the stolen funds, a strategy that has proven to rarely work.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHarmony\u2019s own ONE token dropped 12% in the immediate wake of news of the breach, and has continued on a slight downward trend since. The token had already been struggling with the general crash in crypto of recent months, currently down to $0.0228 from a peak value of 0.38 in early January.\n\n#Blockchain bridge was hit for about $100M in #crypto hack as attackers potentially exploited a signature vulnerability that #security researchers had been warning about on Twitter for months. #respectdata\nClick to Tweet\nBlockchain bridges will almost certainly remain popular targets for crypto hackers until, at minimum, the industry moves to better standard trustless models and invites reputable third party security audits. Nick Percoco, Chief Security Officer of Kraken, expands on what will be needed going forward if defi platforms are to shake their reputation as a risky place to park funds and assets: \u201cHigh profile attacks, such as this one, continue to reinforce the importance of the broader crypto ecosystem prioritizing a security-first mindset and remaining vigilant. Criminals constantly search for new attack vectors and vulnerabilities, which means that security protocols need to be consistently invested in and updated. We anticipate the spotlight on this event will focus the minds of cyber security teams across the blockchain ecosystem and will result in more robust protocols moving forward.\u201d\n\n \n","labels":[]}

Net sales declined 8% during the period to $5.13 billion. Brick-and-mortar store sales also declined 8% over the year-ago period. \n\nDespite lagging sales, Macy\u2019s did manage to beat analyst expectations. However, the retailer\u2019s declining sales are signs of deeper problems, according to Neil Saunders, managing director at retail research firm GlobalData.\n\n\u201cEffort, imagination, creativity, and determination are needed to turn Macy\u2019s around. Sadly, these are qualities that Macy\u2019s has traditionally lacked, so it remains debatable as to whether a revival can be engineered,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nMacy\u2019s is No. 17  in the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of North America\u2019s online retailers by web sales.\n\nConsumer spending declined\nMuch of the sales slump can be blamed on broader economic trends, says Macy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette in a transcript via Seeking Alpha.\n\n\u201cOver the last several quarters, we have seen Macy\u2019s customers more aggressively pull back on spending in our discretionary categories,\u201d he says.\n\nAbout half of Macy\u2019s customers have annual household incomes of $75,000 or less, and those customers are cutting spending and shifting priorities toward experiences over goods.\n\nThere may be a deeper problem, though. Sales are 7.5% lower than they were in Q2 of 2019.\n\nMacy\u2019s sales decline is \u201csignificantly worse than the overall market,\u201d Saunders says. \u201cThis puts the better performance achieved during the pandemic years into perspective: Macy\u2019s was a beneficiary of circumstance rather than the author of its success.

{"text":"n August, Bloomberg reported what we at the Human Rights Foundation already knew: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was sending in bots to attack our award-winning Uyghur Forced Labor Checker to deter you from downloading it and discovering the truth behind where your clothes are made and, more importantly, who makes them.\n\nThat's what our Google plug-in does\u2014it lets you know when your shopping cart might be filled with items made by one of the 1.5 million Uyghurs the CCP has forced into concentration camps and asks you to think twice about your purchases.\n\nThat dress you're pining over from New York Fashion Week? It was made by a 16-year-old girl whose family doesn't know where she is or if she is even alive. That T-shirt Gigi Hadid wore on the runway? Made by a man in his 50s who has been tortured, raped, and is under constant surveillance. That coat you saw someone wearing to the afterparty? Made by a woman who used to be a teacher but is now being forced to eliminate her identity as a Uyghur Muslim.\n\n\nThe Uyghur people have their own language, their own culture, and their own identity distinct from the Han Chinese. The CCP is trying to erase their identity, and they're doing so by subjecting them to political indoctrination and grave human rights abuses. They are \"reeducated\" and made to learn Mandarin Chinese. They are forced to have abortions, use intrauterine devices, and receive sterilizations. And they are mandated to work non-stop with little to no pay. Most notably, picking cotton and working in clothing factories.\n\nThe CCP doesn't want you to know these things. In fact, they do everything in their power to ensure you don't by silencing activists and persecuting their families. The first and most obvious reason is that they're trying to eliminate the entire Uyghur population and want to do so without any backlash. And the second is that they have ties to major Western fashion brands, and they don't want that to change.\n\nDo you see the connecting thread?\n\nOne in five pieces of cotton clothing worldwide is linked to Uyghur forced labor. Either Uyghurs were forced to pick the raw material, the cotton, or they cut the fabric and made the clothes that you are wearing.\n\nFast fashion brands like Shein, Nike, Zara, and many others, meanwhile, have been in the spotlight due to their use of Uyghur forced labor. Consumers have boycotted these brands. They have been ridiculed on social media and in the news. And mass protests have occurred to raise awareness of their supply chain.\n\nBut you will likely see a Uyghur original on the runway in New York this week. That's because high-end and luxury brands have, for the most part, gone under the radar when it comes to cotton picked by forced labor\u2014until now.\n\nThe luxury fashion industry is no stranger to mishaps, criticism, or scandals. But when it comes to forced labor, they're trying to skirt responsibility\u2014even as brand representatives insist it won't be \"tolerated.\" They simultaneously admit when pressed they don't source their own raw materials. So how could they possibly know where it comes from?\n\nBlissful ignorance is appalling when lives are at risk.\n\nDemocratic governments worldwide have called the CCP's actions a genocide. But their responses and efforts have been lackluster. The U.S. enacted the only legislation in the world that addresses this issue: the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The UFLPA was enacted in 2022 and prohibits goods produced in the Uyghur region from being sold in the U.S. unless there's clear and convincing evidence that they weren't picked by slaves.\n\nYet clothes made by Uyghurs continue to be sold in the U.S. en masse. There's practically a Zara on every block in New York City. Moreover, for an individual shipment to trigger the reporting requirement, the amount has to exceed $800. So that $200 Shein order you just bought won't get flagged.\n\nThis means it's entirely up to you, the consumer, to demand to know where and how your clothes are made.\n\nDon't be fooled by the pretty colors, sparkles, or the newest trend unveiled during New York Fashion Week. It's not enough to live by your values; you must wear them, too. Lives depend on it.\n\n","labels":[]}

In fact, the reality is they were just lucky,\u201d he tells Global News.\n\nTsai says that Shopify \u201cmiscalculated\u201d the trajectory of growth for e-commerce during its hot streak in the pandemic, which saw business boom while consumers were stuck at home and businesses were forced to open online shops to survive.\n\nCEO Tobi Lutke conceded in a letter announcing the first round of layoffs in July that Shopify\u2019s bet on sustained e-commerce growth during the pandemic \u201cdidn\u2019t pay off.\u201d He took the blame for the need to cut jobs at the time.\n\nMore recently, the company has underestimated the downside for its business amid an economic slowdown, Tsai argues.\n\nSpecifically, he says consumers are likely to rein in spending and avoid making more online purchases as a possible recession  looms on the horizon \u2014 and that\u2019s bad news for Shopify.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances have changed. They are proving that they misjudged the situation and they have to prove that they\u2019re adaptable and have to quickly, rapidly evolve if they want to stay in business,\u201d he says.\n\nAnalysts cheer sale of logistics business\nIn an open letter Thursday announcing the cuts, Lutke said the company \u201cis changing the shape of Shopify significantly today to pay unshared attention to our mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize the crushing impact this decision has on some of you, and did not make this decision lightly,\u201d Lutke wrote.\n\nThe chief executive said Shopify had a number of \u201cside quests\u201d that had begun to \u201csplit focus,\u201d and so the company has been \u201csubtracting everything\u201d over the past year to make sure it was as focused as possible on its primary mission.\n\nIn that vein, Lutke said the company has also decided to sell Shopify Logistics to Flexport, a supply chain management company, to help the business become more ambitious and global in nature.\n\nFlexport will also become the official logistics partner for Shopify.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, but is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approval.\n\nThe sale, a reversal of its strategy of aggressively investing in fulfillment networks, was well-received by analysts.\n\n\u201cOver the course of one earnings release, Shopify completely shifted its investor positioning to be a balanced-growth and profitable company,\u201d William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau said.\n\n\u201cThey can have the best of both worlds \u2013 a logistics business that makes them competitive with Amazon without having to manage a business that is not core to Shopify and had been losing money,\u201d said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.\n\n\u201cCombined with the reduction in force, management is showing its commitment to profitability which investors had been concerned about.\u201d\n\nWhile the headcount reductions and divestiture of the logistics business might boost Shopify\u2019s share price and investor confidence in the company\u2019s profitability, Tsai says the latest quick pivot in the business means the ups and downs might not be over yet for Shopify.\n\n\u201cI think we just have to keep an eye on this roller coaster. If things could get worse before they get better for this company,\u201d he says.\n\nShopify's next big bet\nLutke also hinted that the company will lean further into artificial intelligence in the future, calling AI a possible \u201ccopilot for entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at the dawn of the AI era and the new capabilities that are unlocked by that are unprecedented. Shopify has the privilege of being amongst the companies with the best chances of using AI to help our customers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFinkelstein talked on the earnings call Thursday about some of the customer-facing uses the company has already rolled out with artificial intelligence, including an AI shopping assistant launched in March to help consumers search the internet for the products they\u2019re interested in and buy them right in the app.\n\nHe also said AI tools to help merchants write product descriptions will allow business owners to spend less time on the minutiae of the business and more time refining their products.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are in the early innings of unlocking the true power of AI,\u201d Finkelstein said.\n\nBut Tsai says leaning into AI \u2014 a tempting step for tech companies looking to save money on human labour \u2014 can be a difficult balance to strike when it comes to customer service. Other tech giants have already replaced human reps with artificial intelligence, which he says has resulted in a more frustrating interface for many customers.\n\nShopify having real people to answer questions was a \u201cdifferentiator\u201d for them, Tsai says, and they may now lose that edge to competitors who keep a human touch for their services.\n\nThough he said Thursday marked a \u201chard day\u201d for Shopify, Finkelstein nonetheless expressed confidence in the leaner company moving forward.\n\nThe changes will leave Shopify with \u201cincredible talent density\u201d and the ability to executive on its goals at a \u201cmuch, much better speed, better pace and with better results,\u201d he told analysts Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more optimistic now than I think ever before about the future of this company,\u201d he said.","labels":[]}

The items will be distributed in the wake of natural disasters to nonprofits and other aid partners that quickly help communities impacted by hurricanes or other disasters. The Disaster Relief Hub is a dedicated space within Amazon\u2019s global logistics network to store and quickly pack items that are most-needed following damaging storms and other emergencies.\n\n\"As natural disasters increase in frequency and severity, we\u2019re expanding our Disaster Relief Hub in Atlanta, allowing us to deliver more items in less time during this year\u2019s hurricane season,\" said Abe Diaz, head of Amazon Disaster Relief. \"Since 2017, we\u2019ve responded to more than 100 natural disasters and humanitarian crises in the U.S. and across the world. We\u2019ve donated more than 23 million relief items, and we\u2019ve mobilized our teams and used our logistics capabilities to help communities in need\u2014from flying two cargo planes to T\u00fcrkiye after the recent earthquakes to setting up two humanitarian hubs in just 10 days to help Ukrainian refugees.\"\n\nAmazon works year-round with national and international relief organizations\u2014such as the American Red Cross, Save the Children, and World Central Kitchen\u2014to identify items that will most likely be needed after natural disasters. Data shows that more than 80% of the needed items are the same after each natural event.\n\nUsing such data and forecasts from relief organizations, Amazon teams are able to pack tens of thousands of relief items and have them ready to deploy as soon as it\u2019s safe following a natural disaster. Some of the most frequently requested products include diapers, tarps, cots, blankets, heaters, tents, solar lights and chargers, and cleaning supplies.\n\n\"We are extremely grateful for our collaboration with Amazon. During times of disaster, companies like Amazon enable the American Red Cross to carry out our mission and serve those in need. As we start another hurricane season, it is critical we have stocked warehouses and relief supplies to help at a moment\u2019s notice,\" said Dee Dixon, regional chief executive officer of the American Red Cross of Georgia. \"Amazon\u2019s donation and commitment to disaster relief and preparedness help the Red Cross respond to communities and families in need across the country.\"\n\nImproving disaster response through cloud technology\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is helping organizations use the power of cloud computing to improve disaster response. For example, AWS is working with the American Red Cross to better serve communities by innovating cloud computing-enabled solutions, including powering Alexa-enabled devices to receive hurricane alerts and to schedule blood donations.\n\nAWS also has a dedicated Disaster Response team that helps standby partners\u2014including relief organizations and nonprofits\u2014prepare for and respond to disasters globally with the cloud. This includes testing proof-of-concepts and fine-tuning existing innovations under simulated disaster conditions, with support from AWS Disaster Response vehicles. These vehicles are enabled with technology like AWS Snowball Edge devices, which are powerful and portable cloud computing devices designed for rugged deployments in the harshest physical environments.\n\nAWS has used cloud technology to help standby partners with mapping and damage assessment of hard-hit areas, re-establishing internet connectivity, and scaling call centers to handle increased requests after a disaster. The team also provides computing power for responding organizations in the field to process information on-site, enabling them to make faster decisions about where to focus response efforts.\n\nIn the past 18 months alone, Amazon has responded to major disasters and humanitarian crises across the world, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida, the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, as well as tornadoes, wildfires, and floods.\n\nTo learn more about Amazon disaster relief and response efforts, visit https:\/\/www.aboutamazon.com\/impact\/community\/disaster-relief\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20230601005336\/en\/","labels":[]}

{"text":"Los Angeles County has become the latest local government to accuse pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 the little-known middlemen of the prescription drug industry \u2014 of stoking the opioid crisis by helping flood the nation with highly addictive pills.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the county alleged that Express Scripts Inc. and OptumRx Inc. colluded with drug manufacturers to promote dangerously addictive opioids as a safe and moderate pain treatment option.\n\nThe 59-page filing describes the havoc that the opioid crisis has wreaked inside the county\u2019s emergency rooms, schools and child welfare system: Children are raised by relatives or put in foster care due to parents\u2019 addictions. Overdose patients are increasingly common in the county\u2019s emergency rooms. And at least six students overdosed at the start of the 2022-23 school year, according to the suit.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs \u2014 which act as the middleman between drug manufacturers and insurance companies \u2014 bear some of the blame for this rise in addiction. Behind the scenes, the companies effectively determine what drugs get covered by insurance companies and how much a patient will pay for it. Many also run their own mail service pharmacies.\n\nInstead of advocating for the lowest price, the county alleges, the companies used \u201cdeceptive, dangerous marketing\u201d to push dangerous drugs they knew would earn them a lucrative profit.\n\n\u201cDefendants are not bystanders in the opioid crisis,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThey helped fuel the fire.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA - JUNE 07: Fabian Bolanos, a Metro Ambassador, checks on a visitor at the Metro Westlake \/ MacArthur Park station.

In recent years, opioid manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers have been hit with thousands of lawsuits.\n\n\nCounties in Ohio, Texas and Virginia have all filed similar suits to L.A. County\u2019s, alleging that a small handful of pharmacy benefit managers turned a blind eye to obvious signs of addiction and drug abuse.\n\nThe county argues that Express Scripts and OptumRx were in a unique position to track the rise of the epidemic. The companies had data on opioid use for 166 million people covered by the insurance companies they contracted with, the county alleges, meaning they had real-time information how opioids were being abused among roughly half the U.S. population.\n\nThe county accused the companies of watching the opioid epidemic unfold and doing nothing.\n\n\u201cInstead of reporting illegitimate prescribing and sales uniquely visible to them in the extensive data they collect, the defendants ignored evidence of misuse, addiction, and diversion and used their data to boost their profits and manufacturers\u2019 sales at the expense of public health and safety,\u201d the lawsuit said.","labels":[]}
{"text":"RIYADH: At the end of July, a $2.6 billion deal with Brazil\u2019s biggest miner, Vale SA, gave Saudi Arabia a 10 percent interest in mines from Canada to Indonesia that produce copper, nickel and other industrial metals \u2014 all critical materials needed to help the world decarbonize. \n\nThe deal set the stage for a landmark shift in the metal and mining investment landscape and positions the Kingdom as a pivotal global player.\n\nDeals like the one with Vale SA are being staged at a time when governments across the world are questioning who controls the commodities needed to hit decarbonization targets and sustain the world\u2019s economy during intense climate change and volatile markets. \n\nAnother factor is China, which has long been the world\u2019s dominant mining country based on mineral production value, reporting over $217 billion in metallic mineral and coal production value, according to Statistica. Yet as geopolitical factors shift, the mining industry is also looking to other players.\n\n\u201cMining is going to be the third most important industry in the Kingdom,\u201d Saudi businessman Amr Khashoggi, who has been manufacturing gypsum for over 42 years, told Arab News.\n\n\u201cThere is a critical shortage of minerals that the world needs,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey go into phones, weaponry, electric cars and many different things.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia now wants to develop its mining industry and it is doing so through cooperation with various countries that are now working with the Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe development of the Kingdom\u2019s mining industry is one of the cornerstones of the Vision 2030 agenda towards economic growth, diversification and social transformation. \n\nSaudi Arabia is now seeking to take minority stakes in global mining assets that will over time allow it access to key supplies of strategic minerals.\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom has begun to explore the potential of its mineral wealth, currently estimated at $1.3 to $1.5 trillion in value,\u201d Ali Alireza, managing director of Haji Husein Alireza & Co. told Arab News. \u201cThis is an important key towards reducing the country\u2019s high dependence on oil and fossil fuels. \n\n\u201cThe Kingdom covers nearly 2 million sq. km and is one of the world\u2019s top 15 countries by area, with a relatively little developed mining industry. The potential is huge.\u201d\n\nTo kickstart this process, Alireza explains, Saudi Arabia passed a law in June 2020 to attract foreign investors into the Kingdom\u2019s mining business. The law, which came into effect in January 2021, aids the country in exploring mineral resources worth around $1.3 trillion, according to Invest Saudi.\n\nThis is all part of a campaign to attract nearly $200 billion in investments in mining by 2030.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources, the Kingdom possesses more than 20 different types of minerals, including gold, copper, iron, granite and marble. \n\nIn March this year, the ministry announced indicative timelines for the bidding cycles of five new mineral exploration opportunities that were showcased at the Future Minerals Forum 2023 in January in Riyadh. \n\nThis action underlines a strategic shift in the Kingdom\u2019s policy towards the discovery and extraction of minerals and metals that will aid the country\u2019s transition towards green energy.\n\n\u201cNew industries in a world trying to transition into a clean energy environment create new needs and opportunities in the mining sector,\u201d adds Alireza. \u201cIn this regard, Saudi mines are rich in such minerals as required, for instance, in battery transition in cars as well as other vital minerals for powering electricity generating turbines etc. Saudi Arabia\u2019s interest in the mining industry is not limited to within its shores, but complements it with international alliances such as that with Brasil\u2019s Vale SA and also the recent agreement with Japan to develop rare earth mining in Saudi Arabia and in other markets.\u201d\n\nThe development of the Kingdom\u2019s mining industry is contingent on foreign deals and investment. The Vale deal marks Saudi Arabia\u2019s first major foray into mining, and comes via Manara Minerals, a new venture between the Kingdom\u2019s Public Investment Fund and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, known as Ma\u2019aden.\n\nKhashoggi, who participated in the second Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh in January and was subsequently appointed to the National Mining Council of Saudi Arabia, pointed out the Kingdom is investing in mining companies that are using very advanced technologies. \u201cTechnology is becoming an important tool for the mining industry because you can use it for mapping, for operating machinery remotely without having people self-operate machinery. Such technologies can also be used efficiently in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Forum this year featured some of the biggest names in mining, including the CEO of the world\u2019s largest mining company, BHP\u2019s Mike Henry.\n\nAlso present was Dominic Barton, chairman of the Anglo-Australian multinational company Rio Tinto \u2013 the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation. \n\nThe attendance of such figures showed the Kingdom\u2019s growing place in the world\u2019s mining industry.\n\nHowever, as Khashoggi stressed: \u201cThe mining industry in Saudi Arabia is still in its infancy.\u201d\n\nTo move ahead, the Kingdom needs to keep investing in its own mining operations, secure more foreign investment, and make deals internationally.\n\nAlireza agrees, noting that while Saudi Arabia has been developing its own oil and gas industry through Saudi Aramco thanks to its own local knowledge, \u201cthe development of its mining industry is undertaken by inviting the investment and participation of world leaders in the mining sector to quickly build its own knowledge base and local Saudi expertise in this field.\u201d \n\nThe Kingdom, as it has realized, cannot grow alone, and its economic development and rise in this crucial world industry is contingent upon international collaboration.\n\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"Flight delays and cancellations that have plagued travelers in recent months have prompted a federal investigation into what's causing the chaos. And the issues are likely to linger for as much as a decade, a CBS News investigation found. \n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his office is now actively investigating several airlines for what a spokesperson described as \"unrealistic scheduling\" \u2014 practices that overstate a carrier's ability to service the tickets they sell, which can contribute to flight disruptions, including delays and cancellations.  \n\nThe aviation industry is short roughly 32,000 commercial pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers \u2014 and the gap widens every year, a CBS News analysis of data from the FAA, U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Department of Labor shows. \n\n\"There's definitely gaps in places,\" said Buttigieg. \"The system is just uneven right now.\" \n\nButtigieg acknowledged the staffing shortages are contributing to a surge in flight cancellations and delays that have affected millions of American travelers in recent months. \n\nWhen CBS News asked Buttigieg if his office should be holding airlines accountable and telling them not to schedule flights when there's not enough staff to fly them, the secretary was unequivocal.   \n\n\"If an airline is knowingly flying an unrealistic schedule, there are going to be consequences,\" Buttigieg said.  \n\n\"We have active investigations underway right now with regard to that,\" Buttigieg said. \"We take that very seriously because when you sell a ticket to a paying customer and you make a profit off of that, you better be ready to do everything in your power to service that ticket. And we're also going to hold you responsible for what happens if you can't.\" \n\n\"If you look at the delays, for example, that America experienced through last year in the summer 2022, a lot of that was driven by these companies not having the staff that they needed, Buttigieg said. \"This is not something that's going to be worked out overnight. It took years to get this way.\" \n\n\nCBS News analysis of the data provided by FlightAware shows that the number of delays caused by issues within air carriers' control has jumped from 5.2% in 2018 to 7.6% in 2023, a rise of thousands of delayed flights.  \n\n\"Unrealistic scheduling practices\" \nAirlines often blame the weather for delays. But staffing shortages can make those worse.  \n\nAnd it shows in the data.   \n\nThe pressure on the system became clear during a recent four-day period this summer: June 24-27, when 31,850 flights \u2014 a third of all flights nationwide \u2014 were delayed. During that time, airlines canceled 6,346 scheduled flights.  \n\nThat's one in every 17 flights canceled outright.  \n\nThe number of delays during those four days was 25% higher than in the same period last year. And when compared to the same period in 2019, before the pandemic, the number of cancellations was up 374%.    \n\nSecretary Buttigieg's office confirmed to CBS News that Southwest Airlines is among the carriers under investigation but declined to name other airlines involved in the department probe or give a timeline for that process. \n\n\nAt the time of publication, Southwest Airlines had not responded to a request from CBS News for comment.  \n\nIn late December, Southwest canceled thousands of flights during a massive winter storm. At the time, the airline issued a public apology for the disruptions, saying \"we've let our customers and employees down.\"  \n\nThe secretary's action comes in the wake of repeated calls for the Department of Transportation to provide a stronger response to increasing flight delays and cancellations as the country emerges from the pandemic. \n\n\nAccording to the DOT, from Dec. 24 to Dec. 31, 2022, software and staffing issues forced Southwest Airlines to cancel 14,042 flights, or 72.3% of all canceled flights nationwide, leaving passengers stranded around the country. \n\nAnd on Dec. 16, 2022, growing frustrated with rising complaints from consumers about ongoing flight disruptions, a bipartisan group of 34 state attorneys general wrote a letter to Secretary Buttigieg, saying \"the USDOT has yet to develop the ability to respond quickly enough to or coordinate effectively with our offices.\" \n\nAmong several recommendations, the attorneys general wrote that \"USDOT should require airlines to advertise and sell only flights that they have adequate personnel to fly and support, and perform regular audits of airlines to ensure compliance and impose fines on airlines that do not comply.\" \n\nMonths before that, in June 2022, U.S. Senators Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, and Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, both Democrats, wrote letters to the CEOs of 10 different airlines to demand corrective action.  \n\n\n\"While the industry has blamed these disruptions on unexpected weather and air traffic control issues, the data suggests the airlines themselves are at fault for many flight delays and cancellations,\" the senators wrote.   \n\n \"Airlines should have significant notice that they lack the crew to meet a certain flight schedule and, therefore, any shortages should not result in last-minute flight cancellations,\" the senators continued. \n\nKathleen Bangs, spokeswoman for flight tracking website FlightAware and a former commercial pilot, says when pending weather is a factor, it can be hard for airlines to predict how much to reduce flight schedules to spare passengers from travel headaches. \n\n\"How bad does it have to be?\" said Bangs. \"How widespread, how much of an impact do we think it's going to have at this airport, in that airport, to know how much we need to pare back those schedules? And I think, of course, they wanted to accommodate people.\" \n\n\nAirlines-4-America, the association which represents seven of the nation's biggest carriers, declined to talk with CBS News about flight disruptions and the impact of staffing shortages. In an email, a spokesperson said the airlines have \"reduced their schedules to reflect current operating realities,\" adding that they're \"hiring aggressively to make sure they have the right people in the right place at the right time.\" \n\n\"U.S. airlines recognize the importance of securing a pipeline of new employees\u2014pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and others\u2014and have established new pilot training programs, enhanced recruitment efforts and implemented programs to address financial hurdles,\" the spokesperson wrote. \n\n\"We can't catch up\"   \nThere's no doubt the staffing shortage \"affects us now,\" said Wichita State University emeritus associate professor Dean Headley. \"They are leaving planes on the ground because they don't have enough people to fly them for ground crews or anything like that.\" \n\nIn the past five years, flights reduced up to 48% in nation's busiest routes\nAirlines have cut a million flights, impacting some of the nation's busiest routes. One reason for the reduction in flights: airlines don't have enough staff to keep all those planes in the air.\n\nHeadley conducted marketing analyses on U.S. commercial airlines for decades at the W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State before retiring and assuming his current emeritus role there. Headley has published the Airline Quality Rating since 1991.  \n\n\n\"The airlines are doing about as much as they can [to improve staffing levels]. They can train about 1,500 to 1,800 pilots a year,\" Headley said.  \n\nBut since the industry is short about 17,000 pilots right now, \"we can't catch up that quick,\" he said. \n\nBecause of the current staffing shortage, commercial airlines have \"cut back flights to smaller regional airports. So, people [who] are not at a major airport will find that their flight schedules have been reduced simply because they don't have enough people to put in an airplane to fly it somewhere,\" Headley explained. \n\nAccording to a letter to the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee dated June 21, 2023, the Regional Airline Association (RAA) said airlines have already left 73 different markets since 2019 and 321 airports have lost some air service. According to the RAA, 61 airports have lost more than half their flights and 16 airports have lost all their major commercial flights. \n\nDean Headley says that smaller airports and cities can expect to see airlines cut back their routes there as they struggle to meet demand. \n\nWhat's worse, the data and industry experts, including Headley, say the trend in staffing issues points to a problem that could get a lot worse before it gets better and could affect your travel plans for another decade. \n\n\"Some of the predictions I'm hearing is that the pilot shortage won't be resolved until 2032 or something like that,\" Headley said.  \n\n\nThis worker shortage problem has been building for years but was made worse after the COVID pandemic forced airlines to drastically cut back on their routes and lay off thousands of workers. This prompted many pilots, flight attendants and maintenance workers to take early retirement or leave the industry altogether. When the flying public returned to the airports in 2022 and 2023, the airlines simply didn't have enough people to meet the new demand. \n\nTraining a pilot can take two years or longer and cost more than $100,000. And, by law, commercial pilots must retire at age 65.   \n\nAviation consultant Oliver Wyman predicts that because of that mandatory retirement the industry will be short 24,000 pilots by the year 2026 before the gap between trained pilots and the nation's commercial demand slowly begins to close. \n\nNot just pilots \nIt's the same story with aviation mechanics or maintenance technicians, as well as air traffic controllers. \n\nThe flying public's demand for flights is rising while the number of these critical workers is falling. \n\nWhile the number of people boarding planes has risen to record levels only seen just before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers working to move all those passengers and planes isn't keeping up with that demand.  \n\nThere aren't enough of these key air travel workers to meet demand\nBetween 2013 and 2022, the number of passengers increased by a greater percent than the number of pilots, while the number of air traffic controllers, mechanics and repairmen actually decreased.\n\n\"That is the big unsung shortage that nobody talks about,\" said Bangs of FlightAware. \"Most people don't understand that about half of all airline maintenance is done overseas. So, we outsource a lot of that maintenance and I think it's going to be challenging. We have to figure out a way \u2014 how do we attract young people to become mechanics, which are critical, but also at the same time they're outsourcing more and more of their work?\" \n\nProper training and certification can take 18 months to two years. Because of that time lag, consultant Oliver Wyman predicts a shortage of 18,000 mechanics in the coming years. \n\nThe worker shortfall includes perhaps the most important job to ensure the safety of the flying public, air traffic controllers. \n\nAir traffic controllers must attend a specialized academy for two to five months, then complete two to five years of on-the-job training before they can become fully certified. That process can cost a potential worker $35,000 or more. By law air traffic controllers must retire at age 56. \n\nRight now, CBS News analysis shows that there is a shortage of about 3,000 fully-certified air traffic controllers to meet current demand. \n\nWe are 3,000 air traffic controllers short of meeting demand.\nAir traffic controllers decreased by 11% while domestic airplane ridership has increased by 16% in the past decade.\n% change (air traffic controllers)\n2013-2022\n-65\n0\n+25\n\nPassenger counts represent the sum of originating and connecting passengers on all air carriers. An individual taking multiple flights is counted multiple times.\nMap: Dilcia Mercedes, CBS News  Source: Federal Aviation Administration\nA June 21, 2023, report by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Inspector General raises other serious concerns about that shortfall and takes the FAA to task for making \"limited efforts to ensure adequate controller staffing\" around the country.  The OIG found that in 20 of the 26 critical control towers in the United States, staffing fell well below the FAA's own 85% minimum threshold. And in New York TRACON (54%), Miami Tower (66%) and New York Center (68%) staffing is critically low. \n\nAll of this concerns 30-year veteran pilot Captain Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots' union. \n\n\"What I'm seeing is the system is under super pressure,\" Tajer said. Right now, \"we are sustaining that margin of safety ... but eventually it's like anything and something's going to give.\" \n\nOne possible solution to this shortage that's been embraced by government leaders and the airline industry: expanding the aviation workforce to include women and minorities once excluded from these jobs. U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that historically aviation jobs were made up of 95% White men. \n\n\"A lot of Americans have been underrepresented in aviation in the past,\" Secretary Buttigieg said. \"We've got to make sure that every kind of American who might be disposed to thrive in an aviation career sees that they could have a future, whether it's as a pilot, an air traffic controller, a mechanic.\" Multiple programs are trying to recruit a diverse workforce to fill the available jobs. \n\nOne is the Aviation Institute of Maintenance (AIM), which operates 15 campuses located across the United States.  Currently AIM is training about 4,200 students to become aviation maintenance technicians.  \n\nBoeing estimated the U.S. alone will need 178,000 aircraft mechanics, and more than 600,000 worldwide.\n\n\"The shortage is real, it's impacting everyone who engages in air travel, and it's an issue we have to address or ticket prices are going to continue to go up and the delays will continue to plague us,\" said AIM's vice president, Joel English. \n\n\"What we do in our classes is make sure that we're appealing to every type of individual who's looking for a great career pathway,\" said English. \"Looking around [at] our students, you'll see almost an even mix between Caucasian, African American and races like Hispanic and Asian. Our student body, about 15% female.\"  \n\nWhile 15% female students is still low, English says it is much higher than the current 2% of women mechanics in aviation today. \n\nIn 2022, 1,546 students graduated from AIM; 1,231 of them became certified aircraft technicians. English says the school has successfully placed more than 70% of its graduates in aviation industry jobs. \n\nNancy Tovar, a 33-year-old mother of two, has gone back to school to learn to become an airline mechanic near Dallas. \n\n\"I was a stay-at-home mom before I came into school,\" Tovar said. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do in life up until recently, and I just became a single mom. So that definitely motivated me and pushed me to figure out what's out here. And, you know, usually women\u2026 you don't see a lot of women in these kinds of professions.\" \n\n\"They only saw me as mom cleaning and cooking at home. And now they see me as mom is going to be working on this airplane that's flying and maybe the next one. And so, whenever they see a plane in the sky, they're going to be like, 'Mom, that's going to be you working on that one.'\" \n\nThere are also pilot schools that cater to only female pilots.  \n\nSome programs are working to attract future aviation workers while still in their early teens. A private specialty high school in the Dallas area is designed to teach students not only basic reading, writing and arithmetic but the skills of aerodynamics and flying. \n\nRising Aviation High School provides a traditional curriculum with an emphasis on STEM and aviation-related studies. The school even prepares students to get their private pilot's licenses. \n\nJocelyn Bruce, a junior, wants to attend the Air Force Academy and then fly for the Air Force before transitioning to piloting private charter or cargo planes. \n\n\"You would find that a lot of young girls, a lot of especially Black women really like aviation,\" Bruce said. \"They just never been told that it's something that they can do. So, a lot of them don't. They don't pursue. They don't pursue it.\" \n\nBruce admitted that embarking on her studies at the school put her out of her comfort zone. \n\n\"It made me a little nervous at first, but I got acclimated and comfortable,\" Bruce said. \"Now it's second nature.\" \n\nBoth Bruce and Tovar said the government could help by providing more scholarships and educational grants to aspiring professionals like them. \n\nThat's something Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg agreed is an idea worth considering. \n\n\"I don't believe that taxpayers should pay for something that companies should be doing on their own,\" said Buttigieg. \"But I do think it's a fair question why you would get more subsidy or support if you're going out to be a dentist then if you're going out to be a pilot (or aviation professional.) And we're looking right now what we might be able to do to true that up and to make sure that more people are supported who will have a great good paying career.\" \n\nButtigieg acknowledged that there currently are \"some gaps in what we do as a country when it comes to how we support the funding of the education for people to get into some of these fields.\" \n\n\"Student loans are something that are subsidized when you're going to a four-year university,\" Buttigieg said. \"But if you're going into one of these mechanics' programs, it's not quite the same. That's something I think we need to look at a policy level.\" \n","labels":[]}
{"text":"Global oil companies have rebounded since the pandemic to post their highest ever profits since people started using petroleum.\n\nChevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell all reported record profits in 2022 \u2014 a year in which Russia's war on Ukraine collided with the post-pandemic economic recovery to drive oil prices to their highest levels in history. \n\nTogether, the four companies saw $1 trillion in sales last year, a sum greater than the total economic output of Colombia, South Africa or Switzerland. TotalEnergies and BP are set to report their 2022 financial results next week. \n\nThe record profits come after a year of skyrocketing gas prices. After slumping hard in 2020, global consumption of oil and gasoline bounced back far slower than production, putting pressure on gas prices. Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago further shrank the world's oil supplies, bringing the average price of gas in the U.S. above $5 a gallon in the spring and summer.\n\n\nShell on Thursday reported a nearly $40 billion profit for last year. That's more than double the prior year's results and the most money Shell has ever made in its 115 years of existence. Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the U.S., posted record earnings of $36.5 billion last year, while refiner ConocoPhillips doubled its profits to $18.7 billion, the highest in the 10 years since it spun off its refining business.\n\n\nExxon, the largest U.S. oil producer, this week reported an epic $55 billion in profits for 2022. The oil giant's bottom line \"clearly benefited from a favorable market,\" CEO Darren Woods told investors. He also touted Exxon's investments before and during the pandemic, which allowed it to increase production as demand was ramping up. \n\n\"We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom,\" Woods said. \n\nThe windfall makes Exxon the third-most-profitable company of 2022, behind only Apple and Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn addition to high prices for crude oil, elevated natural-gas prices and high margins in the refining business also pushed up oil company profit, said Peter McNally, industrial and energy analyst at Third Bridge.\n\n\n\"Windfall\" profits\nThe White House and environmentalists have condemned oil companies' ballooning profits. The White House has criticized fossil-fuel companies for not increasing production to help bring down gas prices, and last year floated a tax on oil and gas profits. \n\nA White House spokesperson called Exxon's record profit \"outrageous\" in a statement to the BBC. The spokesperson, Abdullah Hasan, also blasted Chevron's announcement that it would spend $75 billion on buying back stock from investors.\n\n\"Companies clearly have everything they need \u2014 record profits and thousands of approved permits \u2014 to increase production. The only thing getting in the way is their own decision to keep plowing windfall profits into the pockets of executives,\" Hasan tweeted.\n\n\"A windfall tax on oil and gas profits is needed more than ever, to free up money that's desperately needed to help those struggling with the cost of energy, and as economies around the world face recession,\" Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner with Global Witness, told the Associated Press.\n\nSome jurisdictions, including the European Union and the U.K., have imposed such taxes on surplus energy-company profits, putting the proceeds toward covering citizens' skyrocketing energy costs. In December, Exxon sued to stop the EU's tax.\n\n\"We looked at what happened in the EU and said it both is not legal and it's the opposite of what is needed,\" Woods said Tuesday, calling the tax \"a penalty on the broad energy sector.\"\n\nDramatic turnaround\nOil companies have seen a remarkable turnaround from 2020, a year when travel ground to a halt, demand for fuel evaporated, dozens of oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy protection, and thousands of industry workers were laid off. Exxon lost $22 billion that year \u2014 the first year in decades that it had lost money.\n\n\nIn addition to oil-extracting operations that were taken offline in 2020, refining capacity also fell, contributing to higher gas prices and refinery profit margins.\n\n\"The refining business, particularly in the U.S., soared to record levels,\" McNally, the Third Bridge analyst, said. \"The price of crude oil went up but the prices of refined products like gasoline and diesel went up even more. The largest U.S. independent refiner, Marathon Petroleum, delivered record profits, but ExxonMobil and Chevron also compete in refining.\"","labels":[]}

This includes the Interstate 35, 40 and 44 corridors in Oklahoma City, Wichita Falls and some Tulsa suburbs. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued an ice storm warning for these areas.\n\nDepending on location and elevation, snowfall totals in the storm\u2019s impact zone will range anywhere from just 1 or 2 inches to as much as 12 inches. In some areas, wind gusts could reach 30 mph or higher, resulting in occasional blowing snow and whiteout conditions.\n\nCold Canadian air and plenty of moisture have spread over the impact zone. The NWS expects two waves of winter precipitation to develop. The first wave was already moving through the impact zone as of midday Monday and should gradually fade by Monday evening.\n\nBetween this wave and the next one, there\u2019s potential for freezing drizzle Monday night, particularly for places in the ice storm warning. This will make driving especially dangerous on bridges and overpasses.\n\n\n\nA second wave of snow and freezing rain is expected to develop across the impact zone late Monday night to Wednesday. This wave could be worse as the freezing temperatures may spread farther to the southeast, putting more places at risk for icing.\n\n\nSONAR ticker: ITVI.OKC\n\nThere may be loose capacity (a lot of truckers) in the Oklahoma City market right now. This is based on the latest FreightWaves data showing a large spike in Inbound Tender Volume index (ITVI.OKC) over the past 10 days. If they can\u2019t get out Monday to find loads in other markets, these drivers could get stuck for a couple of days. Fortunately, temperatures should warm up enough Thursday to melt the ice and snow in portions of the impact zone.\n","labels":[]}

For example, if companies can reuse older devices by equipping them with modern collaboration and security features \u2014 and spend less money doing so than they would replacing them \u2014 that\u2019s a sustainability win.\n\nGoogle helps companies achieve this goal with ChromeOS and ChromeOS Flex, a cloud-based version of the ChromeOS operating system that can be installed on Apple and Microsoft devices using a 16-gigabyte USB. \u201cYou simply plug it in, go into the BIOS, and boot to the USB,\u201d says DeVito. \u201cThis gives you two options: Wipe away the prior OS and replace it with ChromeOS, or just try ChromeOS on the USB.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, people assumed sustainability meant the environment. Now it encompasses all aspects of digital transformation.\u201d\nRobert DeVito Global Director of Chrome Customer and Partner Sales Engineering, Google\n\nWhat Does Digital Sustainability Success Look Like?\nIdeal business outcomes are no longer measured by profitability alone. Instead, Google sees success as a triple bottom line that can be measured with environmental, social and financial metrics.\n\nEnvironmental: \u201cFrom an environmental perspective, we\u2019re very lightweight,\u201d DeVito says of the Chrome line. \u201cChromeOS Flex is cloud-based and offers reduced power consumption.\u201d This allows companies to reduce e-waste by wiping the existing OS layer on old hardware and layering ChromeOS on top. Enterprises can also choose to make the move from legacy hardware to newer Chromebooks. Chromebooks can use 46 percent less energy than similar devices, according to Google.\nSocial: Because ChromeOS Flex is cloud-based, everything is synced in the cloud. According to DeVito, \u201cThis lets companies offer a device that allows people to work where and when they want while still ensuring integrity and confidentiality.\u201d ChromeOS also offers support for staff who have vision or hearing impairments, and Google has an ecosystem of applications and peripherals to help ensure employees are comfortable and productive.\nFinancial: \u201cThe overall cost of a Chromebook is less than comparable devices,\u201d notes DeVito. \u201cChromeOS doesn\u2019t require lots of RAM or quad-core processors.\u201d Using legacy devices with ChromeOS Flex, meanwhile, can help companies reduce total hardware costs.\nDISCOVER: How Chrome OS foils ransomware in hybrid work environments.\n\nEnhancing Security as You Grow Sustainably\nEnhanced security also limits costs. \u201cArchitecturally, we\u2019re a read-only OS,\u201d says DeVito. \u201cThis means attackers can\u2019t run .exe files, and IT teams can easily segment users from one another. We\u2019ve had no known ransomware attacks.\u201d Fewer security risks means reduced spending to mitigate these risks.\n\nWhile Chromebooks, ChromeOS and ChromeOS Flex set the stage for digital sustainability, success requires adoption at scale. \u201cThis is where partners come in,\u201d says DeVito. \u201cThey can help companies manage these services and streamline implementation.\u201d\n\nNEXT UP: Learn about the key benefits of Parallels for Chromebook Enterprise.\n\nChromeOS is ideal for most business use cases, DeVito says: \u201cChromeOS offers the best of all worlds. You can leverage older devices to reduce e-waste or buy newer devices for cheaper. You can offer devices that allow people to work where and when they want while ensuring you maintain integrity and confidentiality.\u201d","labels":[]}

{"text":"The social media company went public in 2013. But Elon Musk is taking it private as part of his acquisition of the firm. Here\u2019s what that means\n\nBy Kate Conger\nOct. 28, 2022\nElon Musk closes his purchase of Twitter and fires several top executives. Follow for the latest news updates.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In August 2018, Elon Musk called Michael Dell for advice.\n\nMr. Musk, who was trying to take Tesla, his electric car company, private, quizzed Mr. Dell, who had done that very thing with his eponymous computer company in 2013, about the process and the best lawyers to use for the complicated transaction.\n\n\u201cI was really asking him about \u2014 did he find being private was good?\u201d Mr. Musk recalled in a deposition about the Tesla effort. \u201cDid he regret going private?\u201d\n\nMr. Dell warned Mr. Musk that it was \u201ca very difficult process\u201d but that he was glad to have done it, according to court filings.\n\nNow, Mr. Musk, who did not end up taking Tesla private, is doing so with Twitter. As part of his $44 billion acquisition of the social media service, which closed on Thursday, he is delisting the company\u2019s stock and taking it out of the hands of public shareholders.\n\nMaking Twitter a private company gives Mr. Musk some advantages. Unlike publicly traded companies, privately held firms do not have to make quarterly public disclosures about their performance. They are also subject to less regulatory scrutiny and can be more tightly controlled by an owner. That means Mr. Musk can make over Twitter \u2014 including tweaking the platform\u2019s content rules, its finances and its priorities \u2014 without having to consider the worries of the investing public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to run a public company if you think you should be the one running it and you\u2019re not open to other views from people, like stockholders,\u201d said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. \u201cBy taking it private, you feel like you have a lot more flexibility.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Twitter is set to change as a private company under Mr. Musk.\n\nHow is Mr. Musk taking Twitter private?\nAs part of buying Twitter, Mr. Musk is merging the social media company with X Holdings, a corporate entity that he established in Delaware to handle the deal. X is buying out all of Twitter\u2019s stock and will control the service, and Mr. Musk will control the holding company.\n\nWhat happens to Twitter\u2019s stock?\nTwitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and its shares will no longer trade on public markets as of Nov. 8, according to a securities filing. In September, Twitter\u2019s shareholders approved the company\u2019s sale to Mr. Musk and agreed to sell their stock to him for $54.20 a share. Investors will be able to claim the cash value of their shares.\n\nWhat happens to Twitter\u2019s board of directors?\nWith the deal\u2019s completion, Twitter\u2019s board of directors will dissolve and its nine members will no longer preside over the company\u2019s operations. Mr. Musk will most likely appoint a new board made up of friends and investors who helped fund the acquisition. The new board will be responsible for plotting Twitter\u2019s trajectory as a private company.\n\n\u201cIt will still be required by law to have a board of directors, and that would probably include Elon Musk and some of the other big equity investors in the company,\u201d said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. \u201cI expect Mr. Musk will run it as a somewhat friendly dictatorship.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to Twitter\u2019s top executives?\nMr. Musk has already started cleaning house, with several of Twitter\u2019s top executives getting fired on Thursday.\n\nThe executives who were fired include Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, who has clashed publicly and privately with Mr. Musk. When Mr. Musk complained this year that Twitter had an unchecked spam problem, Mr. Agrawal tweeted to rebut his claims. Mr. Musk responded with a poop emoji.\n\nAt another point, Mr. Agrawal texted Mr. Musk, telling the billionaire that his criticisms were harming Twitter, according to a court filing.\n\n\u201cThis is a waste of time,\u201d Mr. Musk retorted.\n\nOther executives who were fired include Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel.\n\nUnder the merger agreement, Mr. Agrawal was potentially set to receive a golden parachute worth about $60 million, with Mr. Segal to receive $46 million, while Ms. Gadde would receive about $20 million. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Musk intended to make the payments.\n\nParag Agrawal was fired by Mr. Musk as Twitter\u2019s chief executive on Thursday. Credit...Kevin Dietsch\/Getty Images\n\nWhat about Twitter\u2019s employees?\nTwitter has about 7,500 employees. Some of them have been jittery for months about the company\u2019s sale to Mr. Musk. Many could face layoffs or job changes as their new owner takes over.\n\nTheir compensation is also set to change. Employees typically receive stock options in the company. But, with the delisting of Twitter\u2019s stock, employees are set to be cashed out for shares they already have and to be paid with cash bonuses going forward, instead of the stock options they were scheduled to receive, according to the merger agreement. Some employees have worried that Mr. Musk may not honor the agreement.\n\n\u201cMost of these employees have been in a public company and are used to public option grants, which are liquid,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cThey will have to come up with some other Silicon Valley-friendly method of keeping people around.\u201d\n\nWhat financial pressures will Twitter face as a private company?\nBy going private, Twitter will avoid some public scrutiny since it will no longer be required to make quarterly disclosures about the health of its business. This will give Mr. Musk some flexibility as he changes Twitter.\n\nBut he will face pressure from the banks that lent him $12.5 billion for the deal to begin repaying his debt. The cost of repaying those loans could run as high as $1 billion a year, financial analysts said.\n\n\u201cHe has less public pressure, but he has a lot of private pressure from the banks to make the payments,\u201d Mr. Quinn said of Mr. Musk. \u201cLike almost every other private-equity take-private, he\u2019s going to need a manager who is very focused on operations, being lean and being able to pay the bills on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\nMr. Musk also took about $7.1 billion from equity investors to push the deal through. He may also face pressure from those investors, who might expect him to take Twitter public again at some point so that they can recoup their investment.\n\nIn some take-private deals, owners have opted to sell branches of their companies to pay their debts. Mr. Musk could choose to do the same at Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that some aspects of Twitter could potentially be carved off, sold off or spun off to raise money that could go toward paying the debt,\u201d Mr. Talley said. \u201cTwitter kind of is pared down to its core mission right now. They would have to get a little creative.\u201d\n","labels":[]}

{"text":"The U.S. economic recovery has repeatedly defied predictions of an impending recession, withstanding supply-chain backlogs, labor shortages, global conflicts and the fastest increase in interest rates in decades.\n\nThat resilience now faces a new test: a banking crisis that, at times over the past week, seemed poised to turn into a full-blown financial meltdown as oil prices plunged and investors poured money into U.S. government debt and other assets perceived as safe.\n\nMarkets remained volatile on Friday \u2014 stocks had their worst day of the week \u2014 as leaders in Washington and on Wall Street sought to keep the crisis contained.\n\nEven if those efforts succeed \u2014 and veterans of previous crises cautioned that was a big \u201cif\u201d \u2014 economists said the episode would inevitably take a toll on hiring and investments as banks pulled back on lending, and businesses struggled to borrow money as a result. Some forecasters said the turmoil had already made a recession more likely.\n\n\u201cThere will be real and lasting economic repercussions from this, even if all the dust settles well,\u201d said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cI would raise the probability of a recession given what\u2019s happened in the last week.\u201d\n\nAt a minimum, the crisis has complicated the already delicate task facing officials at the Federal Reserve, who have been trying to slow the economy gradually in order to bring inflation to heel. That task is as urgent as ever: Government data on Tuesday showed that prices continued to rise at a rapid clip in February. But now policymakers must grapple with the risk that the Fed\u2019s efforts to fight inflation could be destabilizing the financial system.\n\nThey don\u2019t have long to weigh their options: Fed officials will hold their next regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday amid unusual uncertainty about what they will do. As recently as 10 days ago, investors expected the central bank to reaccelerate its campaign of interest rate increases in response to stronger-than-expected economic data. Now, Fed watchers are debating whether the meeting will end with rates unchanged.\n\n\nA man leaving an office building as another person enters through a door with the letters SVB.\nThe failure of Silicon Valley Bank, the midsize California institution, set the latest turmoil in motion.Credit...Ian C. Bates for The New York Times\n\nThe notion that the rapid increase in interest rates could threaten financial stability is hardly new. In recent months, economists have remarked often that it is surprising that the Fed has been able to raise rates so much, so fast without severe disruptions to a marketplace that has grown used to rock-bottom borrowing costs.\n\nWhat was less expected is where the first crack showed: small and midsize U.S. banks, in theory among the most closely monitored and tightly regulated pieces of the global financial system.\n\nInflation F.A.Q.\nWhat is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.\n\nWhat causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.\n\nIs inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.\n\nHow does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.\n\nCan inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\u201cI was surprised where the problem came, but I wasn\u2019t surprised there was a problem,\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and leading scholar of financial crises, said in an interview. In an essay in early January, he warned of the risk of a \u201clooming financial contagion\u201d as governments and businesses struggled to adjust to an era of higher interest rates.\n\nHe said he did not expect a repeat of 2008, when the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market quickly engulfed virtually the entire global financial system. Banks around the world are better capitalized and better regulated than they were back then, and the economy itself is stronger.\n\n\u201cUsually to have a more systemic financial crisis, you need more than one shoe to drop,\u201d Professor Rogoff said. \u201cThink of higher real interest rates as one shoe, but you need another.\u201d\n\nStill, he and other experts said it was alarming that such severe problems could go undetected so long at Silicon Valley Bank, the midsize California institution whose failure set in motion the latest turmoil. That raises questions about what other threats could be lurking, perhaps in less regulated corners of finance such as real estate or private equity.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not on top of that, then what about some of these other, more shadowy parts of the financial system?\u201d said Anil Kashyap, a University of Chicago economist who studies financial crises.\n\nAlready, there are hints that the crisis may not be limited to the United States. Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank after investors dumped its stock as fears arose about its financial health. The 166-year-old lender has faced a long series of scandals and missteps, and its problems aren\u2019t directly related to those of Silicon Valley Bank and other U.S. institutions. But economists said the violent market reaction was a sign that investors were growing concerned about the stability of the broader system.\n\nThe turmoil in the financial world comes just as the economic recovery, at least in the United States, seemed to be gaining momentum. Consumer spending, which fell in late 2022, rebounded early this year. The housing market, which slumped in 2022 as mortgage rates rose, had shown signs of stabilizing. And despite high-profile layoffs at large tech companies, job growth has stayed strong or even accelerated in recent months. By early March, forecasters were raising their estimates of economic growth and marking down the risks of a recession, at least this year.\n\n\u200cNow, many of them are reversing course. Mr. Bryson, of Wells Fargo, said he now put the probability of a recession this year at about 65 percent, up from about 55 percent before the recent bank failures. Even Goldman Sachs, among the most optimistic forecasters on Wall Street in recent months, said Thursday that the chances of a recession had risen \u200c10 percentage points, to 35 percent, as a result of the crisis and the resulting uncertainty.\n\nThe most immediate impact is likely to be on lending. Small and midsize banks could tighten their lending standards and issue fewer loans, either in a voluntary effort to shore up their finances or in response to heightened scrutiny from regulators. That could be a blow to residential and commercial developers, manufacturers and other businesses that rely on debt to finance their day-to-day operations.\n\nJanet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday that the federal government was \u201cmonitoring very carefully\u201d the health of the banking system and of credit conditions more broadly.\n\n\u201cA more general problem that concerns us is the possibility that if banks are under stress, they might be reluctant to lend,\u201d she told members of the Senate Finance Committee. That, she added, \u201ccould turn this into a source of significant downside economic risk.\u201d\n\nTighter credit is likely to be a particular challenge for small businesses, which typically don\u2019t have ready access to other sources of financing, such as the corporate debt market, and which often rely on relationships with bankers who know their specific industry or local community. Some may be able to get loans from big banks, which have so far seemed largely immune from the problems facing smaller institutions. But they will almost certainly pay more to do so, and many businesses may not be able to obtain credit at all, forcing them to cut back on hiring, investing and spending.\n\nImage\nA three-story multifamily building under construction, with excavation equipment in front.\nThe housing market, which slumped in 2022 as mortgage rates rose, had shown signs of stabilizing before the banking crisis arose.Credit...Jennifer Pottheiser for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIt may be hard to replace those small and medium-size banks with other sources of capital,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan. \u201cThat, in turn, could hinder growth.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSlower growth, of course, is exactly what the Fed has been trying to achieve by raising interest rates \u2014 and tighter credit is one of the main channels through which monetary policy is believed to work. If businesses and consumers pull back activity, either because borrowing becomes more expensive or because they are nervous about the economy, that could, in theory, help the Fed bring inflation under control.\n\nBut Philipp Schnabl, a New York University economist who has studied the recent banking problems, said policymakers had been trying to rein in the economy by crimping demand for goods and services. A financial upheaval, by contrast, could result in a sudden loss of access to credit. That tighter bank lending could also affect overall supply in the economy, which is hard to address through Fed policy.\n\n\u201cWe have been raising rates to affect aggregate demand,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you get this credit crunch, but that\u2019s coming from financial stability concerns.\u201d\n\nStill, the U.S. economy retains sources of strength that could help cushion the latest blows. Households, in the aggregate, have ample savings and rising incomes. Businesses, after years of strong profits, have relatively little debt. And despite the struggles of their smaller peers, the biggest U.S. banks are on much firmer financial footing than they were in 2008.\n\n\u201cI still believe \u2014 not just hope \u2014 that the damage to the real economy from this is going to be pretty limited,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI can tell a very com","labels":[]}

In the long run, the common currency will contribute to the economy's resilience and a higher standard of living.\n\nCroatia has worked hard to achieve the economic convergence required for the introduction of the euro. The country has implemented far reaching economic and governance reforms, curbed inflation, and pursued sound public spending policies. Croatia's banking sector has also taken steps to allow the country to join the banking union.\n\nDespite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and devastating earthquakes, Croatia\u2019s efforts and determination have paid off. In the summer of 2022, the EU institutions and finance ministers concluded that Croatia's economy was ready to introduce the euro.\n\nAs a member of the euro area, Croatia will also join the European Stability Mechanism, and from now on will take a seat in the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. We look forward to working together at the monthly meetings of the Eurogroup, which brings together finance ministers from the euro area to discuss matters relating to our common currency.\n\nCroatia is joining the euro area at a difficult time. Although current geopolitical developments, high energy prices and inflation are affecting our economies differently, we all face a high degree of uncertainty and similar challenges. Our economies are forecast to slowdown in the coming months.\n\nYet we should be optimistic. Economic growth in the euro area in the first half of last year [2022] was higher than expected, and labour markets have shown remarkable resilience. We also have the \u20ac750 billion recovery plan that helps governments finance growth-enhancing reforms and investments. In addition, through close coordination of our economic and fiscal policies, we can help overcome the difficulties we face today.\n\nEconomic policy coordination will be one of the most important discussions in the coming months in the Eurogroup, but there are other projects and tasks ahead for the euro area finance ministers this year. To name just a few, we will be looking into strengthening the foundations of the economic and monetary union, through the review of our common budgetary rules and further work on the banking union. And work on an ECB-backed digital euro is underway to ensure our currency is responsive to future needs.\n\nWe must also look to the future and avail of the opportunities that the new geopolitical realities are creating. As the war is drastically accelerating our energy transition, we need to combine our efforts and resources to ensure that the EU becomes the global leader in renewable energy, and the euro, the currency of a low carbon future.\n\nThe euro is proof of what we can achieve when we work together. By sharing a common currency, we inevitably share our goals and align our policies. The advantages of European integration go beyond economic benefits: our strength lies in our unity of purpose, our commitment to a shared European destiny, our inseparable ties. The famous inventor, Nikola Tesla, whose image adorns some of the Croatia-minted euro coins, provides a particularly fitting while poetic description of the links that tie European people together: \u201cThough free to think and act, we are held together, like the stars in the firmament, with ties inseparable. These ties cannot be seen, but we can feel them.\u201d\n\nNo matter the challenges that lie ahead, Europe will find common solutions. And Croatia, more than ever, will be part of them.\n","labels":[]}
