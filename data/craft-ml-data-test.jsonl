{"text":"German supermarket chain Aldi said it was buying Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harvey's, which together operate 400 stores in the southern U.S.\nThe merger would make Aldi one of the country's largest supermarket chains.\nFederal officials and regulators have grown increasingly skeptical of supermarket mergers, fearing decreasing competition could further drive up food prices that soared during the pandemic.\nGerman supermarket giant Aldi said it plans to buy two southern U.S. chains, even as grocery mergers have come under scrutiny from government officials over potential costs to consumers.\nAldi said Wednesday that it was purchasing the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harvey\u2019s chains, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, acquiring a total of 400 stores. Together with planned store construction, the merger would bring the total number of Aldi stores in the U.S. to 2,400, the company said, making it one of the largest chains in the country.\n1\n\nThe announcement comes as the Federal Trade Commission is deciding whether to approve a merger of Kroger and Albertsons which together have 4,996 stores. On Wednesday, seven secretaries of state published a letter urging the FTC to block that deal over worries that it could reduce competition in the grocery business and give big players more power to raise prices.\n2\n \n\u201cOnce there is such consolidation in the market, many consumers will no longer have choice. Kroger-Albertsons will have no competitive incentive to bring down prices,\u201d the letter said. \u201cConsumers will be powerless to hold the company accountable to promises of keeping prices low.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also recently voiced concerns over competition in the grocery store business.\n\n\u201cJust four supermarket companies control over a third of the market nationwide. And it\u2019s even more concentrated at the local level, where consumers have had even fewer stores to choose from,\u201d Biden said in a speech at the White House last month. \u201cGroceries in consolidated markets will charge you more because you have nowhere else to shop.\u201d\n3\n\n\nThe FTC proposed new guidelines last month detailing how they will evaluate grocery store mergers, with an eye toward protecting consumers from price gouging, the same day the Department of Agriculture said it was launching a partnership with attorneys general from 31 states and Washington, D.C. to combat anti-competitive behavior by food companies.\n4\n5\n\nShoppers have felt the sting of soaring food prices since the pandemic hit. As of July, groceries were 23.7% more expensive than in February 2020, according to the Consumer Price Index.\n6\n While grocery inflation has subsided lately, prices haven\u2019t gone down much, squeezing household budgets and causing some to go hungry. The percentage of families reporting food insecurity, or not having access to adequate food, rose to 24.6% from 20% between December 2021 and December 2022, a survey by the Urban Institute found.\n7\n ","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"On 1 January, Croatia began a new chapter in its history \u2013 by becoming the 20th EU country to introduce the euro.\n\nIt is a momentous day for the people of Croatia as it is for all of us in Europe.\n\nBy becoming its twentieth member in a little more than 20 years of the euro\u2019s existence, Croatia\u2019s accession is a timely reminder of the core values that unite us, the common cause that guides us and the shared objectives that make us a broader and stronger union. Amid ever-greater uncertainty, an unstable geopolitical environment and challenging economic prospects clouded by the unjustified and cruel war raging at our borders, Croatia's achievement offers us respite and, above all, hope.\n\nCroatia joins the euro area as well as the Schengen area just a decade after becoming a member of the European Union and barely three decades after becoming an independent country. Croatia has come a long way at record speed. It is now among the fastest growing economies in Europe \u2013 well above the EU average \u2013 and among those with stronger growth forecasts for this year.\n\nEuro membership will bring many tangible benefits for Croatian citizens and businesses alike. The euro makes it easier and safer for citizens to travel, work or study across the euro area. It is particularly good news for Croatia's booming tourism sector, which accounts for around a fifth of the country's GDP. Being part of the euro area will make investment in Croatia easier and more attractive, as it will eliminate currency exchange costs and associated risks and thus lower barriers for businesses. It will also ensure lower interest rates and overall greater financial stability. In the long run, the common currency will contribute to the economy's resilience and a higher standard of living.\n\nCroatia has worked hard to achieve the economic convergence required for the introduction of the euro. The country has implemented far reaching economic and governance reforms, curbed inflation, and pursued sound public spending policies. Croatia's banking sector has also taken steps to allow the country to join the banking union.\n\nDespite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and devastating earthquakes, Croatia\u2019s efforts and determination have paid off. In the summer of 2022, the EU institutions and finance ministers concluded that Croatia's economy was ready to introduce the euro.\n\nAs a member of the euro area, Croatia will also join the European Stability Mechanism, and from now on will take a seat in the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. We look forward to working together at the monthly meetings of the Eurogroup, which brings together finance ministers from the euro area to discuss matters relating to our common currency.\n\nCroatia is joining the euro area at a difficult time. Although current geopolitical developments, high energy prices and inflation are affecting our economies differently, we all face a high degree of uncertainty and similar challenges. Our economies are forecast to slowdown in the coming months.\n\nYet we should be optimistic. Economic growth in the euro area in the first half of last year [2022] was higher than expected, and labour markets have shown remarkable resilience. We also have the \u20ac750 billion recovery plan that helps governments finance growth-enhancing reforms and investments. In addition, through close coordination of our economic and fiscal policies, we can help overcome the difficulties we face today.\n\nEconomic policy coordination will be one of the most important discussions in the coming months in the Eurogroup, but there are other projects and tasks ahead for the euro area finance ministers this year. To name just a few, we will be looking into strengthening the foundations of the economic and monetary union, through the review of our common budgetary rules and further work on the banking union. And work on an ECB-backed digital euro is underway to ensure our currency is responsive to future needs.\n\nWe must also look to the future and avail of the opportunities that the new geopolitical realities are creating. As the war is drastically accelerating our energy transition, we need to combine our efforts and resources to ensure that the EU becomes the global leader in renewable energy, and the euro, the currency of a low carbon future.\n\nThe euro is proof of what we can achieve when we work together. By sharing a common currency, we inevitably share our goals and align our policies. The advantages of European integration go beyond economic benefits: our strength lies in our unity of purpose, our commitment to a shared European destiny, our inseparable ties. The famous inventor, Nikola Tesla, whose image adorns some of the Croatia-minted euro coins, provides a particularly fitting while poetic description of the links that tie European people together: \u201cThough free to think and act, we are held together, like the stars in the firmament, with ties inseparable. These ties cannot be seen, but we can feel them.\u201d\n\nNo matter the challenges that lie ahead, Europe will find common solutions. And Croatia, more than ever, will be part of them.\n","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"Pharmaceutical giants have accumulated sizable war chests to buy up rivals. Scope Group, a financial ratings firm, reports that the world\u2019s 10 largest pharmas collectively have $120 billion (\u20ac111 billion) in cash on their balance sheets. \u201cThe pharmaceutical sector will remain one of the few industry sectors where M&A [mergers and acquisitions] remains buoyant despite rising interest rates, but large mergers and cross-border transactions are not likely,\u201d stated a report by Olaf T\u00f6lke, Scope\u2019s director of corporate ratings.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies are flush with cash. The sustained pandemic impact on demand for vaccines, treatments and Covid-related diagnostics, and more indirectly, government recognition of the importance of public health investment, have combined to increase cash inflows, providing them with the means to undertake ambitious acquisitions,\u201d said the Scope report. These large companies include well-known names like Pfizer, MSD (Merck Sharp & Dohme), Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Roche.\n\n\nScope believes medium-sized mergers and acquisitions will emerge in the months ahead, targeting specific therapeutic areas of specialization, such as cardiology, oncology, neurology, and diabetes. Amgen\u2019s acquisition of Horizon for around $40 billion is currently in the works. \u201cWe would not be surprised to see transactions of up to $20 billion.\u201d\n\nCompanies like these require continuous innovation to replace expiring drug patents and deliver products that serve the medical community and patients alike. When patent exclusivity is lost, drugs face stiff competition from generics and biosimilars, leading to lower sales and prices that ultimately affect the bottom line.\n\nPatent expiration\nThe expiration of drug patents poses a significant risk to major companies, as highlighted in the Scope report (citing Bloomberg data). Specifically, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) stands to lose 79% of its projected 2025 revenue between 2025 and 2029 due to loss of patent exclusivity. To fill the revenue gap, BMS must focus on developing and launching its own drugs or acquiring new therapies and companies in the years ahead. Among the companies most heavily affected by revenue loss from patent expiration are GSK (56%), Amgen (55%), MSD (49%), Lilly (46%), Johnson & Johnson (46%), and Roche (38%).\n\nPfizer, the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company, faces a 37% revenue loss from patent expiration. The company finds itself in a challenging predicament \u2014 the reduced global demand for its Covid-19 vaccine has led to a decline in revenue. To remedy this, Pfizer has signaled its willingness to explore acquisitions. Under the leadership of CEO Albert Bourla, Pfizer is projecting revenue of $67-$71 billion for 2023, a noticeable decline from its record-breaking $100 billion peak in 2022.\n\nIn the Scope report, T\u00f6lke says large pharmaceutical conglomerates are a thing of the past. Rather, highly capitalized companies are increasingly focused on efficiency, and are spinning off multi-million dollar ancillary businesses. Johnson & Johnson is a prime example of this trend, as it prepares to shed its huge consumer products division in the coming months.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition","labels":["investments"]}

Some 3,400 workers are involved in firefighting in British Columbia, western Canada.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is grim,\u201d the premier, David Eby, told reporters on Saturday.\n\nCanada is experiencing its worst wildfire season, with official estimates of more than 14m hectares (34.6m acres) already burned \u2013 roughly the size of Greece and almost twice the area of the last record of 7.3m hectares.

Shane Thompson, the province\u2019s environment minister, said on Saturday evening it was not safe to return to Yellowknife yet because the fires were burning deep in the forest and were still active and huge.\n\nSince the evacuation was ordered on Wednesday, more than 19,000 people have fled by road or air, with about 1,000 essential staff remaining in the area. Firefighting crews were remaining to erect defenses from the flames, while water bombers have been seen flying low over the city, with the Canadian military also helping out.\n\nTony Whitford, a former commissioner for the Northwest Territories and a longtime resident of Yellowknife, arrived in the city of Calgary on one of the first flights out and gave the evacuation high marks. \u201cMy compliments to them all,\u201d Whitford, who is 82 and wheelchair-bound, said of the organizers. \u201cIt\u2019s so complex \u2013 20,000 people \u2013 it\u2019s incredible.

{"text":"On September 29, 2021, the United States and the European Union\u2019s (EU) new Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held their first summit. It took place in the old industrial city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under the leadership of the European Commission\u2019s Vice-President, Margrethe Vestager, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Following the meeting, the U.S. and the EU declared their opposition to artificial intelligence (AI) that does not respect human rights and referenced rights-infringing systems, such as social scoring systems.1 During the meeting, the TTC clarified that \u201cThe United States and European Union have significant concerns that authoritarian governments are piloting social scoring systems with an aim to implement social control at scale. These systems pose threats to fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, including through silencing speech, punishing peaceful assembly and other expressive activities, and reinforcing arbitrary or unlawful surveillance systems.\u201d2\n\nThe implicit target of the criticism was China\u2019s \u201csocial credit\u201d system, a big data system that uses a wide variety of data inputs to assess a person\u2019s social credit score, which determines social permissions in society, such as buying an air or train ticket.3 The critique by the TTC indicates that the U.S. and the EU disagree with China\u2019s view of how authorities should manage the use of AI and data in society.4 The TTC can therefore be viewed as the beginning steps towards forming an alliance around a human rights-oriented approach to the development of artificial intelligence in democratic countries, which contrasts with authoritarian countries such as Russia and China. However, these different approaches may lead to technological decoupling, conceptualized as national strategic decoupling of otherwise interconnected technologies such as 5G, hardware such as computer chips, and software such as operating systems. Historically, the advent of the world wide web created an opportunity for the world to be interconnected as one global digital ecosystem. Growing mistrust between nations, however, has caused a rise in digital sovereignty, which refers to a nation\u2019s ability to control its digital destiny and may include control over the entire AI supply chain, from data to hardware and software. A consequence of the trend toward greater digital sovereignty\u2014which then drives the trend further\u2014is increasing fear of being cut off from critical digital components such as computer chips and a lack of control over the international flow of citizens\u2019 data. These developments threaten existing forms of interconnectivity, causing markets for high technology to fragment and, to varying degrees, retrench back into the nation state.\n\nTo understand the extent to which we are moving towards varying forms of technological decoupling, this article first describes the unique positions of the European Union, United States and China concerning regulation of data and the governance of artificial intelligence. The article then discusses implications of these different approaches for technological decoupling, and then discusses implications for specific policies around AI, such as the U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act, the EU\u2019s AI Act, and China\u2019s regulation of recommender engines.\n\nEurope: A holistic AI governance regime\nThe EU has, in many ways, been a frontrunner in data regulation and AI governance. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018, set a precedent for regulating data. This is seen in how the legislation has inspired other acts, e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL). The EU\u2019s AI Act (AIA), which could go into effect by 2024, also constitutes a new and groundbreaking risk-based regulation of artificial intelligence, which, together with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA), creates a holistic approach to how authorities seek to govern the use of AI and information technology in society.\n\nThe EU AI Act establishes a horizontal set of rules for developing and using AI-driven products, services, and systems within the EU. The Act is modelled on a risk-based approach that moves from unacceptable risks (e.g., social credit scoring and use of facial recognition technologies for real-time monitoring of public spaces), to high risk (e.g., AI systems used in hiring and credit applications), to limited risk (e.g., a chatbot) to little or no risk (e.g., AI-enabled video games or spam filters). While AI systems that pose unacceptable risks are outrightly banned, high-risk systems will be subject to conformity assessments, including independent audits and new forms of oversight and control. Limited risk systems are subject to transparency obligations, such as user-facing information when interacting with a chatbot. In contrast, little or no risk systems remain unaffected by the AI Act.5\n\nThe EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) attempts, among other things, to ensure that digital platforms that possess so-called gatekeeper functions, in their access to and control of large swaths of consumer data, do not exploit their data monopolies to create unequal market conditions. The implicit goal is to increase (European) innovation, growth, and competitiveness.\n\nSimilarly, the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) seeks to give consumers more control over what they see online. This means, for example, better information about why specific content is recommended through recommender engines and the possibility of opting out of recommender-based profiling. The new rules aim to protect users from illegal content and aim to tackle harmful content, such as political or health-related misinformation. In effect, this carves out new responsibilities for very large platforms and search engines to engage in some forms of content moderation. This means that gatekeeper platforms are considered responsible for mitigating against risks such as disinformation or election manipulation, balanced against restrictions on freedom of expression, and subject to independent audits.\n\nThe aim of these new laws is not only to ensure that the rights of EU citizens are upheld in the digital space but also to make sure that European companies have a better opportunity to compete against large U.S. tech firms. One way of doing this is to mandate compatibility requirements between digital products and services. Such compatibility requirements have already required Apple to change the standard of its charger starting in 20246 and could also require greater interoperability between messaging services such as Apple\u2019s iMessage, Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Chat, and Microsoft Teams.7 While increased interoperability could increase the vulnerability and complexity of security-related issues, instituting such changes would arguably make it harder for companies to secure market share and continue their network-driven forms of dominance.\n\nAt the same time, the EU is trying to build ties to U.S. tech companies by opening an office in the heart of Silicon Valley headed by Gerard de Graaf, the European Commission\u2019s director of digital economy, who is expected to establish closer contact with companies such as Apple, Google, and Meta.8 The strategic move by the EU is also going to serve as a mechanism to ensure that American tech companies comply with new European rules such as the AIA, DMA, and DSA.\n\nConcerning semiconductors, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the European Chips Act in February 2022, intending to make the EU a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.9 By 2030, the European share of global semiconductor production is expected to more than double, increasing from 9 to 20%. The European Chips Act is a response to the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and China\u2019s ambitions to achieve digital sovereignty through the development of semiconductors. Semiconductors are the cornerstone of all computers and, thus, are integral for developing artificial intelligence. Strategic policies such as the European Chips Act suggest that control over the computer-based part of the AI value chain and the politicization of high-tech development will only become more important in coming years.\n\nThe largest tech companies\u2014Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others\u2014are mostly found in the U.S. and China, not in Europe. To address this imbalance, the EU aims to set the regulatory agenda for public governance of the digital space. The new regulations aim to ensure that international companies comply with European rules while strengthening the EU\u2019s resolve to obtain digital sovereignty.\n\nUS: A light-touch approach to AI governance\nThe United States\u2019 approach to artificial intelligence is characterized by the idea that companies, in general, must remain in control of industrial development and governance-related criteria.10 So far, the U.S. federal government has opted for a hands-off approach to governing AI in order to create an environment free of burdensome regulation. The government has repeatedly stated that \u201cburdensome\u201d rules and state regulations often are considered \u201cbarriers to innovation,\u201d1112 which must be reduced, for example, in areas such as autonomous vehicles.\n\n\nThe U.S. also takes a different approach than the EU and China in the area of data regulation. The U.S. has not yet drawn up any national policy on data protection, such as in the EU, where in 2018 the GDPR introduced a harmonized set of rules across the EU. By comparison, only five out of 50 U.S. states\u2014California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia\u2014have adopted comprehensive data legislation.13 As a result, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective in 2020, has, to some extent, become the U.S.\u2019s de facto data regulation.14 The GDPR in many ways served as a model for CCPA, which requires companies to give consumers increased privacy rights, including the right to access and delete any personal data as well as the right to opt-out of having data sold and be free from online discrimination.\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects platforms from liability for content posted. Under current law, liability for content remains with users who post it.15 In part due to this focus on users rather than platforms, in the U.S. there is little oversight of recommender engines that rank, organize, and determine the visibility of information across search engines and social media platforms. Content moderation is a thorny issue, however. On the one hand, there is an argument to be made for platforms to engage in content moderation to avoid overly discriminatory and harmful behavior online. On the other hand, states such as Texas, and Florida, among others, are passing laws prohibiting tech companies from \u201ccensoring\u201d users, which are enacted to protect their constituents\u2019 rights to free speech.16 The counterargument made by platforms is that their content moderation decisions, as well as their use of recommender engines, is a form of expression that should be protected by the First Amendment, which defends American citizens and companies from government restraints on speech.17\n\nWhile the United States takes a laissez-faire approach to regulating artificial intelligence, that tends to be fragmented at the state level, new industrial policy initiatives are aimed explicitly at strengthening certain aspects of the AI supply chain. One example is the CHIPS and Science Act, where Democrats and Republicans have come together to create new incentives for producing semiconductors on American soil.18 Based on the idea of digital sovereignty, the CHIPS and Science Act marks a shift in U.S. industrial policy to address renewed concerns over maintaining U.S. technological leadership in the face of fast-growing competition from China.\n\nWhen it comes to using artificial intelligence in the public sector, the United States has experienced significant opposition from civil society, especially to law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition technologies (FRT), for example, from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).19 Again, the U.S. approach has been fragmented. Several cities\u2014such as Boston, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, and Portland\u2014have banned government agencies, including the police, from using FRT. \u201cIt does not work. African Americans are 5-10 times more likely to be misidentified,\u201d said Alameda Council member John Knox White, who helped ban facial recognition in Oakland in 2019.20\n\nIn the United States, a March 2021 report by the country\u2019s National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) defined the \u201cAI race\u201d (between China and the United States) as a value-based competition in which China must be seen as a direct competitor.21 In the report, NSCAI went further and recommended creating so-called \u201cchoke points\u201d that limit Chinese access to American semiconductors to stall progress in some areas of technological development.22 Some of these \u201cchoke points\u201d were seen in August 2022, when the U.S. Department of Commerce banned Nvidia from selling its A100, A100X, and H100 computer graphics processing units (GPUs) to customers in China, in a move intended to slow China\u2019s progress in semiconductor development and prevent advanced chips from being used for military applications in China. The Department of Commerce justified the move by saying it was meant to \u201ckeep advanced technologies out of the wrong hands,\u201d while Nvidia has signaled that it will have serious consequences for its global sales of semiconductors.23\n\nOver the years, however, many Chinese researchers have contributed to important breakthroughs in AI-related research in the United States. U.S. companies such as Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), headquartered in Beijing, have also played a crucial role in nurturing Chinese talent in AI. Several former MSRA researchers have gone on to spearhead China\u2019s technological development in leading companies such as Baidu.24 Against the background of growing mistrust between the United States and China, these forms of cooperation are suffering, resulting in rethinking existing ties in areas of technological collaboration.\n\nOver the long run, ongoing technological decoupling could contribute to a bifurcation of digital ecosystems. The Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s (BIS) Entity List arguably contributes to these developments by blacklisting entities on the list from doing business with U.S. enterprises. In terms of software, these developments are already happening. Google, for example, stopped providing access to its Android operating system (OS) to Huawei after the company was placed on the Entity List. These developments caused Huawei\u2019s sales of smartphones to plummet on international markets due to a sudden lack of access to Android\u2019s (OS) and app store, hurting interoperability between hardware and apps and services.25 These developments have resulted in Huawei doubling down on developing its own proprietary operating system, HarmonyOS, for use across its products.26\n\nIn terms of AI-related regulation, the U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act was reintroduced in 2022, but it has not been approved in either the Senate or the House of Representatives, where it was first introduced in 2019. Should the Act be passed, it would require companies that develop, sell, and use automated systems to be subject to new rules related to transparency and when and how AI systems are used. In the absence of national legislation, some states and cities have started to implement their own regulations, such as New York City\u2019s Law on Automated Employment Decision Tools. The law stipulates that any automated hiring system used on or after January 1, 2023, in NYC, must undergo a bias audit consisting of an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor, including testing to assess potential disparate impact on some groups.27\n\nChina: a budding AI governance regime\nChina\u2019s approach to AI legislation is evolving rapidly and is heavily based on central government guidance. Implementing China\u2019s national AI strategy in 201728 was a crucial step in moving the country from a lax governance regime to establishing stricter enforcement mechanisms across data and algorithmic oversight. In 2021, China implemented the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), a national data regulation inspired by the GDPR. PIPL entails that companies operating in China must classify and store their data locally within the country\u2014an element critical in establishing digital sovereignty. Under the law, companies that process data categorized as \u201csensitive personal information\u201d must seek separate consent from these individuals, state why they process this data, and explain any effects of data-related decision-making. Like the GDPR, PIPL gives China\u2019s consumers increased rights while companies have become subject to stricter national oversight and data-related controls, enhancing trust in the digital economy.\n\nIn terms of AI regulation, China oversees recommender engines through the \u201cInternet Information Service Algorithmic Recommendation Management Provisions\u201d29 which went into effect in March 2022, the first regulation of its kind worldwide. The law gives users new rights, including the ability to opt-out of using recommendation algorithms and delete user data. It also creates higher transparency regarding where and how recommender engines are used. The regulation goes further, however, with its content moderation provisions, which require private companies to actively promote \u201cpositive\u201d information that follows the official line of the Communist Party. It includes promoting patriotic, family-friendly content and focusing on positive stories aligned with the party\u2019s core values.30 Extravagance, over-consumption, antisocial behavior, excessive interest in celebrities, and political activism are subject to stricter control: Platforms are expected to intervene actively and regulate this behavior.31 Therefore, China\u2019s regulation of recommendation algorithms goes far beyond the digital space by dictating what type of behavior China\u2019s central government considers favorable or not in society.\n\nUnlike the United States, Chinese regulations put the responsibility on private companies to moderate, ban, or promote certain types of content. However, China\u2019s regulation of recommender engines can be complicated\u2014both for companies to implement and for regulators to enforce\u2014because the law often may be interpreted arbitrarily.32 The regulation could further accelerate the decoupling of practices for companies operating in China and international markets.\n\nIn terms of innovation, China\u2019s central government has strengthened private partnerships with China\u2019s leading technology companies. Several private companies, including Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei, and SenseTime, among others, have been elevated to \u201cnational champions\u201d or informally to members of China\u2019s \u201cnational AI team\u201d33 responsible for strengthening China\u2019s AI ecosystem.34\n\nThe result is that technology giants such as Baidu, Alibaba, and others have moved into the upper echelons of China\u2019s centrally planned economy. And precisely because of these companies\u2019 importance to the social and economic development of the country, the government is bringing them closer to the long-term strategic goals of the Communist Party. These developments include experimenting with mixed forms of ownership, for example where government agencies acquire minority stakes in private companies through state-run private equity funds and then fill board seats with members of the Communist Party.35 Other measures include banning sectors that do not live up to the Party\u2019s long-term priorities. One of these was China\u2019s for-profit educational technology sector, which was banned in 2021 because the party wanted to curb inequality in education.36\n\nIn China, the state is playing a central and growing role in adopting facial recognition technologies to monitor public spaces. According to Chinese government estimates, up to 626 million facial recognition cameras were installed in the country by 2020.37 Huge public sector demand has not surprisingly contributed to making China a world leader in developing AI related to facial recognition. Meanwhile, pushback by civil society continues to play a marginal role in China compared to the United States, which makes it more difficult for the population to question the government\u2019s use of AI in society.\n\nWhile the U.S. and the EU only recently have launched new initiatives and industrial policies explicitly aimed at semiconductors, China has long nurtured its chip industry. In 2014, for instance, the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund was established to make China a world leader in all segments of the chip supply chain by 2030.38 While China still lags far behind the U.S in semiconductor development, it is an area of the AI value chain that receives continued attention from China\u2019s central government, as it is critical for the country\u2019s ambitions of achieving AI leadership by 2030.\n\nRegarding how AI intersects with social values, China\u2019s latest five-year plan states that technological development aims to promote social stability.39 Artificial intelligence should therefore be seen as a social control tool in \u201cthe great transformation of the Chinese nation,\u201d40 which implies maintaining a balance between social control and innovation.41\n\nThe desire for self-sufficiency\nThe ideological differences between the three great powers could have broader geopolitical consequences for managing AI and information technology in the years to come. Control over strategic resources, such as data, software, and hardware has become paramount to decisionmakers in the United States, the European Union, and China, resulting in a neo-mercantilist-like approach to governance of the digital space. Resurfacing neo-mercantilist ideas are most visible in the ways that trade in semiconductors is being curtailed, but they are also apparent in discussions over international data transfers, resources linked to cloud computing, the use of open-source software, and so on. These developments seem to increase fragmentation, mistrust, and geopolitical competition, as we have seen in the case of communication technologies such as 5G. The United States, Canada, England, Australia, and several European countries have excluded Chinese 5G providers, such as Huawei and ZTE, due to growing mistrust about data security and the fear of surveillance of citizens by China\u2019s central government.42\n\nAs technological decoupling deepens, China will seek to maintain its goal of achieving self-sufficiency and technical independence, especially from high-tech products originating in the United States. As recently as May 2022, China\u2019s central government ruled that central government agencies and state-subsidized companies must replace computers from foreign-owned manufacturers within two years.43 That includes phasing out Windows OS, which will be replaced by Kylin OS, developed by China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology.\n\nRegarding open-source code repositories such as GitHub (owned by Microsoft), China has also signaled that it seeks to diminish its reliance on foreign-developed open-source software. In 2020, for instance, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) publicly endorsed Gitee as the country\u2019s domestic alternative to GitHub.44 While the development of leading open-source deep learning frameworks continues to be led by U.S. technology enterprises\u2014e.g.,TensorFlow (Google) and PyTorch (Meta)\u2014Chinese alternatives developed by national champions such as PaddlePaddle (Baidu) and Mindspore (Huawei), among others, are growing in scope and importance within China. These developments illustrate that achieving self-sufficiency in open-source software development such as deep learning frameworks are on the political agenda of China\u2019s central government, feeding into its long-term desire for achieving digital sovereignty.\n\nCertain U.S. policies, such as placing a growing number of Chinese companies on the BIS Entity List, will make it more difficult for China\u2019s central government to rely on strategic technical components from the United States as part of the country\u2019s economic growth strategy, thus incentivizing China to continue toward its goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency. These developments mean that previous forms of cooperation across the Pacific, e.g., in terms of academic research and corporate R&D, are quietly diminishing. These developments may complicate the possibilities for finding new international solutions to harmonization of AI use and legislation.\n\nWhile the U.S. and EU diverge on AI regulation, focused on self-regulation versus comprehensive regulation of the digital space, respectively, they continue to share a fundamental approach to artificial intelligence based on respect for human rights. This approach is now slowly being operationalized to condemn the use of AI for social surveillance and control purposes, as witnessed in China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries. To some extent, \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cEuropean\u201d values are evolving into an ideological mechanism that aims to ensure a human rights-centered approach to the role and use of AI.45 Put differently, an alliance is currently forming around a human rights-oriented view of socio-technical governance, which is embraced and encouraged by like-minded democratic nations. This view strongly informs how public sector authorities should relate to and handle the use of AI and information technology in society.\n\nWhere are we headed?\nOn May 15, 2022, the United States and EU TTC held its second summit, this time in Saclay, a suburb of Paris and one of France\u2019s leading research and business clusters. Secretary Blinken and Vice President Vestager met again to promote transatlantic cooperation and democratic approaches to trade, technology, and security. The meeting ultimately strengthened the strategic relationship across the Atlantic in several specific areas, including engaging in more detailed information exchange on exports of critical technology to authoritarian regimes such as Russia. The United States and the EU will also engage in greater coordination of developing evaluation and measurement tools that contribute to credible AI, risk management, and privacy-enhancing technologies. A Strategic Standardization Information (SSI) mechanism will also be set up to enable greater exchange of information on international technology standards\u2014an area in which China is expanding its influence. In addition, an early warning system is being discussed to better predict and address potential disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain. This discussion includes developing a transatlantic approach to continued investment in long-term security in supply for the EU\/U.S. market.46\n\nWhile the TTC is slowly cementing the importance of the U.S. and the EU\u2019s democratic transatlantic alliance in artificial intelligence, the gap between the U.S. and China seems to widen. The world is, therefore, quietly moving away from a liberal orientation based on global interoperability, while technological development increasingly is entangled in competition between the governments of the United States and China. These developments diminish the prospects for finding international forms of cooperation on AI governance,47 and could contribute to a Balkanization of technological ecosystems. The result, already partially underway, would be the emergence of a \u201cChinese\u201d network and its digital ecosystem, a U.S. and a European one, each with its own rules and governing idiosyncrasies. In the long run, this may mean that it will be much more difficult to agree on how more complicated forms of artificial intelligence should be regulated and governed. At present, the EU and China do seem to agree on taking a more active approach to regulating AI and digital ecosystems relative to the U.S. This could change, however, if the U.S. were to pass the Algorithmic Accountability Act. Like the EU AI Act, the Algorithmic Accountability Act requires organizations to perform impact assessments of their AI systems before and after deployment, including providing more detailed descriptions on data, algorithmic behavior, and forms of oversight.\n\nShould the U.S. choose to adopt the Algorithmic Accountability Act, the regulatory approaches of the EU and the U.S. would be better aligned. Even though regulatory regimes may align over time, the current trajectory of digital fragmentation between the EU and US on one side, and China on the other, is set to continue under the current political climate.\n\nUndoubtedly, AI will continue to revolutionize society in the coming decades. However, it remains uncertain whether the world\u2019s countries can agree on how technology should be implemented for the greatest possible societal benefit. As stronger forms of AI continue to emerge across a wider range of use cases, securing AI alignment at the international level, could be one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Croatia, the European Union\u2019s newest member, adopted the euro as its currency on Jan. 1, making it the 20th country to join the euro area. The move vaulted the nation of around 4 million people into the EU\u2019s core, making payments easier and cheaper and giving its financial system a safety net in future crises. The country, with an economy highly dependent on foreign tourists, also joined the Schengen zone, which allows easier travel around Europe. \n\nGet a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.\n1. Why did Croatia join the euro?\n\nCroatia began its push to join the single currency as soon as it won membership in the EU in 2013. The move is partly aimed at cementing a Western alignment after about half a century of communist rule following World War II as part of Yugoslavia. (Its accession had been delayed by the bloody wars in the 1990s around the disintegration of that country.)    \n\n2. What about the economic logic?\n\nThat\u2019s arguably even more compelling. The country relies more than any other EU state on tourists, who generate a fifth of gross domestic product and find vacationing much easier when they don\u2019t have to grapple with exchange rates. Meanwhile, most private and corporate bank deposits in Croatia are held in euros, along with more than two-thirds of debt totaling about 520 billion kuna ($74 billion). Euro-area membership can lower interest rates, improve credit ratings and make Croatia more attractive to investors, according to central bank Governor Boris Vujcic.\n\n3. What are the pros?\n\nAdopting the euro formalizes a chunk of economic activity that\u2019s already carried out using the common currency \u2014 from apartment and car sales to short-term rentals for vacationers. It trims foreign-exchange costs outside tourism to the tune of about 1.2 billion kuna a year, according to the central bank. Croatia gains access to European Central Bank liquidity and potential bailout financing from the European Stability Mechanism during periods of crisis. With Greece\u2019s troubles now largely in the rear-view mirror, there was popular support to switch to the euro. Almost all political parties backed the move. Eastern European peers Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia had already joined the single currency. ECB President Christine Lagarde said Croatia\u2019s access proves that the euro has lasting appeal.\n\n\n\n4. And the cons?\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, there\u2019s not much to lose by relinquishing control to the ECB since the kuna\u2019s exchange rate has been locked in a tight trading band to the euro and, before that, to the Deutsche Mark since the 1990s. Croatia\u2019s euro adoption will cost local banks about 1 billion kuna annually in lost conversion fees, but the switch reduces currency risks and improves stability, according to the national association of banks. The euro is also expected to have cost banks \u20ac80 million to 100 million in one-time expenditure to adapt their IT services and ATM networks. \n\n5. What hurdles did it face? \n\nEU member states gave their final approval for Croatia to join the euro on July 12, 2022. Inflation has proved the biggest challenge after the war in Ukraine sent prices of energy and other commodities soaring. But that\u2019s a problem everywhere: The pace of inflation in the euro area dropped in November, the most recent data, but consumer prices still soared 10.1% from a year earlier. \n\n\n6. What other countries want to join the euro?\n\nOne certainly does: Bulgaria. But it has pushed back its timetable by a year to 2024 after being accepted into the euro-area waiting room known as ERM-2 in 2020, the same time as Croatia. Romania has also expressed a desire. However, the biggest countries in the region aren\u2019t rushing to join, despite their obligations under EU treaties. Poland, for example, attributes its ability to survive the 2008 global financial crisis without a recession to it having retained an independent monetary policy.\n\n7. What do Croatia\u2019s new coins look like?\n\nThe coins feature a map of the country and the national checkerboard motif. They also have images of a kuna, or weasel, and feature inventor Nikola Tesla, an ethnic Serb born in the present-day Croatian town of Smiljan. Serbia\u2019s central bank had said it would take action if Croatia was allowed to use Tesla\u2019s image. \n\n\n8. What\u2019s the Schengen area?\n\nThe Schengen area allows people to travel between member countries without needing to show passports or go through border controls. It started in 1985 with five countries \u2014 France, Germany, Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg \u2014 and with the addition of Croatia now numbers 27 countries, most of which are also EU members. The European Commission calls it a common \u201carea of values, freedom, security and justice.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Bloomberg articles on the European Commission\u2019s recommendation on Croatia, the country\u2019s central bank urging citizens to move their savings into banks, and its plans for euro coins.\n\n\u2022 A Bruegel analysis of the euro coming of age.\n\n\u2022 A Brookings Institution study on whether European integration increases people\u2019s life satisfaction in Croatia and elsewhere.\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues","investments"]}
{"text":"Recent organizing victories at high-profile, private-sector employers such as Amazon, Starbucks and Trader Joe's suggest that U.S. workers can form unions in industries previously considered unorganizable.\n\nDespite the wins, unions often don't reach legally binding collective bargaining agreements with employers that give workers more say about pay, benefits and protections.\n\nIn fact, new ILR research finds that the odds of winning a first contract within 18 months of employees voting to form a union decrease by about 71% when an employer impedes contract negotiations by committing unfair labor practices.\n\nPublished February 25 in the Industrial Relations Journal, \"Breaking the deadlock: How union and employer tactics affect first contract achievement,\" was co-authored by ILR Ph.D. students Johnnie Kallas and Dongwoo Park, and University of Windsor Assistant Professor Rachel Aleks.\n\n\"A lot of people assume, and rightfully so, that if you win a union election, you should be able to negotiate a contract. But the reality is that less than half have a contract one year after an election,\" Kallas said. \"We have nothing in U.S. labor law to compel an employer to reach agreement on a first contract, which is really the problem that a lot of current organizing campaigns are coming up against.\n\n\"So, just because you win an election doesn't mean you're able to make tangible gains at your workplace. You need to then, after winning a grueling election, be able to negotiate a first contract. It's a distinct process that comes with its own challenges, which we try to demonstrate in our paper.\"\n\nEmployer opposition has a negative effect on unions achieving a first contract, researchers said. Many engage in illegal tactics, called unfair labor practices, such as spreading rumors about job loss and plant closings. They also use legal means, such as captive audience meetings, to delay the process.\n\nIn 39% of cases, employers retained the use of an anti\u2010union consultant and engaged in tactics to minimize support for the union even after union certification. These tactics, including making promises, unilaterally changing terms and conditions of work, and threatening closure, were used in 38%, 32% and 25% of cases, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, researchers found that engaging with the public, similar to the effort needed for winning worker approval for forming a union, improves the chances of establishing an agreement.\n\nThe researchers argue that for unions to achieve a first contract, workers should build external leverage by mobilizing community leaders and workers at other unionized sites. Examples of this strategy yielding positive results include the Maine State Nurses Association, which ratified its first contract in September 2022 after holding a series of public rallies, and a first contract achieved by graduate students at Clark University in October 2022.\n\nPark said, \"Unions need to get a first contract, so they may want to call a strike or just talk to the employers privately. But what we found is that what is more important than those kinds of internal tactics is the need to involve community groups, or other groups outside the union, to build solidarity, make their case more visible and to bring shame to the employers.\"\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"Stories of supply chain snarls have been making headlines since the start of the pandemic. They\u2019ve caused delays, driven up the price of goods, and led to high-profile confrontations between the industry and its labor unions. Now, the shutdown of a major US freight trucking giant is the latest sign of the shipping sector\u2019s long-haul troubles.\n\nYellow, a 99-year-old trucking company based in Nashville, Tennessee, filed for bankruptcy this week, just a few years after it received a $700 million government loan through the pandemic-relief CARES Act under President Trump, and months into heated contract negotiations with the Teamsters, the union representing the majority of Yellow\u2019s workforce. The bankruptcy has inflamed a blame game around why the once-thriving trucking company buckled, with some politicians finding fault with government bailouts that merely delay the inevitable doom for struggling companies, and others \u2014 including Yellow \u2014 pointing the finger at organized labor.\n\nYellow\u2019s downfall raises many questions about what it means for its 30,000 employees, for taxpayers, and for consumers who have already watched the price of everyday items climb amid supply chain disruptions. Sorting out its assets and dealing with freight that remains to be delivered will take some time, resulting in tie-ups. Some supply chain clients expected this and had already left for more expensive competitors \u2014 meaning consumer prices could rise.\n\nWhile the closure of one shipping industry leader doesn\u2019t mean the average consumer is suddenly going to see emptier store shelves, Yellow\u2019s bankruptcy is a sign that the industry\u2019s woes aren\u2019t going away anytime soon: It\u2019s a hyper-competitive landscape with high operational costs, including expensive fuel and pay for an army of human drivers. Trucking needs a hefty workforce to avoid disruptions to its always-on-the-move business, yet for years it has been beleaguered by a driver shortage.\n\nWith Yellow\u2019s shuttering, consumers could eventually see the ripple effects in what it costs to buy items and have them delivered \u2014 even more than they already have \u2014 as the push-and-pull between freight companies trying to turn a profit and workers asking to be paid adequately for their labor plays out again and again.\n\nYellow\u2019s fraught freight history\nYellow, which was formerly known as YRC Freight, was one of the largest \u201cless-than-load\u201d (LTL) transport companies in the US. These are businesses that deliver smaller quantities of freight, somewhere between full-trailer truckloads and individual parcel shipping (like the kind that carries your Amazon package). Yellow made up about 9 percent of the LTL market, according to the industry publication FreightWaves. It was the third-largest LTL company in the nation \u2014 other top LTL shippers include FedEx Freight, XPO, and Old Dominion Freight Line \u2014 delivering industrial, commercial, and retail goods across a wide range of sectors, including the defense and aerospace industries, automotive manufacturers, oil and gas companies, and health care, according to its website.\n\n\nIts size and history is partly why its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is big news \u2014 yet the bankruptcy may not have come as a surprise to anyone who\u2019s been watching the logistics industry, or Yellow specifically, over the past decade and a half. The company made a few expensive acquisitions in the early 2000s; then the 2008 financial crisis hit and customers fled, and it reported a net loss of nearly $1 billion that year. Yellow almost filed for bankruptcy the following year, avoiding it only after its employees took pay cuts. It considered bankruptcy again in 2014 and in 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t too many companies out there that have got a 99-year history and 30,000 workers,\u201d says Ryan Patel, a senior fellow at the Claremont Graduate University\u2019s Drucker School of Management with expertise in challenges facing the global supply chain. \u201cThat less-than-truckload concept was what they were initially the leaders of, but over time, there were a lot more players coming into it.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, particularly during union contract negotiations, there were signs that Yellow was on the verge of buckling again. Its creditors number over 100,000 and include the likes of Amazon, according to a New York Times report. It failed to make recent payments into the employee pension fund, owing about $50 million \u2014 which almost resulted in a strike, before the union agreed to give the company more time to make the payments. The looming strike set off alarm bells, and Yellow\u2019s delivery volume fell 80 percent as customers fled. Then, last week, the Teamsters were notified that the company would be shutting down.\n\nMuch of the public discussion around Yellow\u2019s shutdown has centered not on the bankruptcy itself, but on the $700 million loan the federal government handed it in 2020 \u2014 a bailout that has drawn scrutiny for years. A recent Congressional Oversight Commission report found that Yellow didn\u2019t qualify for the CARES Act loan as a company vital to US national security interests, as the legislation stated \u2014 Yellow often delivered to military bases around the country, but the congressional committee\u2019s final report determined that other freight trucking companies could have provided those delivery services. In fact, almost all of the money set aside in the CARES Act for businesses important to \u201cnational security\u201d went to Yellow. It also should have been ineligible because it was already in poor financial condition prior to the pandemic.\n\n\nAt the time of the bankruptcy filing, it had repaid just $230 of the loan\u2019s principal. The loan came with a low interest rate in exchange for a near 30 percent equity stake for the US Treasury. Yellow says it intends to repay the CARES Act loan in full.\n\nHow Yellow\u2019s labor disputes escalated\nDespite the lifelines it had been thrown, Yellow remained in grim financial straits. As debt mounted and Yellow became increasingly cash-strapped, labor negotiations grew tense. About 22,000 of its 30,000 total workforce are union members. In recent months, the company began bargaining for its next contract, with the current one set to expire in March 2024, but the two sides stood far apart on key issues, including an $11-per-hour pay increase over the next five years, pension fund payments, and some operational changes at the company.\n\nIn June, Yellow filed a lawsuit against the union for blocking the restructure of the company, claiming that its obstruction had cost the company $137 million. The Teamsters denied the claim. \u201cAfter decades of gross mismanagement, Yellow blew through a $700 million bailout from the federal government, and now it wants workers to foot the bill,\u201d Teamsters general president Sean O\u2019Brien said in a statement. The union, for its part, has sued Yellow, alleging it failed to provide the required notice for mass layoffs.\n\nYellow CEO Darren Hawkins, whom the company paid a total of $1.27 million last year according to public filings, was also quick to blame the Teamsters during the bankruptcy announcement, saying in a statement that \u201call workers and employers should take note of our experience\u201d with the Teamsters and \u201cworry.\u201d \u201cA company has the right to manage its own operations, but as we have experienced, [union] leadership was able to halt our business plan, literally driving our company out of business, despite every effort to work with them,\u201d he continued.\n\nLabor has long been a major presence in the logistics industry \u2014 there are about 340,000 union UPS workers, for example \u2014 but unionized drivers and dock workers have become less common since the deregulation of the trucking industry in the 1980s. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more competition now,\u201d says Patel \u2014 competition that often uses cheaper, non-union labor.

{"text":"CHINA TECH\nAlibaba execs called in by Shanghai authorities over police data heist\nHacker claims info on 1bn people taken from company server\n\nCISSY ZHOU, Nikkei staff writer\nJuly 15, 2022 22:50 JST\nHONG KONG -- Executives and senior technicians from Alibaba Group Holding were summoned by Shanghai police on July 3 after the law enforcement agency suffered what appears to be one of the biggest data breaches in history, individuals briefed on the matter tell Nikkei Asia.\n\nThe technicians, from Alibaba's offices in Shanghai and Hangzhou, are cooperating with the police in addressing the data breach, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity.\n\nAlibaba shares closed at 102.2 Hong Kong dollars Friday, tumbling 5.98% following the initial report by The Wall Street Journal of executives from the Chinese technology company being called in by police.\n\nIn late June, information from the Shanghai police database -- including names, ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses, criminal records and even online orders -- was offered for sale online by an unidentified hacker nicknamed \"ChinaDan.\"\n\nThe hacker claimed the data contains information about 1 billion Chinese citizens and came from an Alibaba private cloud server, but did not say how the database was obtained. The hacker included a sample of 750,000 records, some of which appear to be authentic.\n\nThe database, which spans 1995 to 2019, would be sold for 10 bitcoin, or about $200,000, according to a post in a hackers forum.\n\nThe post was deleted one week later. The hackers website published a statement in Chinese.\n\n\"Hello, dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted,\" the statement read.\n\nThe New York Times, citing cybersecurity consultancy Security Discovery, said the Shanghai police data had been stored on a secure, closed network until a gateway was created, essentially punching a hole in the firewall. Such gateways are a common practice for developers to easily access the database. But such gateways should be protected by passwords, which were lacking in the case of the Shanghai database.\n\nAn industry expert told Nikkei that multiple types of contracted companies were involved in managing the Shanghai police database, so it is unclear whether Alibaba, agency authorities or other contracted companies should be held accountable for the leak.\n\nAlibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chinese authorities have said nothing about the leak. Search results for terms such as \"Shanghai police database,\" \"Shanghai 1 billion\" or \"1 billion data leak\" were blocked in Weibo, China's heavily censored equivalent of Twitter.\n\nChina has enacted laws to protect data and personal information, but these mainly target the country's big internet and tech companies. The country's largest ride-hailing app, Didi Global, delisted from the New York Stock Exchange last month after Chinese authorities raised concerns about data leaks.\n","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Uber must face a lawsuit filed by an UberEats driver back in 2019 as there\u2019s nothing in a unique California law that prevents the worker from pursuing his legal case, the California Supreme Court ruled on Monday.\n\nUberEats driver Erik Adolph did not give up his right under state law to sue on behalf of a large group of workers even though he signed an agreement to bring his own work-related legal claims in private arbitration, the court unanimously ruled, according to a Reuters report published on Yahoo! Finance.\n\nAdolph sued Uber in 2019, claiming the company misclassified UberEats drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. He claims these drivers must be reimbursed for work expenses under California law.\n\n\nIndependent contractors classification\nIn 2021, UberEats overhauled its business model and changed its contracts with delivery drivers amid growing pressure over the status of workers. The change would make it easier for the company to classify riders and drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees \u2013 an issue that has been challenged in court on several occasions.\n\nUnder the Private Attorney General Act, or PAGA, workers can sue for employment law violations on behalf of the state and keep one-quarter of any money they win. The rest goes to the state to fund an agency that enforces labor laws.\n\nNothing in that law prevents workers from pursuing claims on their own behalf in arbitration while separately litigating large-scale claims in court, the court said, according to the Reuters report published on Yahoo! Finance.\n\nMore than half of private sector, nonunion U.S. workers are required to sign arbitration agreements as a condition of employment. And the agreements typically bar them from filing or participating in traditional class action lawsuits, according to the report.\n\nIn 2020 however, the Fair Work Commission in Australia ruled that drivers who deliver food through online service UberEats are to be considered independent contractors \u2013 not employees of the company \u2013 owing to the flexibility of their work arrangement.\n\nPushback from employers\nMichael Rubin, who represents Adolph, said the ruling could spur companies to reconsider forcing workers' claims into arbitration if large-scale PAGA lawsuits can still proceed in court.\n\nWhile the decision may be considered a win for workers, employers expressed concerns about its possible repercussions, according to the Reuters report.\n\nThe ruling conflicts with the Viking River decision and violates a federal law that requires enforcing valid arbitration agreements, claimed Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for Uber.\n\n\"We are considering our appellate options,\" she said.\n\nA 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving Viking River Cruises said that companies could force individual PAGA claims into arbitration.\n\nSeveral groups \u2013 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2013 filed briefs in Monday's case, telling the California Supreme Court that a ruling against Uber could encourage workers to file meritless lawsuits and pressure companies to settle them.\n\nHowever, those concerns should be directed at state legislators, who have the power to change the law, the court said.\n\nIn February this year, Uber drivers across New Zealand initiated their first-ever collective bargaining agreement with the service- and ride-hailing giant in a bid to hike wages and improve working conditions.\n\n","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"No one wants a hurricane to make landfall. Among nature\u2019s most damaging events, hurricanes that hit land in the United States usually cause death, destruction and misery. They can also cause havoc to supply chains. \n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina was a 100,000-truckload event, requiring one of the largest relief and recovery supply deployments in U.S. history. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey prompted one of the greatest truck capacity crunches in recent history. \n\nHurricane Lee could cause massive supply chain disruptions if it lands in the United States\nHurricane Lee, which strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane on Wednesday, will likely become a major hurricane by Friday and a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150 mph by Saturday.\n\nLee is now in the Atlantic Ocean well east of any land. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects Lee to intensify quickly and become an extremely dangerous major hurricane. At this time, it is too early to know if Lee will hit any of the major Caribbean islands or the United States.\n\nHowever, if Lee \u2014 or any major hurricane \u2014 did make landfall near a major city, it could cause massive capacity disruptions for U.S. shippers just prior to the peak season run-up.\n\nIf a major hurricane is forecast to make landfall, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state-level agencies will soak up every available truck in the market for relief activities. \n\n\n\nShippers will face much higher freight rates. Shippers would be wise to lock in secure commitments (even at higher contract rates) for a potentially chaotic fourth quarter. At worst, they may be left without trucks to haul goods.\n\nHurricanes create massive demand surges. Rates that shippers locked in to carriers anticipating a slow second half may not work in a tight capacity environment. Many carriers will chase the higher-paying FEMA freight, often ditching shippers that they view as cheap or undesirable.\n\nFor shippers unsure about what to pay in the market, they could resort to high-frequency freight rate benchmarking tools, such as SONAR, or the implementation of index-linked contracts. \n\nImpact on infrastructure\nDepending on where a hurricane hits and its subsequent path over land, a variety of infrastructure can be impacted. Seaports in the path of a hurricane close and may take time to reopen, particularly if there is any damage. The same is true for airports, rail yards and track and certainly bridges and highways. \n\nSome hurricanes have done significant damage to key infrastructure, while others have done very little damage. \n\nRegardless, these storms usually impact key parts of a state\u2019s or region\u2019s infrastructure, if only in the sense of delays. Supply chains break down because of hurricanes; sometimes they are back up and running quickly, while at other times they can be subject to significant delays. \n\n\nHurricane relief efforts\nYears before founding FreightWaves, I ran Xpress Direct from 2002 to 2005. Xpress Direct was the on-demand emergency unit of U.S. Xpress. Over the course of four years dealing with hurricane activity, Xpress Direct handled in excess of 20,000 shipments and billed over $100 million in revenue in disaster-relief loads alone.\n\nHurricane-relief loads offer an opportunity for trucking companies to demonstrate to the public how critical trucking is, regardless of how challenging a mission might be. \n\nHurricane relief is the biggest dog-and-pony show you will ever see in trucking. But there is a certain satisfaction in being able to help people who are suffering.\n\nFreightWaves\u2019 ongoing coverage\nSince FreightWaves.com went online in 2017, it has covered the impact to the nation\u2019s transportation and supply chain of all the hurricanes that have hit the United States. \n\nFreightWaves will cover Hurricane Lee\u2019s path, preparations to deal with it and more \u2014 and will continue to do so through any major relief efforts. FreightWaves will do so for any and all natural disasters that strike the nation.\n\n\nSONAR users have access to our Critical Events Center, which provides real-time information on storm paths and impacts to supply chain infrastructure.","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"Twitter Inc.\u2019s legal battles over its mass layoffs last fall continue to grow, with two more former workers filing class action complaints and approximately 2,000 ex-employees pursuing claims in individual arbitration.\n\nThe social media company owned and operated by Elon Musk\u2019s recently minted X Corp. faces challenges both in and out of court because many, but not all, of its former workers signed binding arbitration agreements. Twitter included the contracts in the packet of documents given to job applicants who were offered a position.\n\nThe outcomes of those legal fights will test the company\u2019s strategy for dealing with the fallout of its massive and sudden cuts to Twitter\u2019s workforce, particularly its handling of worker severance packages.\n\nMusk fired about half of Twitter\u2019s 7,500 workers in November, following his $44 billion purchase of the company. Layoffs continued into 2023, reportedly bringing the company\u2019s headcount under 2,000.\n\nThe layoffs and subsequent legal action are just part of the chaos that\u2019s engulfed Twitter since Musk took over in October. The company also has rolled back its expansive employee telework policy, called on workers to sign a pledge to remain at an \u201cextremely hardcore\u201d Twitter or quit, and eliminated the blue verification check marks from users\u2019 accounts unless they pay for them.\n\nProminent plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan of Lichten & Liss-Riordan PC was the first to strike at the Musk-owned Twitter, filing a lawsuit on the eve of the big November layoff alleging that the company failed to provide the legally required notices prior to mass termination.\n\nAlthough Twitter pushed that case out of court, Liss-Riordan has continued filing lawsuits. She added two more class action complaints this month, bringing her total of pending court cases against the company to eight.\n\nLiss-Riordan said her firm also represents about 1,700 ex-Twitter workers in a mass-arbitration campaign against the company.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot more work than traditional class actions,\u201d she said of the mass-arbitration approach.\n\nLiss-Riordan has 15 years of experience turning to large-scale arbitration efforts when her clients are locked out of court, staffing up and building expertise while mounting campaigns against trucking companies, gig economy firms, strip clubs, and other businesses, she said.\n\nAnd Liss-Riordan isn\u2019t alone in targeting Twitter with mass-arbitration filings.\n\nOutten & Golden LLP; Kamerman, Uncyk, Soniker & Klein PC; and the Bloom Firm PC each represent groups of about 100 former employees pursuing individual arbitrations against the company, according to attorneys at those firms.\n\nAn auto-response message from Twitter\u2019s press contact email sent a poop emoji when asked for comment on the allegations against the company.\n\nTailored Claims\nThe claims former Twitter workers brought in arbitration overlap with some of those in lawsuits.\n\nTwitter\u2019s alleged bait-and-switch on its severance package is a major focus of many arbitration cases, leading to claims of breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and unfair competition, according to lawyers representing the former Twitter workers.\n\n\nThe ex-employees allege Twitter broke its promise to provide severance packages at least as favorable as those given before Musk bought the firm. According to one lawsuit, Twitter pledged to pay a lump sum amount that would include at least two months\u2019 salary, a pro-rated bonus, cash value of equity that would have vested three months after the separation date, and money to continue health-care coverage.\n\nInstead, they say they were offered only one month\u2019s salary in exchange for a full release of any legal claims.\n\nUnlike class action complaints, which require allegations that are common to a class or subgroups of a class, claims in arbitration can be tailored to the individual plaintiff.\n\nDepending on the worker, current arbitration claims against Twitter include discrimination based on race, age, and other protected characteristics; retaliation for taking leave; failure to reimburse expenses and pay all wages on time; and violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires a certain amount of notice before a mass layoff, lawyers said.\n\nSettlement Leverage\nSome of the firms representing former Twitter staffers regularly collaborate with one another to help handle the massive amount of work triggered by mass-arbitration campaigns.\n\nAttorney Jahan Sagafi said his team at Outten & Golden has been working on Twitter arbitrations with attorneys at Kamerman Uncyk and Rudy Exelrod Zieff & Lowe LLP.\n\n\u201cA lot of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers value community and collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for the clients and the lawyers.\u201d\n\nAlthough mass arbitrations are more laborious than class actions, the cost to the companies\u2014which are generally required to foot the bill for arbitration\u2014gives plaintiffs some of the settlement leverage they could get from suing as a class. Each individual arbitration can run tens of thousands of dollars in fees.\n\nUber Technologies Inc., for example, paid at least $146 million in 2019 to resolve the bulk of the more than 60,000 arbitration claims related to drivers\u2019 alleged employment misclassification.\n\nMass arbitrations also may be more expensive to settle than class actions, said Amy Schmitz, a law professor at Ohio State University who\u2019s written extensively on arbitration.\n\nParticipating in an arbitration requires much more time and attention from a plaintiff than a class action, Schmitz said. That means plaintiffs who are willing to commit to an arbitration are often \u201csqueaky wheels\u201d who want to be involved and be heard, rather than just being in it for the money, she said.\n\n\u2018Dragging its Feet\u2019\nTwitter has responded thus far by slow walking the arbitration process, according to attorneys representing former company employees.\n\n\u201cWe are frustrated that Twitter has been dragging its feet every step of the way,\u201d said Lisa Bloom of the Bloom Firm. \u201cThey\u2019re just doing everything as slowly as possible. It\u2019s a common but frustrating tactic.\u201d\n\nThe company has delayed paying invoices and picking arbitrators, and has been asking its former workers to produce copies of their arbitration agreements, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said.\n\nAlthough defendants in arbitration have latitude to stretch out the proceedings, the Federal Arbitration Act provides a path back to court if the delay reaches a point when a defendant has effectively waived its right to arbitration.\n\nThe US Supreme Court made it easier to prove such a waiver with its 2022 decision in Morgan v. Sundance, which said a party doesn\u2019t have to show they suffered prejudice by their opponent\u2019s actions to move the dispute out of arbitration.\n\nLiss-Riordan said she\u2019s prepared to call Twitter on delays that cross a line, but the company\u2019s conduct so far is similar to other businesses facing mass arbitrations. The cases are in their early stages, with a lot more action to come, she said.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"It was a story that many saw coming, but was still shocking to read: After a year of reporting, the New York Times offered up a blistering report on how Google failed to take strong action against male executives it concluded had behaved improperly with women.\n\nWhy it matters: The story confirms a wide belief in Silicon Valley that Google is the Big Tech company with the most skeletons in its closet in this area, having been home to a number of workplace romances involving married executives.\n\nSpecifically, the Times reported that former Android boss Andy Rubin was praised and paid $90 million as part of an exit package even as an internal investigation had found credible a claim of \"sexual misconduct\" with a female employee with whom he was having an affair.\n\nOf note: The Information reported last year that Rubin's departure followed allegations of impropriety, but the Times story goes into more detail and was first to report the large severance package.\nThough the story focuses largely on Rubin, it also details other incidents at the company. These include various extramarital affairs that executives had with lower-ranking female employees and an incident in which a director propositioned a woman applying for a job.\n\nWhat's most striking from the Times story is not just the specific misdeeds. It is Google's apparent willingness to seemingly condone such actions, either by continuing to employ those found to have committed wrongdoing or by allowing them to quietly exit, sometimes with a large severance package.\n\nGoogle's response consisted largely of an email sent to its employees by CEO Sundar Pichai and HR exec Eileen Naughton. It steered clear of most of the charges in the Times piece, focusing on how the company is approaching things now.\n\n\"In recent years, we\u2019ve made a number of changes, including taking an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority: in the last two years, 48 people have been terminated for sexual harassment, including 13 who were senior managers and above.

{"text":"The pandemic shone a spotlight on the medical waste generated by stretched hospitals. The healthcare sector's decarbonisation efforts continue to be hampered by cost, habits and a lack of data.\nCovid-19 medical workers vaccine Philippines\n\nSept. 8, 2023\nThe world breathed a collective sigh of relief earlier this year, when Covid-19 was declassified as a global health emergency.\n\nHastily erected vaccination and test centres around the world were taken down after three years, as the last waves of winter infections tapered off. Heaps of medical waste \u2013 syringes, masks, scrubs \u2013 were incinerated and landfilled. More were dredged up in rivers and oceans.\nAs nations counted losses and devised plans to beef up health systems, many also pledged to redouble efforts to make the profession more sustainable.\n\nHealthcare\u2019s outsized impact on the environment was a known concern before the pandemic struck. A 2019 report found that the sector contributed to over 4 per cent of global emissions \u2013 more than other sectors like shipping (3 per cent), aviation (2 per cent) and hotels (1 per cent).\n\nIn rapidly developing but cash-strapped Southeast Asia, the struggle to strengthen while cleaning up healthcare could pitch different aspects of sustainable development \u2013 well-being and the environment \u2013 against each other.\n\nAs it stands, healthcare in Southeast Asia is not a big greenhouse gas contributor. The six largest markets, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, spewed 63 million tonnes of emissions in 2014, or 3 per cent of the industry globally. Indonesia has one of the lowest per-capita medical emissions in the world.\n\nBut healthcare emissions are known to grow with national wealth; Southeast Asia\u2019s economy has grown by 50 per cent in the nine years since. By comparison, healthcare already accounts for 8.5 per cent of emissions in the United States.\n\nExperts in the region say getting cost-conscious hospitals to move faster on sustainability remains challenging after the pandemic. While some have found good business cases in slashing waste and switching to clean electricity, scaling up these efforts requires a larger-scale overhaul of hospital operations, they say.\n\nAnd while certain aspects of healthcare \u2013 operating theatres, powerful scanners and such \u2013 are inherently power-hungry, habits and a lack of data could also be getting in the way of decarbonisation.\n\nBusiness case\n\u201cMost of Southeast Asia\u2019s public health systems don\u2019t have enough funding to continue operating at normal levels [post Covid-19]. Convincing them to do decarbonisation work with limited resources is a bit of a challenge,\u201d said Manjit Sohal, regional climate manager in the Asia branch of Health Care Without Harm.\n\nSo the global non-profit is helping hospitals find ways sustainability can also save money. In Southeast Asia, it advocates for measures such as switching to energy efficient lights and adopting solar energy, where upfront investments can be offset later with lower power bills.\n\n\u201cYou really have to give [hospitals] a good business case on why they should adopt [certain measures],\u201d Sohal said.\n\nCOVID-19 Frontline Health Workers Thailand\nHealthcare workers in medical garb at the Thailand Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute during the Covid-19 outbreak. Image: Flickr\/ UN Women Asia and the Pacific.\n\nFinding cost savings in sustainability is something Mary Johnston Hospital, a 120-bed facility in Manila city in the Philippines, has had some success with.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the hospital sanitised and reused medical protective gear up to three times before disposal, at a time when some equipment was so short in supply that they could only be found on the black market at triple the price.\n\nIn recent years, the thousand-odd solar panels on its rooftop have also been able to provide up to 35 per cent of the hospital\u2019s power needs. The institution has been diverting 5 to 10 per cent of the savings to funding treatment for HIV and tuberculosis patients.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to save the environment and save people at the same time,\u201d said Dr Glenn Paraso, the hospital\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe photovoltaic panels had cost about \u20b127 million (US$480,000), which the hospital amortised over five years, but cost savings would be made for 25 years, the lifespan of the panels, Paraso said. Some of the cells also came about via partnerships and donations from church networks the Methodist hospital is part of.\n\nOther sustainability attempts have been more difficult. Mary Johnston hospital had explored replacing plastic intravenous (IV) drip bags with reusable glass ones, but upfront costs would have doubled for the essential tool.\n\n\u201cWhat could I do? Can I pass [the cost] on to our patients?\u201d Paraso said.\n\nA switch to more sustainable hospital equipment could be significant \u2013 over 70 per cent of healthcare emissions globally come from \u201cScope 3\u201d, or indirect supply chain sources.\n\nBeyond IV bottles, reusable equipment \u2013 scalpels, syringes, tweezers \u2013 remains available in the region, experts tell Eco-Business, though they are quickly being replaced by disposable plastic equivalents, and one-time use kits, which are cheaper and more handy for doctors.\n\nBigger operational changes are needed too if more doctors switch back to reusables. While neighbourhood clinics can sanitise small tools in autoclaves \u2013 medical pressure pots for killing germs \u2013 larger, odd-sized and more sterile equipment, along with simply having more gear to clean, would require more centralised sterilisation centres to be set up, explained Dr Louis Tan, chief executive of StarMed Specialist Centre in Singapore.\n\nDisposable medical kit\nMedical equipment is increasingly sold as one-time use kits. Reusable options are still on the market today, but are more expensive and becoming less common. Image: Pxhere.\n\nData void\nNew medical trends have already started emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic, and one in particular \u2013 telemedicine \u2013 is said to reduce the environmental burden of healthcare.\n\nInitially offered to ease congestion in hospitals during the pandemic, patients have since caught on to video calling doctors for minor illnesses and simple consultations from home. Mobile healthcare application users doubled in Singapore from 2020 to 2022, consultancy Bain & Company reported. Emerging markets like Thailand and the Philippines showed greater jumps in application of over 11 and eight times, respectively.\n\nThe idea is that hospitals\u2019 Scope 3 emissions fall if they provide more telemedicine services, since fewer patients travel to doctors in person. But Tan has also seen a corresponding need for more transport services for medication delivery.\n\n\n\u201cDelivered medical items come in a lot of packaging, and the [trip down] to patients\u2019 homes could just be for a couple of tablets, or a bottle of cough syrup. I think this is starting to emerge as a potential problem,\u201d Tan said.\n\nThe bigger-picture problem, Tan explained, lies in figuring out if new sustainability measures really work for the environment and patient safety \u2013 including where reusable tools are adopted, or adopting different workflows.\n\nSuch information requires industry benchmarks and more granular research, something that healthcare institutions are not equipped for. At the same time, the medical industry operates on hard data and evidence, Tan said.\n\n\u201cIf you have the [safety and sustainability] information, no problem. But more often than not, things are evolving, and if you are at the forefront of that change, the data [isn\u2019t available]. That\u2019s why sometimes healthcare takes a longer time to adapt,\u201d he said.\n\nTo solve the accounting issue, Health Care Without Harm has developed an online calculator tailored for medical institutions, with guidance for hospitals to measure, for instance, patient commute, the use of anaesthetic vapours (some are powerful greenhouse gases), and pharmaceutical procurement.\n\nThe non-profit started training Southeast Asian medical professionals to use the calculator last year, and about 200 staff from 120 institutions have gone through the course.\n\n\u201cIn terms of who is actually reporting\u2026it is still a work in progress because getting greenhouse gas data takes a lot of time,\u201d Sohal said.\n\nBut she stresses a lack of data cannot be grounds for inaction.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at a hospital, immediately you can tell what can be improved. You don\u2019t need a set of numbers to tell you that. The numbers help you prioritise and maximise your efforts, but [the lack of which] shouldn\u2019t stop you from doing something,\u201d she said.\n\nTan agrees that there are obvious inefficiencies to fix in standard medical practice \u2013 such as prescribing patients more medication and refills than needed.\n\nFew partners\nMary Johnston Hospital\u2019s Paraso said having more hospitals on board for sustainability measures could help too \u2013 such as if collectives, with more buying power, bargain for lower prices on reusable medical tools from their suppliers.\n\nBut finding like-minded healthcare partners could prove challenging. While more hospitals are looking at using resources more efficiently, few are setting pledges and targets in stone.\n\nIn the United Nations\u2019 Race to Zero campaign, where businesses and local governors pledge action towards net-zero emissions by 2050, only 81 out of over 12,500 entities are in the healthcare sector. In contrast, there are 662 financial firms in the campaign, along with over 1,100 city governments.\n\nMary Johnston Hospital is one of the five hospitals in Southeast Asia in the Race to Zero initiative, along with Saint Paul\u2019s Hospital Iloilo (Philippines), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (Singapore), Sunway Medical Centre Velocity (Malaysia) and Syamsudin Hospital (Indonesia).\n\nThe low participation of hospitals could be partly attributed to the strict rules. The Race to Zero campaign wants members to have detailed action plans and report on progress annually \u2013 something Mary Johnston Hospital will have to start doing soon.\n\nThe campaign wants members to focus on halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050 \u2013 the best way to keep global warming under the 1.5\u00b0C safety threshold, according to scientists.\n\nParaso acknowledges such targets are, as it stands, unattainable \u2013 with at most a 10 per cent emissions cut by 2030 likely. But he says participating in the campaign is about being accountable and making measurable progress.\n\nThe health sector has a higher moral responsbility, because there is a Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. That should extend beyond the patients, to the environment that impacts patient health.\n\nManjit Sohal, regional climate manager, Health Care Without Harm Asia\n\nAt a national level, Laos, Timor Leste and Indonesia are among 66 countries that pledged to make their health systems more sustainable at the COP26 climate conference in 2021, held amid the pandemic. Laos said it would halve healthcare emissions by 2030.\n\nWhile disruptive, Covid-19 helped jolt policymakers into taking action on sustainability, Health Care Without Harm\u2019s Sohal said. Health ministries across Southeast Asia have a \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d, she said, though not all know their specific carbon footprint.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nFor now, many of the feasible sustainability actions centre around renewable energy, waste reduction and improving operational efficiency. Novel solutions, such as better hospital planning with artificial intelligence and medical gases with lower climate impacts are on the horizon.\n\nMore government support is needed to further scale up what hospitals can do, Paraso said. Solar panels probably need to get more efficient too, to further reduce the need for fossil-based power, he added.\n\nAnd because a key tenet of sustainability lies in the well-being of future generations, how much responsibility doctors assume for them \u2013 and not just present patients \u2013 could matter too.\n\nSome environmental advocacy groups in medical communities invoke in their campaigns the Hippocratic Oath, a professional pledge taken by doctors to uphold ethical standards and do no harm to patients.\n\nHealth Care Without Harm says the oath should extend to \u201cpeople and the environment in the long run\u201d. Sohal added that it means the health sector has a greater duty than other commercial sectors to decarbonise.\n\nIt is a message that may require greater amplification in Southeast Asia \u2013 the link between Hippocratic Oath and sustainability is not common talk in Tan\u2019s work circles, he says.\n\n\u201cI suppose at the working level, on the ground, it is not something that many of us are aware of,\u201d he added.\n\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"While many of the largest tech companies are joining a US corporate effort to compel employees back to the office, Atlassian is among the firms remaining steadfast backers of remote work. Atlassian has committed to a workplace model without mandatory office attendance, Annie Dean, the company\u2019s vice president of \u201cteam anywhere,\u201d said in an interview. With more than 11,000 employees, Atlassian is \u201cthe largest company in the world committed to distributed work at this scale,\u201d she said.\n\nRemote collaboration with periodic in-person gatherings boosts productivity and allows the Australian-founded software company to recruit better talent, Dean said. More than half of the people hired during the last year live over two hours from an office, she said.\n\nAlso holding out against the return-to-office movement is Airbnb Inc., which has said its roughly 6,000 employees can work from anywhere with regular meet-ups structured around product releases. Software company Twilio Inc. has no office-return rules for its 6,400 employees \u2014 about 60% of its workforce is in locations where the firm historically hasn\u2019t had offices, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lawson said in a March interview. Autodesk Inc., Dropbox Inc., Okta Inc. and Gitlab Inc. are other tech employers without mandatory office attendance.\n\n\u201cAt a time when many companies are requiring employees to return to the office a certain number of days per week, Autodesk will stay the course and has no plans for corporate return-to-office mandates for hybrid and remote-based employees, Rebecca Pearce, chief people officer at Autodesk,\u201d which had 13,7000 employees as of January, wrote in a blog post.\n\nBefore Atlassian, Dean led Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s remote work initiative. With a three-day-a-week office mandate beginning in September, the social media giant has joined the list of major employers pushing a return to the office. Amazon.com Inc. will require some corporate workers to relocate to meet new office rules. International Business Machines Corp.\u2019s Arvind Krishna said in May that promotions will be rarer for those who aren\u2019t on site. Beyond tech, companies from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to BlackRock Inc. have bumped expected in-office time to four days a week.\n\nAnd plenty of firms have backpedaled from their previous positions. Zoom Video Communications Inc. said early last year that most employees would be able to choose whether to work on site or not. Earlier this month, it mandated at least two days a week in the office. Salesforce Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff, an early public advocate of remote work, has touted the importance of collaborating in person, with some salespeople called back to company offices. \n\nThese new high-profile mandates aren\u2019t showing up in return-to-office data. Attendance was at less than half of pre-Covid levels across 10 of the largest US business districts last week, according to data from Kastle Systems. That figure is roughly unchanged compared with the start of 2023. The San Jose, California area \u2014 home to many technology companies \u2014 recorded the lowest office attendance in that period at 37.5% of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAtlassian\u2019s Dean said she doesn\u2019t anticipate that companies will uniformly march toward more restrictive office policies, adding that \u201ca lot of these decisions are not well-grounded in data.\u201d Real productivity problems include \u201cback-to-back meetings, having minimal clarity about what goals you\u2019re trying to move forward, overflowing inboxes, vague processes,\u201d none of which are fixed by simply returning to the office, she said.","labels":["None"]}
{"text":"As Russian ground troops prepared to enter Ukraine in February 2021, Ukrainian governmental departments, online media organizations, financial firms, and hosting providers were slammed with a surge of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks only increased in frequency and impact as Russian tanks rolled across the border, adding to the frenzy and chaos of that time.\n\n\nQuick to hit back, Ukraine's IT Army sprang to life during the early days of the conflict. Much like Ukraine's volunteer army on the ground, recruits flooded in from all over the world to take part in the brewing war being waged online between Russia and Ukraine, with observed DDoS attacks focused on Russian targets increasing by 236% between February and March.\n\nWhat seems clear is that whether issued by hacktivists or nation-states, DDoS attacks are often the opening salvo between opposing forces in today\u2019s geopolitical conflicts. Compared with other types of cyberthreats, DDoS attacks can be launched relatively quickly. In addition, while DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption on their own, they can also mask or distract attention from more significant threats.\n\nAnd, as seen in Ukraine and elsewhere, the use of DDoS attacks on the digital battlefield seems to be increasing. This article will examine the history of DDoS attacks for geopolitical conflict compared with recent attacks, providing insights that organizations can use to protect themselves from collateral damage.\n\n\n2022: A Record-Setting Year for DDoS\nThe use of DDoS attacks to gain geopolitical advantage is nothing new, but the frequency at which these types of attacks are growing is noteworthy. In the latest \"DDoS Threat Intelligence Report,\" Netscout reported more than 6 million attacks in the first half of 2022. Of these attacks, a majority corresponded with national or regional conflicts.\n\nTo continue with the Ukraine example, the frequency of DDoS attacks directed at Ukraine leveled off by April 2022, while cyberattacks ratcheted up against perceived allies of Ukraine. This likely is attributable to Ukrainian Internet properties migrating to countries like Ireland, as instability in the intra-Ukraine Internet forced many network segments to rely upon connectivity in other countries.\n\nEchoes of this conflict continue to resonate across the global Internet. In March 2022, India experienced a measurable increase of DDoS attacks following its abstentions from United Nations Security Council and General Assembly votes condemning Russian actions in Ukraine. Similarly, during the first half of the year, Belize endured its single highest number of DDoS attacks on the same day that it made public statements in support of Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, the nation of Finland \u2014 a close neighbor of Russia \u2014 experienced a 258% percent year-over-year increase in DDoS attacks coinciding with its announcement to apply for membership in NATO. Poland, Romania, Lithuania, and Norway, meanwhile, all were targeted with DDoS attacks by adversaries linked to Killnet, a group of online attackers aligned with Russia.\n\nBut these examples rooted in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine are not the only online battlegrounds where fights over geopolitics are being waged. As tensions between Taiwan and China and Hong Kong and China escalated during the first half of the year, DDoS attack campaigns often coincided with public events. For example, in the run-up to Nancy Pelosi's historic visit to Taiwan this summer, the website of Taiwan's presidential office and other government websites went dark due to DDoS attacks. And in Latin America, during a contentious election in Colombia this past year, waves of successive DDoS attacks were launched during the initial vote and the contested runoff.\n\nOne common thread is that many of these attacks use known attack vectors and readily available DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booter\/stressor services, found on the Dark Web. These illicit services typically offer a restricted tier of free demonstration DDoS attacks to prospective customers, lowering the bar for would-be attackers to rapidly spin up attacks at very little to no cost. However, because these attack vectors are well-known, they can be easily mitigated in most circumstances.\n\nDon't Become Collateral Damage\nDDoS attacks have the potential to seriously disrupt Internet operations for their intended targets, but they can also cause a significant collateral impact footprint for bystander organizations and Internet traffic. This risk is particularly high as data hosting and services flow from war-torn regions like Ukraine to locations abroad.\n\nIn many of the examples listed above, the effectiveness of attacks largely depended upon whether targeted organizations had organized DDoS defenses. In Ukraine and other countries, disruption was quickly remedied for unprotected organizations as global DDoS defense companies stepped in to help Ukrainian organizations that needed it. However, ongoing defenses are still needed for most organizations.\n\nAmid this environment, the most prudent course of action to prevent collateral damage is to regularly assess DDoS risk factors, especially related to direct service delivery elements, supply chain partners, and other dependencies. Organizations should ensure that critical public-facing servers, services, applications, content, and supporting infrastructure are adequately protected. They also should check to make sure DDoS defense plans reflect ideal current configurations and operational conditions, and that the plans are periodically tested to verify that they can be successfully implemented as required.\n\nIn summary, events during the last year have proven that DDoS attacks \u2014 whether launched by nation-states, ideological groups, or rogue individuals \u2014 will not diminish any time soon. DDoS remains an effective tool for disrupting networks and degrading the morale of countries embroiled in sociopolitical upheaval, with new attacks happening every day. To stay protected in this time of war and geopolitical conflict, organizations must remain vigilant in their defense.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"Take good care of your air conditioner, everyone. In a summer of record temperatures, Florida is in for more brutal heat this week with highs in the 90s and dangerously hot conditions with \"feels like\" heat indices well into triple digits across the state, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nAn excessive heat warning with heat index values up to 115 degrees is in effect across north and South Florida and Southeast Georgia from 10 a.m. EDT Tuesday until 8 p.m.\n\nAn excessive heat watch advisory has been issued for Wednesday across North Florida, with heat index values up to 113 possible.\n\nCentral Florida is under a heat advisory from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., with heat index values up to 112 expected.\n\n\nBe sure to take precautions. The danger from rising temperatures is getting worse. An average of 700 people died every year in the U.S. between 2004 and 2018 of heat-related causes, according to the CDC, and 3,066 heat-related deaths occurred during 2018-2020. According to data from the National Conference of Citizenship, heat-related deaths in Florida have increased 88% in the last three years.\n\nStay in air-conditioned spaces as much as possible, the NWS advises. Stay hydrated, and wear sunscreen and protective clothing.\n\n\nWhat is an excessive heat warning?\nNationwide, the NWS issues an Excessive Heat Warning when heat index values, the \"feels like\" temperatures, are expected to be 105-110 degrees or higher for at least two consecutive days and nighttime air temperatures will not drop below 75 degrees, depending on the local climate.\n\nDifferent areas of Florida have different criteria for issuing excessive heat warnings, such as a heat index forecast of 113 degrees or higher for at least two hours.\n\n\nA heat index of 103 to 124 degrees can cause heat cramps and heat exhaustion, the NWS said, and possible heat stroke with prolonged exposure and\/or physical activity. Heat stroke is extremely likely with heat indices over 125 degrees. If you don't take precautions immediately when conditions are extreme, you may become seriously ill or even die.\n\nOn June 1, the Miami-Dade NWS began using new heat advisory criteria for that area that lowered the range of heat indices required to more closely reflect the \"significant health impacts from heat\" that occur at lower heat index values. In that county only, excessive heat warnings are issued when the heat index reaches 110 degrees or higher for at least two hours. If this is evaluated to be more accurate, the new criteria will be rolled out to the rest of South Florida in 2024.\n\nStay cool (or less hot):As temperatures hit 'dangerously hot conditions' in Florida, here is everything to know to stay safe\n\nIf you can't stand the heat...8 tips to stay cool in the kitchen during a Florida heat wave\n\nWhat is an excessive heat watch?\nHeat index chart.\nThe NWS issues an Excessive Heat Watch when an excessive heat event is likely in the next 24 to 72 hours. Excessive heat watches are used when the timing of the heat event isn't nailed down yet.\n\nWhat is a heat advisory?\nThe NWS issues a Heat Advisory within 12 hours of the onset of dangerous heat conditions when the heat index is expected to reach 100 degrees or higher for at least two consecutive days and nighttime air temperatures will not drop below 75 degrees, depending on local climate.\n\nWhat watches and warnings have been issued in Florida?\n\nWhat is the heat index?\n\n\"It's not the heat, it's the humidity,\" as people in Florida are a little too fond of saying. For the heat index, it's both.\n\nWhile the temperature tells you how hot it is, the heat index combines the temperature and humidity levels to tell you what the temperature actually feels like outside. Weather apps and forecasters call it the \"real feel\" or \"feels like\" temperature, and it's important to know.\n\n\nWhen your body gets too hot, it cools itself off by sweating and your body's temperature reduces as the perspiration evaporates. When the relative humidity is high (that's the moisture in the atmosphere), your sweat doesn't evaporate as quickly (or at all) and you feel warmer. When humidity levels are low, your perspiration evaporates more quickly and the \"feels like\" temperature might feel even cooler than the Fahrenheit number.\n\n\"For example, if the air temperature is 100 degrees and the relative humidity is 15%,\" the National Weather Service explains on their website, \"the heat index is 96 degrees.\"\n\nKeep in mind, the heat index value is for shady locations. \"If you are exposed to direct sunlight, the heat index value can be increased by up to 15 degrees,\" the NWS said.  \n\nWhat is the difference between the heat index and the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature?\nThe Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is similar to the heat index in that it measures more than just the temperature to give you a sense of what the weather really feels like. But the WBGT measures temps in the sun, not the shade, and includes wind, cloud cover and the angle of the sun to help indicate heat stress for active populations such as outdoor workers and athletes.\n","labels":["natural_disasters"]}

{"text":"OpenAI is trying to dismiss various claims in two legal actions launched by authors and comedians, who sued the machine-learning super-lab for scraping their books to train ChatGPT without explicit permission. \n\nIn June, novelists Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in the US over its harvesting of prose. Days later, comedian Sarah Silverman and novelists Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey also sued the biz. Both parties accused the ChatGPT maker of copyright infringement for ingesting their work to train the chatbot.\n\nOpenAI's lawyers have hit back, asking a federal court in San Francisco to dismiss five out six claims brought by Tremblay and Awad, those being: vicarious infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unfair competition, negligence, and unjust enrichment. It is, however, prepared to fight the first claim of direct copyright infringement in hope of winning it to make a point to any other creative person considering pursuing it.\n\nOpenAI made the same argument against Silverman et al's federal lawsuit, too, for what it's worth.\n\n\n\n\"This motion does not seek dismissal of Count I, for direct copyright infringement, which OpenAI will seek to resolve as a matter of law at a later stage of the case,\" the lab's legal eagles argued in court filings [PDF]. The lawyers believe most of the plaintiffs' accusations do not describe any actual law-breaking by OpenAI, and rest allegedly involve the biz directly infringing on the writers' intellectual property \u2013 allegations the organization denies. \n\nLawyers for the AI biz argued OpenAI has not violated copyright laws at all and that ChatGPT is protected under fair use. US copyright law states that \"transformative uses\" of work \u2013 where the original source is repurposed \u2013 is considered fair use. Although the large language model ingested the authors and comedian's books, it transformed their text for different applications. That's the argument, anyway. \n\n\"According to the complaints, every single ChatGPT output \u2013 from a simple response to a question (e.g., 'Yes'), to the name of the president of the United States, to a paragraph describing the plot, themes, and significance of Homer's The Iliad \u2013 is necessarily an infringing 'derivative work' of plaintiffs' books,\" they wrote in the court docs.\n\n\"Worse still, each of those outputs would simultaneously be an infringing derivative of each of the millions of other individual works contained in the training corpus \u2013 regardless of whether there are any similarities between the output and the training works. That is not how copyright law works,\" they concluded.\n\nAI and copyright is a contentious legal gray area. Similar lawsuits have been filed by visual artists, who claim companies like Stability AI have trained text-to-image models on their artwork. Although the US Copyright Office has declared that works which are \"not the product of human authorship\" cannot be protected, officials are unsure about other issues.\n\nThe office issued a request for public comment [PDF] this week on copyright law and policy issues raised by AI.\n\nThe Register has asked the plaintiffs' lawyers for comment.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"Globalisation is being rewired, from how it operates to what it fundamentally means. Reshoring remains a dominant topic. Discussions at August\u2019s Jackson Hole economic symposium in the US centred around structural shifts in the global economy, with speeches focused on the looming \u201cgreat reallocation\u201d.\nBroadly speaking, data continues to highlight that companies have diversified their supply chains, with plans for much more to come. Supply chain localisation, amid trade tensions, geopolitics, energy security and the risk of supply chain disruptions, is likely to remain a key theme for the next decade.\nThe supply chain management strategies that prevailed before 2020 were focused on achieving cost efficiency. Firms scoured the globe for the cheapest suppliers, which in turn often resulted in widespread and complex supply chains that spanned national borders. Another goal was to keep inventories as lean as possible to minimise the cost of financing.\nThis move towards supply chain complexity evolved over decades, motivated in part by the rise of Japanese manufacturers whose exports were considerably more competitive than those of their rivals. One key element of this competitive advantage was the practice of \u201c just in time\u201d inventory management, which subsequently became widespread.\n\nConcurrently, policymakers\u2019 commitment to pursue a more globalised economy, including efforts to bring down tariffs and remove barriers to capital flows, contributed to vertical specialisation. This allowed firms and countries to concentrate on certain links in the supply chain.\n\nIndia, Vietnam to gain from supply chain shifts away from China\n10 Jan 2023\n\nThis trend was reinforced by a reduction in underlying transport costs, as well as advances in information and communication technology. Firms were increasingly free to seek out the world\u2019s cheapest suppliers. At the same time, this process tightened global interdependence, especially between East Asian economies and the rest of the world.\nThese approaches were conditioned on the assumption that global links were reliable, predictable and cost-effective. However, the system\u2019s vulnerabilities were highlighted by the pandemic and exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. As supply chain disruptions wove their way through the global economy, they forced companies and governments alike to rethink, reinvent and reinvest in their supply chains.\nOne highly ambitious home-shoring test case is 2022\u2019s US Chips and Science Act, which is providing some US$280 billion in new funding to bolster research and development and the United States\u2019 domestic semiconductor industry. The legislation spurred the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world\u2019s largest chip maker, to invest US$40 billion in two factories in Arizona, with the potential of greatly boosting the US\u2019 ability to craft large volumes of semiconductors.\n\nSupply chain shifts have also resulted in investments outside the US. Notably, the technology supply chain has witnessed rising investment in areas outside China for several years now.\n\nSmartphone and tech hardware assembly has been highly concentrated in China, but suppliers are working to introduce new production capacity, especially in Mexico, India and Southeast Asia, where nations such as Vietnam and Thailand should see a rise in areas of manufacturing such as wearables, electronic components and batteries.\n\nIndia is also well positioned to benefit from the pattern of shifting supply chains. The focus has been on indigenisation as the government has taken significant steps to increase exports and rationalise imports. This could help India address some of its long-standing issues, such as manufacturing\u2019s low share of GDP, which has been stuck around 15 per cent for the past decade.\nAdditionally, the country is running a high current-account deficit. But India is projected to reach US$1 trillion in goods exports by 2028, representing a steep 17 per cent increase. In addition, New Delhi aims to increase manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP to 25 per cent from the current 17.7 per cent by 2025. As part of that effort, it is addressing all its legacy bottlenecks linked to industrial production and is focusing on improving the ease of doing business.\nMobile manufacturing is one of India\u2019s success stories. It fell to insignificant levels after Nokia\u2019s India manufacturing operations shut down in the mid-2010s, but the government took measures to revitalise the sector. It introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme and raised import duties on finished mobile phones.\n\nIndia then followed up with import duties on certain components to promote the \u201cassembly, programming, testing and packaging\u201d model of manufacturing. It enjoyed some success through this initiative, with the number of mobile phone manufacturing plants rising from just two in 2014 to 105 in 2019. Production increased from US$11 billion in 2017 to US$30 billion in 2021, while exports in that time frame rose from US$200 million to US$4 billion.\n\nOther schemes with a focus on increasing scale and added value followed. India introduced the Electronics Manufacturing Cluster and a scheme to promote programmes for the manufacturing of electronic components and semiconductors in 2020, which essentially offered capital expenditure subsidies. This was followed by the Production Linked Incentive scheme to encourage local production, allowing for 4 to 6 per cent incentives on incremental indigenous production.\nReshoring, nearshoring and friend-shoring are undoubtedly in focus for the global economy, and opportunities are vast. However, supply chain rewiring is complex as it requires substantial investment and is likely to take years to bear fruit. Complexities flow from decisions made by firms about production, shipping and inventory management.\n\nProducing requires setting production plans, finding suppliers, locating workers and the decisions of millions of people about whether to enter the labour force and, if so, what job to take. Geopolitics, incentives and labour market dynamics are at play and will collectively conspire to define the real winners of this great reallocation.","labels":["supplychain"]}

The hacker ordered a new cell phone after seizing control of his cellular network account, and then ported Stephen\u2019s private cell number to a SIM in the new device, according to a lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16.\n\nThis exploit is known as a SIM-swap attack, which the Federal Bureau of Investigations warned in 2022 were increasingly common and targeted at victims who were likely to own large amounts of cryptocurrency. The FBI estimates that $72 million was stolen in SIM-swap attacks last year, up from $68 million in 2021.\n\nStephens founded Blockchain Capital in 2013 with his brother Brad Stephens. The San Francisco-based fund has since gone on to back crypto startups like Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and NFT exchange Opensea. Blockchain Capital\u2019s Twitter account was hacked earlier this month to promote a crypto token, according to Cointelegraph.\n\nStephens\u2019 lawsuit claims that the hacker used his cell phone number to reset passwords, and pass two factor authentication tests, at several unnamed digital wallets and then \u201cbegan to systematically steal plaintiff's digital assets.\u201d\n\nA day before the hacker moved $6.3 million to their private crypto wallets, they wrote to Stephens to brag that they could \u201cremotely hack anyone\u2019s phone number in the mainland U.S.\u201d in a message sent from one of his own hacked accounts to his work email.\n\nThe hacker also tried to steal bitcoin and ethereum worth $14 million from a \u201ccustodial cold wallet\u201d owned by Stephens but were blocked by a Blockchain Capital employee who had been notified of the withdrawal. \u201cThis notification was the first time that Plaintiff learned that Plaintiff\u2019s [redacted] account was under attack,\u201d Stephens\u2019 attorney wrote in the lawsuit.\n\n\nStephens\u2019 cell phone network only confirmed on May 15, a day after the funds were stolen, that he had been the victim of a SIM-swap attack. Around half of the funds were moved to cryptocurrency tumbler exchanges that mix digital assets which can help anonymise transactions, and make tracing stolen bitcoin and other coins harder. Stephens did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSIM-swap attacks typically rely on hackers manipulating or \u201csocial engineering,\u201d tricking cell phone network customer service operators into revealing personal information about a victim. The hacker then uses that information to pass security tests needed to port a victim\u2019s phone number to a new SIM card and phone in their control.\n\nIn one of the largest SIM-swap attacks to date, Florida man Nicholas Truglia was sentenced to 18 months in jail in December 2022 for the theft of over $20 million from crypto investors including Transform Ventures\u2019 Michael Terpin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStephens has long been an outspoken proponent of crypto and a foil to critics like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has repeatedly dismissed bitcoin as a fraud. \u201cI would encourage Jamie Dimon and others to do some homework first. It is not a fraud. It is not a Ponzi scheme. It\u2019s a robust technology that is going to impact multiple industries,\u201d Stephens told CNBC in 2017.\n\nSend me a secure tip. \nIain Martin\n\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"Significant ice buildup will impact truckers from Texas to Oklahoma\n\nNick Austin\n\u00b7\nMonday, October 26, 2020\n (Photo: Jim Allen\/FreightWaves)\nA high-impact winter-like storm is unfolding in the Plains and will last until Wednesday in some areas.\n\n\nSONAR Critical events and radar: Monday, Oct. 26, 2020, 12 p.m. ET\nFor the next two days, periods of heavy snowfall, freezing rain and gusty winds will stop many drivers in their tracks from the Rockies to the prairies of Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nThe most significant ice buildup of a half inch to an inch will impact drivers from northeastern Texas to much of Oklahoma. This includes the Interstate 35, 40 and 44 corridors in Oklahoma City, Wichita Falls and some Tulsa suburbs. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued an ice storm warning for these areas.\n\nDepending on location and elevation, snowfall totals in the storm\u2019s impact zone will range anywhere from just 1 or 2 inches to as much as 12 inches. In some areas, wind gusts could reach 30 mph or higher, resulting in occasional blowing snow and whiteout conditions.\n\nCold Canadian air and plenty of moisture have spread over the impact zone. The NWS expects two waves of winter precipitation to develop. The first wave was already moving through the impact zone as of midday Monday and should gradually fade by Monday evening.\n\nBetween this wave and the next one, there\u2019s potential for freezing drizzle Monday night, particularly for places in the ice storm warning. This will make driving especially dangerous on bridges and overpasses.\n\n\n\nA second wave of snow and freezing rain is expected to develop across the impact zone late Monday night to Wednesday. This wave could be worse as the freezing temperatures may spread farther to the southeast, putting more places at risk for icing.\n\n\nSONAR ticker: ITVI.OKC\n\nThere may be loose capacity (a lot of truckers) in the Oklahoma City market right now. This is based on the latest FreightWaves data showing a large spike in Inbound Tender Volume index (ITVI.OKC) over the past 10 days.

{"text":"\tThe agency created at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic to protect the UK from future viral threats has been strongly criticised by a cross-party group of MPs for its lack of governance and weak financial controls.\n\nNHS Test and Trace inventory, such as test kits and other medical equipment, worth \u00a33.3bn and transferred to the UK Health Security Agency could not be properly accounted for, according to a report published on Wednesday by the House of Commons public accounts committee.\u00a0\n\nThe findings come as the government faces recriminations over its response to the pandemic, with a public inquiry under way into the effectiveness of its preparedness and response strategy.\n\nDame Meg Hillier MP, committee chair, said it was \u201ccompletely staggering\u201d that an \u201corganisation envisaged as a foundation stone of our collective security was established with a leadership hamstrung by a lack of formal governance and financial controls so poor that billions of pounds in NHS Test and Trace inventory can no longer be properly accounted for\u201d.\n\nThe report noted a lack of adequate governance from the outset and referred to the appointment as the agency\u2019s chief executive of Dr Jenny Harries, who at the time had limited technical experience of running a complex organisation.\n\nThe committee called on the UKHSA urgently to apply robust financial controls, develop a plan to deliver complete accounts and create a stockpile of equipment and medicine in the event of another health crisis.\n\n\u201cFor the government not to make serious preparations for any future pandemic would be utterly inexcusable,\u201d Hillier said.\n\nThe UKHSA was established in April 2021 to replace Public Health England, the agency blamed by ministers for its muddled response in the first year of the pandemic.\n\nThe new organisation, which was originally called the National Institute for Health Protection, was intended to focus on health security and use scientific and health evidence to respond to future disease threats.\n\nThe department came under criticism from the National Audit Office, the independent public spending watchdog, earlier this year for failing to complete an \u201ceffective programme of year-end stock counts\u201d and for a \u201clack of adequate governance, oversight and control\u201d.\n\nRecommended\n\nUndercover EconomistTim Harford\nIs it even possible to prepare for a pandemic?\n\nThe public accounts committee also pointed to an absence of effective control over the agency\u2019s cash management processes, including a failure to perform bank reconciliations, a process used to verify bookkeeping, or to conduct stock takes on emergency stockpiles.\u00a0\n\nThe committee also found that three years after the pandemic started the Department of Health still lacked adequate controls over its stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE), and continued to incur high costs for storage and disposal of unusable items.\n\nIn the past two years the department has written off \u00a314.9bn of spending, the report found, including \u00a39.9bn worth of PPE and \u00a32.6bn of Covid-19 medicines, in part because the government overpaid for items and over-ordered.\n\nHarries said the UKHSA was \u201ccreated in unprecedented circumstances when tackling Covid was our first priority, and we inherited significant pre-existing accounts challenges without full governance autonomy\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have already instituted strong governance arrangements in a hugely complex organisation at the earliest opportunity within the controls available to us,\u201d the agency\u2019s chief executive added. \u201cDespite these inherited financial challenges, the UKHSA continues to fulfil its priority remit \u2014 to protect lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the face of an unprecedented pandemic, we had to compete in an overheated global market to procure items to protect the public, frontline health and care workers and our NHS,\u201d a government spokesperson said.\u00a0\u201cWe will consider the committee\u2019s recommendations and formally respond in due course.\u201d\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics","supplychain"]}

(Ed JONES \/ AFP)\nHackers believed to be working on behalf of North Korea have in recent years posed as recruiters and targeted workers in a variety of industries with offers of extravagant jobs at big-name firms with massive salaries. In the past, that campaign has mostly been carried out over email, but now researchers are seeing North Korean hackers shift their phishing attempts to LinkedIn and WhatsApp.\n\nBy first constructing convincing profiles on the career-focused social media platform LinkedIn, reaching out to their victims with phony job offers and convincing them to move the conversation over to WhatsApp, where they would be targeted with malware, North Korean hackers have crafted a sophisticated method for targeting computer security researchers, according to a two-part report released by Google\u2019s Mandiant on Thursday.\n\nMichael Barnhart, a principal analyst at Mandiant, describes this North Korean threat actor as \u201cone of the more skilled groups coming out of this closed off nation,\u201d and in targeting security researchers, the group deployed a range of new tools.\n\nThe group\u2019s activity \u2014 tracked as UNC2970 or TEMP.Hermit by Mandiant and included under the broader Lazarus umbrella by others \u2014 includes \u201can array of specially crafted LinkedIn accounts based on legitimate users\u201d that are \u201cwell designed and professionally curated to mimic the identities of the legitimate users in order to build rapport and increase the likelihood of conversation and interaction,\u201d Mandiant\u2019s researchers said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the attackers were successful in shifting the conversation from LinkedIn to WhatsApp, they would continue interacting with the target before sending a phishing payload disguised as a job description, the researchers said, primarily in the form of customized Microsoft Word documents embedded with macros that would pull malware a remote server. In at least one case, researchers said, the hackers \u201ccontinued interacting with a victim even after the phishing payload was executed and detected, asking for screenshots of the detection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe activity outlined here lends itself to a more espionage-oriented goal, whereas other elements within this group are strictly after crypto and revenue generation,\u201d Barnhart said in an email to CyberScoop. \u201cThis speaks to the size and priorities of this actor, which publicly aligns with the DPRK\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is widespread overlap of tooling and tactics across North Korean-aligned hacking groups, Mandiant considers TEMP.Hermit to be a distinct subset of activity under the control of the country\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau and focused on intelligence collection.\n\nMandiant\u2019s report notes that although previous campaigns focused largely on the defense, media and technology industries, this more recent effort targeted security researchers, possibly suggesting \u201ca shift in strategy or an expansion of its operations.\u201d\n\nEarlier reporting by cybersecurity firms \u2014 such as a campaign dubbed \u201cDream Job\u201d by ClearSky in 2022 \u2014 have documented how North Korean hacking groups have typically approached targets via email, allowing for a more direct delivery of customized phishing malware. But the evolution documented by Mandiant over the second half of 2022 suggests that email-based attacks are getting harder to pull off, a shift Barnhart suggest might be caused by the growing adoption of cloud infrastructure and endpoint detection and response software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nExample of one of the lure documents sent by North Korean-linked hackers (Mandiant)","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}
{"text":"As freight truck utilization continues to fall from pandemic-era capacity, more small carriers are giving up for-hire authority as equipment and other carrier costs remain higher at the start of 2023. This could be a slow, messy year for freight.\n\nThe trucking industry lost more carriers in December than any month since Hurricane Katrina disrupted much of the over-the-road freight industry, according to data fromFTR Transportation Intelligence. This followed months upon months of more new motor carriers trying to get in on the raging freight market.\n\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nMonthly net-change in U.S. for-hire carrier population, according to FMCSA data analyzed by FTR Transportation Intelligence.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking trucking, the thing that really pops out is what has happened with the carrier population base the last two and a half years,\u201d Avery Vise, FTR\u2019s VP of trucking, said during an FTR State of Freight webinar on Jan. 12.\n\n\nThe booming freight market born out of the pandemic that began nearly three years ago created a market for new for-hire carriers within a thriving spot market. During most of 2020 and 2021, hundreds to thousands of companies established for-hire authority each month. While there were fits and starts through much of 2022, Vise said the industry started losing \u201ca pretty substantial number\u201d of carriers in October.\n\n\u201cPreliminary data for December would indicate that we have lost more carriers in December than we lost in any month on record\u2014with the exception of December \u201905, which was in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and all the disruptions that led to,\u201d Vise said. \u201cThis is likely to continue for a period of time.\u201d\n\nSmaller carriers turn to driving jobs\nMost of these new and departing carriers are independent, one-truck operations, Vise noted. While smaller carriers are leaving the industry, for-hire payroll employment is leveling out its steady climb since it was knocked down by COVID-19 in March 2020.\n\n\u201cWe lost a lot of carriers in the springtime, but when you see the amount of growth we\u2019ve had in the second quarter in payroll employment, clearly what happened here is that a lot of those workers\u2014mostly drivers\u2014were absorbed into larger carriers,\u201d Vise explained. \u201cAnd we really just saw a shift of activity and capacity from the spot market into the contract market.\u201d\n\n\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nFor-hire trucking jobs, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data of trucking industry payrolls, is above pre-pandemic levels but appears to be peaking, according to FTR.\nFor-hire trucking jobs, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data of trucking industry payrolls, is above pre-pandemic levels but appears to be peaking, according to FTR.\nWhile remaining above pre-pandemic levels, Vise said new carrier numbers started to flatten when diesel prices surged and spot market rates fell in 2022. But if the current trendline continues, he expects the carrier population to return closer to early 2020 levels.\n\nDean Croke, DAT Freight & Analytics principal analyst, told FleetOwner last week that the spot and contract markets are both declining with the excess capacity in the market to start 2023.\n\n\u201cEven though demand is relatively flat, we\u2019ve got more trucks than loads, and that\u2019s why rates will continue to go down through the first quarter,\u201d Croke said. \u201cThis quiet season will be quieter than normal because of the economic conditions we are working with and mostly because there is an excess of capacity in the market against the backdrop of cooling demand. And that just puts more downward pressure on rates. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing spot rates continue to decline longer term.\u201d\n\nSee also: Spot market returning to \u2018seasonal\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 after 2021 surge, 2022 slump\n\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nSpot-rate data, as posted on Truckstop, since 2020.

The green line is the posted rate, the blue line is the rate excluding fuel surcharges.\nVise said that demand in the contracted freight sector has allowed the industry to absorb some of the lost smaller carriers as larger carriers have sought out drivers. But he expects demand to wither in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have, at this point, essentially flattened out our current forecast, which likely will be revised downward at the end of this month,\u201d Vise said of FTR prognostications. \u201cWe're essentially just running flat\u2014just a little bit above flat for this year in the total number of truck loadings. And we\u2019ll likely be looking at a small negative number when we update our information.\u201d\n\nVise predicted that as smaller carriers fail, there will be less capacity for those drivers to find work with larger carriers.\n\nFreight factors to watch in 2023\nVise said that FTR sees fuel prices and spot rates as two leading factors that could dictate the 2023 freight market.\n\nThe smaller carriers remaining in 2023 are still grappling with diesel prices, which nationally remain about 90 cents more per gallon than last year.\n\n\n\u201cDiesel prices are probably one of the two biggest issues that most of these carriers deal with,\u201d Vise noted. \u201cWe're talking primarily one- to two-truck operations that operate primarily the spot market and live on rates. Of course, that rate minus the cost of diesel\u2014as well as all their other operating costs, such as truck payments, maintenance, insurance, and so on\u2014are a key factor.\u201d\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\nTruck loadings are flattening to start 2023, according FTR analysis, which forecasts much of the same this year.\nTruck loadings are flattening to start 2023, according FTR analysis, which forecasts much of the same this year.\n\nSee also: 'Recession' shouldn't be a scary word in 2023\n\nBased on the current crude oil prices, FTR analysis suggests that diesel prices are 40 to 50 cents higher \u201cthan we normally would see,\u201d Vise added. \u201cSo there is still some potential there, arguably, for diesel prices to come down further.\u201d\n\nSpot rates steadily declined in the first half of 2022 before somewhat leveling off in the fall. \u201cWe did have a big jump at the end of last year,\u201d Vise added. \u201cBut that is something we always see as we lose a lot of spot capacity during the holidays. So that big jump tends not to stay\u2014it certainly didn\u2019t last year. So in all likelihood, we will see a sort of flattening out here.\u201d\n\nAvailable truck utilization in 2023\nAvailable truck utilization stayed high through 2021 and into 2022 before sharp declines that put it below the 10-year average of 91% by year\u2019s end, according to FTR\u2019s Active Truck Utilization Index.\n\n\nThe index estimates how many trucks are needed to haul all the available freight and divides that by the number of active trucks available to move that freight. Vise called it a freight \u201ctightness barometer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks to ease continually for the next several months, likely bottoming out around the late third quarter this year,\u201d Vise said. \u201cThis is going to be interesting because if we do continue to see deterioration in freight, we very well could lose a lot more drivers. That would weaken the near-term utilization quite significantly. But the other side of that is that it would probably put us behind the curve as we come out with a recovery.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut if the economy is worse in 2023 than FTR anticipates, it would create a more significant upside for freight heading into 2024.\nFTR Transportation Intelligence\n","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}
{"text":"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 American consumers and nearly every industry will be affected if freight trains grind to a halt next month.\n\nOne of the biggest rail unions rejected its deal Monday, joining three others that have failed to approve contracts over concerns about demanding schedules and the lack of paid sick time. That raises the risk of a strike, which could start as soon as Dec. 9 under a deadline that was pushed back Tuesday.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t take long for the effects of a rail strike to trickle through the economy. Many businesses only have a few days\u2019 worth of raw materials and space for finished goods. Makers of food, fuel, cars and chemicals would all feel the squeeze, as would their customers.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the commuters who would be left stranded because many passenger railroads use tracks owned by the freight railroads.\n\nThe stakes are so high for the economy that Congress is expected to intervene and impose contract terms on railroad workers. The last time U.S. railroads went on strike was in 1992. That strike lasted two days before Congress intervened. An extended rail shutdown has not happened for a century, partly because a law passed in 1926 that governs rail negotiations made it much harder for workers to strike.\n\nHere are some of the expected impacts of a rail strike:\n\n$2 BILLION A DAY\nRailroads haul about 40% of the nation\u2019s freight each year. The railroads estimated that a rail strike would cost the economy $2 billion a day in a report issued earlier this fall. Another recent report put together by a chemical industry trade group projected that if a strike drags on for a month some 700,000 jobs would be lost as manufacturers who rely on railroads shut down, prices of nearly everything increase even more and the economy is potentially thrust into a recession.\n\n\nAnd although some businesses would try to shift shipments over to trucks, there aren\u2019t nearly enough of them available. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimated that 467,000 additional trucks a day would be needed to handle everything railroads deliver.\n\nCHEMICALS RUN DRY\nChemical manufacturers and refineries will be some of the first businesses affected, because railroads will stop shipping hazardous chemicals about a week before the strike deadline to ensure that no tank cars filled with dangerous liquids wind up stranded.\n\nJeff Sloan with the American Chemistry Council trade group said chemical plants could be close to shutting down by the time a rail strike actually begins because of that.\n\nThat means the chlorine that water treatment plants rely on to purify water, which they might only have about a week\u2019s supply of on hand, would become hard to get. It would be hard for manufacturers to make anything out of plastic without the chemicals that are part of the formula. Consumers will also pay more for gasoline if refineries shut down, either because they can\u2019t get the ingredients they need to make fuel or because railroads aren\u2019t available to haul away byproducts like sulfur.\n\nChemical plants also produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so the supply of carbon dioxide that beverage makers use to carbonate soda and beer would also be restricted, even though the gas typically moves via pipelines.\n\nPASSENGER PROBLEMS\nRoughly half of all commuter rail systems rely at least in part on tracks that are owned by freight railroads, and nearly all of Amtrak\u2019s long-distance trains run over the freight network.\n\nBack in September, Amtrak canceled all of its long-distance trains days ahead of the strike deadline to ensure passengers wouldn\u2019t be left stranded in remote parts of the country while still en route to their destination.\n\nAnd major commuter rail services in Chicago, Minneapolis, Maryland and Washington state all warned then that some of their operations would be suspended in the event of a rail strike.\n\nFOOD FEARS\nIt would take about a week for customers to notice shortages of things like cereal, peanut butter and beer at the grocery store, said Tom Madrecki, vice president of supply chain for the Consumer Brands Association.\n\nAbout 30% of all packaged food in the U.S. is moved by rail, he said. That percentage is much higher for denser, heavier items like cans of soup.\n\nSome products, like cereal, cooking oils and beer, have entire operations built around rail deliveries of raw ingredients like grain, barley and peanuts, along with shipments of finished products.\n\nThose companies typically keep only two to four days\u2019 worth of raw ingredients on hand because it\u2019s expensive to store them, Madrecki said, and grocers also keep a limited supply of products on hand.\n\nMadrecki said big food companies don\u2019t like to discuss the threat of a rail strike because of worries about product shortages can lead to panic buying.\n\nHUNGRY HERDS\nAny disruption in rail service could threaten the health of chickens and pigs, which depend on trains to deliver their feed, and contribute to higher meat prices.\n\n\u201cOur members rely on about 27 million bushels of corn and 11 million bushels of soybean meal every week to feed their chickens. Much of that is moved by rail,\u201d said Tom Super, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, a trade group for the industry raising chickens for meat.\n\nThe National Grain and Feed Association said a rail strike now would hit pork and chicken producers in the southern U.S. hardest, because their local supply of corn and soybeans from this year\u2019s harvest is likely exhausted and they\u2019d have to ship feed by truck, dramatically increasing costs.\n\n\u201cThey only have so much storage. They can\u2019t go without rail service for too long before they\u2019d have to shut down the feed mills and they run into problems,\u201d said Max Fisher, the NGFA\u2019s chief economist.\n\nRETAIL RISKS\nJess Dankert, the vice president for supply chain at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said retailers\u2019 inventory is largely in place for the holidays. But the industry is developing contingency plans.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see, you know, canceling Christmas and that kind of narrative,\u201d Dankert said. \u201cBut I think we will see the generalized disruption of really anything that moves by rail.\u201d\n\nDavid Garfield, a managing director with the consulting firm AlixPartners, said a rail strike could still impact holiday items shipped to stores later in December, and would definitely hamper stocking of next season\u2019s goods.\n\nRetailers are also concerned about online orders. Shippers like FedEx and UPS use rail cars that hold roughly 2,000 packages in each car.\n\nAUTOMOBILE ANGST\nDrivers are already paying record prices and often waiting months for new vehicles because of the production problems in the auto industry related to the shortage of computer chips in recent years.\n\nThat would only get worse if there is a rail strike, because roughly 75% of all new vehicles begin their journey from factories to dealerships on the railroad. Trains deliver some 2,000 carloads a day filled with vehicles.\n\nAnd automakers may have a hard time keeping their plants running during a strike because some larger parts and raw materials are transported by rail.\n\n","labels":["supplychain"]}

Those volumes were up 6% in the first quarter relative to a year ago in a period that marked one of the worst freight markets in several years.\n\nThe RXO forecast for higher volumes does not come with a specific number.\n\nThat prediction of an increase in second-quarter brokerage volumes \u201cis not something we do lightly,\u201d said Weisfeld, the sole representative of the company at the gathering. \u201cWe took a look at all the evidence, all the business momentum that we had in the second half of April and the first half of May, and we were very confident. \n\nRXO\u2019s earnings were released in early May, with April business done and May business more definitive at the time of the forecast.\n\n\u201cOur share gains are accelerating,\u201d Weisfeld said in an interview with Tom Wadewitz, the senior equity research analyst at UBS who leads the transportation group. \n\nWeisfeld said RXO, spun off as an asset-light brokerage last year from XPO (NYSE: XPO), is gaining market share. \u201cAnd importantly, they\u2019re profitable market share gains.\u201d He said gross margins in brokerage are \u201cnorth of 16%\u201d year on year.\n\nRXO previously has set a clear financial goal: Have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $500 million by the middle of 2027.

Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), which before RXO became a stand-alone 3PL was pretty much the only pure-play, publicly traded brokerage company between when Echo Global Logistics was acquired by a private equity firm in 2021 and when RXO made its debut last year.\n\nThe other company Weisfeld identified was Arrive Logistics. \u201cWhen you think about who we compete against and the dynamics of our market [large shippers], it really is just those two folks,\u201d he said. \n\nWhile Weisfeld may not have supplied new numbers, he did talk about the strategy that has led to those recent and projected gains. \n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t compete on price in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThe asset-based carriers set the price.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, the focus is on service and technology. Weisfeld described customer support as \u201cthe intersection of technology and human capital.\u201d And while 96% of loads brokered by RXO in the first quarter were covered digitally, all drivers have carrier representatives assigned to them and they are often involved in ensuring the freight gets to the final destination. \n\nWeisfeld also noted that 3PLs in general are riding a secular shift toward more shippers turning to brokerages for their freight needs. A decade ago, he said, brokers had market share in the \u201clow double digits,\u201d but he put that figure now at \u201cnorth of 20%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better solution,\u201d he said. He cited broker access to \u201cmassive capacity\u201d and \u201cthe ability to be flexible and agile and offer solutions.\u201d And it is because of those solutions, he said, that RXO has chosen not to try to compete through price, citing \u201cservice and technology\u201d as the primary RXO value proposition. \n\nWeisfeld said first-quarter contract revenue was about 77% of the company\u2019s overall revenue, which is high by historical standards. He said the range of that at RXO tends to be between 60% and 80%.\n\n\u201cWe think about how we\u2019re positioning the company for future market share gains for when the cycle inflects,\u201d Weisfeld said. (The terms \u201cinflect\u201d and \u201cinflection point\u201d was heard from multiple presenters at the UBS conference, a reference to the unknown date when the current weak freight market will turn higher.)\n\nEven as new data suggested that there is little sign of an upturn in the freight market, Weisfeld  cited various conditions \u2014 echoed at times by others at the conference \u2014 that suggested a bottom may be at hand.\n\nHe said the \u201cactive network capacity\u201d of carriers at RXO was down 3% sequentially in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022. He said the load-to-truck ratio was below two in April, extremely low by historical standards; the inflection should take that up to four\/six to one, he said.\n\nCustomers are reporting to RXO that their de-stocking of inventories is near an end or already has gotten there. \u201cSo I think all those are pretty positive forward-looking indicators as it relates to the bottoming process,\u201d Weisfeld said. \u201cWhen will that happen? It\u2019s unclear.\u201d\n\nGiven the collapse in spot rates, the question was put to Weisfeld  by Wadewitz: Why hasn\u2019t capacity pulled out of the market even faster?\n\nWeisfeld cited several reasons for the stickiness of capacity. \u201cNumber one, the good times lasted for a long time,\u201d he said. Balance sheets might be relatively strong with cash stockpiled during the strong market of 2021 and the first half of 2022. \u201cI think that likely has kept capacity in the system for longer than a typical cycle,\u201d he said.\n\nA second reason: lower fuel prices. But Weisfeld noted that the growing reports of bankruptcies and shutdowns suggest that those factors can only go so far in keeping trucks on the road.\n\nRXO should have a good window into what is going on with independent owner-operators; Weisfeld said about half the capacity hired by the 3PL comes from one-truck fleets.

{"text":"Apple Vision Pro, Cupertino\u2019s spatial computer, is expected to hit the US market in early 2024. While we previously reported that it would be tough for customers to get their hands on this product, we have also learned more about supply chain issues.\n\nPreviously, The Elec said Sony would produce 900,000 units of OLEDoS per year for Apple\u2019s spatial computer. This technology uses silicon as a substrate to make a high-resolution micro OLED display panel. Cupertino would keep Sony as an exclusive supplier until a second generation of this product.\n\n\nThat said, Apple was worried about the expansiveness of the micro OLED display as Sony couldn\u2019t keep up with production of this technology \u2013 and the Japanese company didn\u2019t want to expand its business. With that in mind, Apple could add LG Display as a possible candidate.\n\nUnfortunately, a new report by the Korean blog The Elec shows that LG decided not to invest in OLEDoS this year. Due to the company\u2019s performance, uncertain profitability, and technological difficulties, LG thought it was best to wait. In addition, supply chain sources say the volume of OLEDoS panels Apple wants isn\u2019t enough for the South Korean company to justify its investments of up to $150 million.\n\nThe publication also notes that Samsung is investing in two types of OLEDoS, one using a color filter on white and the other using RGB method that depois red, green, and blue subpixels adjacent to each other on the same layer.\n\n\nApple uses W-OLED-CF technology, and with Samsung planning to produce OLEDoS tech by 2024, the South Korean company could be a suitable candidate to diversify the Apple Vision Pro supply chain. This possibility was already raised in the past, and it might become a possibility, as it seems Apple won\u2019t have more than 1.3 million headsets available to sell by the end of 2024.\n\nWith that in mind, getting your hands on Apple Vision Pro will be trickier than it seems. Not only does Apple very much rely on Sony, but producing this product is still a challenge. Those living in the US will have difficulty getting this product in-store, and customers from outside the US might take even longer to get a glimpse of Apple\u2019s mixed reality headset.\n\nWe might discover more about this device during Apple\u2019s Wonderlust event, which will take place on September 12.\n\n","labels":["supplychain"]}
{"text":"The European Commission finally delivered its long-anticipated oral report on Ukraine\u2019s progress last month, looking at the headway made toward the seven reforms the country will need to pass if European Union leaders are to green-light opening accession negotiations with Kyiv.\n\nOn reforms relating to the judiciary, Kyiv received a broadly positive assessment, albeit more needs to be done. And the same goes for tackling vested interests in the media as well. On the prevention of money laundering, the fight against corruption, reducing the influence of oligarchs and the protection of minorities, however, Ukraine still has a lot more to do, and it will now have until the fall to demonstrate further progress before European capitals consider a fuller written assessment.\n\nWhat was crucially missing from this initial analysis, though, was the EU\u2019s own preparedness for admitting Ukraine, whether in 10, 15 or 20 years\u2019 time. This is arguably the bigger, more important consideration \u2014 especially as many in Berlin, Paris and Brussels expect the Western Balkans \u2014 as well as Moldova and possibly Georgia \u2014 to join the bloc at the same time. Leaders will therefore have to be satisfied that the EU won\u2019t collapse under its own weight if they are to move Ukraine\u2019s enlargement process forward at their December gathering in Brussels.\n\nAn initial discussion on the implications for the EU if Ukraine were to eventually join the bloc \u2014 or, what in jargon is now referred to as the EU\u2019s \u201cabsorption capacity\u201d \u2014 will thus be held by leaders in Granada in early October. And the two most important dimensions of this debate relate to governance and the EU budget.\n\nGovernance concerns the EU\u2019s ability to function, pass laws and take decisions if the number of members jumps from 27 nations to 35 or 36, given that many policy areas operate by unanimity.\n\nHungary\u2019s use of its veto \u2014 now seen by many in Brussels as an extension of its domestic and foreign policy \u2014 has focused minds in EU capitals on the risk of paralysis unless the bloc streamlines its decision-making process.\n\nFor some, the favored solution for addressing this problem is more qualified majority voting, stripping countries of their veto. Germany and France are already championing this move in foreign and tax policy. However, they face stiff opposition from Hungary, Poland and several countries that want to preserve their sovereignty by maintaining the condition of unanimity.\n\nOne possible way out of this impasse could be a compromise that sees more qualified majority voting, say in foreign affairs, but with \u201csafeguards\u201d in place. So, there would be an understanding in the Council that member countries wouldn\u2019t go against each other\u2019s core national interests. In the case of Greece, for example, Turkey-related issues would be considered a core interest. But this debate still has a very long course to run.\n\nThe question of EU budget funds is equally profound.\n\nCurrently, the largest outflows from Brussels to member countries are cohesion funds for economic convergence and agricultural subsidies under the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Together they make up roughly two-thirds of the budget.\n\nBut for now, there\u2019s still no agreement on the budgetary implications of Ukraine joining the bloc. Senior German officials who have studied the numbers suggest all EU countries that currently benefit from the budget would become net contributors to it. Other EU capitals argue the financial flows would essentially remain status quo \u2014 but that seems unlikely.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission is yet to produce its own analysis on the question.\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that the \u201cUkraine question\u201d will be the single biggest political priority of the new Commission that will take office in November next year | Dominique Faget\/AFP via Getty Images\nHowever, as Ukraine is poorer and more agrarian than the average EU member country, its membership will lead to it receiving a large amount of cohesion and agricultural funds from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nThis then raises the question of whether the EU budget will need to be increased \u2014 perhaps by more supranational taxes or via contributions from member countries \u2014 or be completely rewired.\n\nAs the budget\u2019s recent difficult midterm review \u2014 the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) \u2014 demonstrated, the bloc is already struggling to reprioritize money within its existing framework for new geopolitical priorities. And that could help create impetus for reform, as there is already an emerging consensus in Brussels that the EU budget is no longer fit for purpose.\n\nAlthough Ukraine is unlikely to join the EU before the next 10 years \u2014 and it may even take longer than that \u2014 the next MFF will still need to provision for the country\u2019s possible entry, as it will run from 2028 to 2034. This means leaders will already have to engage with these issues in the next few years.\n\nAlong these lines, the recently proposed \u20ac50 billion Ukraine facility is seen by many in Brussels as the basis for how the next MFF might address the country\u2019s accession. Rather than a toxic political debate over the winners and losers of EU budget funds, some officials are contemplating a facility that would sit alongside but be distinctive from the regular budget. Another idea is to adopt two MFF\u2019s \u2014 one for the 27 members and another for an enlarged EU, which would only be activated at the moment of accession. This is what happened in 2000, before countries in Central and Eastern Europe joined in 2004. But again, none of this will be easy to agree on.\n\nHow these reforms are implemented to make the EU \u201cUkraine-ready\u201d is also open to debate.\n\nSome in Brussels take the view that the institutional changes discussed above could be managed within the parameters of the Lisbon Treaty, while other officials say a \u201cconvention\u201d between all member countries (and Ukraine) would be necessary \u2014 like the process that gave birth to the Lisbon Treaty. Referenda may also be needed in several countries like France, although this could be legally avoided if both of France\u2019s parliamentary chambers supported the decision to admit Ukraine with a 3-to-5 majority. However, politically, it\u2019s difficult to see a referendum being avoided.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s also entirely possible that the entire enlargement process may be rethought to enable Ukraine\u2019s membership.\n\n\nRather than have Ukraine and other countries in the Western Balkans join all at once in 10, 15 or 20 years, their integration could happen in stages. Senior EU officials talk about a model whereby Ukraine would close certain chapters and then acquire the right to participate in specific Council formations \u2014 to shape but not take EU decisions \u2014 while benefiting from certain EU budget instruments and programs.\n\nThis would enable the EU to reform incrementally, helping to detoxify debate over the end date. But some countries, like Germany, oppose this approach, arguing that if member countries preserve their vetoes while candidate countries are integrated into the EU, they will never be allowed to fully join. This approach is also forbidden by the treaty.\n\nSome officials see a role here for the European Political Community, the new platform French President Emmanuel Macron created to allow the EU to engage with its wider neighborhood.\n\nWhile all this work has just begun, it\u2019s now clear that the \u201cUkraine question\u201d will be the single biggest political priority of the new Commission that will take office in November next year. And there\u2019s no doubt it will dominate politics in Brussels and other EU capitals for years to come.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"There's an expression crypto enthusiasts use, with fingers crossed, in the hopes a particular digital currency's value will blast off: \"To the moon!\"\n\nMuch of crypto did graze the stratosphere at the start of 2022, when enthusiasm was astronomically high, but a few months later it all came crashing back down to Earth.\n\nBitcoin's value is roughly a fourth of what it was a year ago, and the industry is just starting to grapple with the fallout from the catastrophic implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nIn the future, 2022 may be regarded as a turning point for the world of virtual currencies, when they lost their luster and were cast out as a fringe product most people approach with skepticism and caution. Or it may simply be remembered as a stretch of excruciating growing pains for an industry still in its infancy.\n\nRegardless, 2022 was one for the crypto history books.\n\nHow it started\nThe ads were everywhere \u2014 on TV, on bus stops, and even in fortune cookies. Crypto companies spent tens of millions of dollars on marketing, swamping the Super Bowl with commercials. The currencies and tokens may have been virtual, but crypto became more real for many Americans in the early months of the year.\n\nThe industry seemed to reach \"peak hype\" in January and February, says Molly White, a fellow at Harvard University who is a crypto skeptic. She runs the site Web3 is Going Just Great.\n\n\"Prices had hit all-time highs,\" she says. \"People were making irrational amounts of money.\"\n\nThe value of the most famous cryptocurrency \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 had just set a record, and the industry was trying to \"mainstream itself,\" as White puts it. Meaning, crypto companies were doing all they could to bring in more customers.\n\n\nA statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, a presumed pseudonym used by the inventor of bitcoin, is displayed in Graphisoft Park in 2021 in Budapest, Hungary.

But when Fallon, who is himself an NFT enthusiast, seemed blown away, they applauded.\n\n\"Peak hype,\" though, crested quickly.\n\nHow it's going\nLike just about everything else in finance, crypto saw its prices tank when the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates to fight high inflation.\n\nThat shocked many of bitcoin's biggest backers, many of whom believed the virtual currency would be an inflation hedge, like gold. They had predicted bitcoin's value would rise during a period of high inflation; instead, it was falling.\n\nWhat's called a \"crypto winter\" \u2014 a downturn that has gone on and on \u2014 began before 2022 even reached its halfway point.\n\n\"You know, we've been living in the 'crypto winter' for the better part of a year,\" says Lee Reiners, who teaches cryptocurrency law at Duke University.\n\n\nIndividual investors have been hurt, especially people who bought digital assets near the highs. But according to Reiners, the crypto winter also revealed larger, systemic problems in the industry.\n\n\"It really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity,\" he says.\n\nA string of failures started in May: a pair of cryptocurrencies called Terra and Luna, the trading platform Voyager, a crypto hedge fund called Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Celsius ...\n\nThe list goes on and on, and according to Reiners, it highlights something troublesome about crypto.\n\n\"These firms are deeply interconnected, and so, the moment you kind of have one problem somewhere in the crypto sector, it spreads very, very quickly,\" he says.\n\nFinancial regulators started to crack down, as well.

Now, it's bankrupt, more than a million people are worried the money they put into it has vanished, and the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been charged with criminal fraud.\n\n\nFTX's new CEO, John J. Ray III, testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing on the company's collapse.\nNathan Howard\/Getty Images\nBankman-Fried cultivated an image that made him memorable and seemingly accessible, with wild hair and a penchant for wearing shorts and T-shirts. His goal was to get more everyday people to buy crypto and more conventional Wall Street firms and funds to invest in it.\nThe 30-year-old was so successful at bringing crypto to the masses that he was considered the industry's unofficial spokesman. He's currently under house arrest at his parents' home in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nReiners calls the swift and total collapse of FTX \"the biggest event in crypto's history\" \u2014 a history, he adds, that's \"replete with a lot of failures and scams and frauds and hacks.\"\n\nNow, people are wondering what could be the next domino to fall.\n\nBinance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and after several big waves of panic-driven withdrawals, it looks like it has the potential to be that domino.\n\nBut the company is pushing back against fears and crypto skepticism, more generally. It has to, said White.\n\n\"If people start to question the industry as a whole, or crypto as an asset class, that is devastating for Binance,\" she says. \"So, they are doing anything they can to prevent that from happening.\"\n\nFor many, it's disorienting to see how quickly crypto's fortunes reversed, and they are struggling to gauge the depth of the damage from FTX.\n\n\"I think crypto would be lucky if all they were set back [was] by a couple of years,\" White says.\n\nTrue believers expect bitcoin will bounce back and this \"crypto winter\" will thaw eventually.\n\nBut for people who weren't deep into crypto \u2014 who maybe saw an ad or who were driven by a fear of missing out to dabble in buying tokens \u2014 it's a different story, especially with daily revelations from Bankman-Fried's former co-workers about how customer money was allegedly moved out of FTX and into their own pockets.\n\n\"I think people are starting to think of crypto as this big scam that they would not want anything to do with,\" White says.\n\nAnd that poses an existential problem for crypto, she adds.

{"text":"Kazakhstan is the largest producer and exporter of uranium globally, mining and exporting more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s supply. Up to now, it has been the major supplier for Russia and before that the Soviet Union. But today, other countries are becoming involved, including Western countries such as the United States, which wants to limit its imports of Russian-processed uranium, and China, which hopes to transition from the coal-fired production of electricity to a heavy reliance on nuclear power plants over the next decade. That, in turn, has triggered a geo-economic competition that is rapidly growing into a geopolitical one\u2014given that, at least in the short term, Kazakhstan may not be able to increase exports to one country without reducing them to another, or at least holding the latter roughly constant.\n\nTwo decisions in Astana in May 2023 have both highlighted and exacerbated the situation, though they are likely to be dismissed by some as yet another example of Astana\u2019s efforts to maintain a balance between Moscow and Beijing. In the first decision, the Kazakhstani authorities allowed a Russian firm to take control of a uranium mine. Senior officials at Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan\u2019s atomic industry agency, were opposed; and several of them publicly resigned in the wake of that decision (Kaztag.kz, May 17). They had compelling reasons to do so: Once this mine is fully operational, Kazatomprom\u2019s control of the uranium industry in Kazakhstan will be reduced from its current 50-percent dominance and will ensure that Moscow can acquire at least some of the supplies it needs. Currently, Russia uses more than twice as many tons of uranium as its domestic mines produce, 5,500 tons against 2,500 for last year (World-nuclear.org, accessed May 31, [1]; [2]). That will also have the effect of bypassing Western sanctions at a time when the US is trying to tighten them (Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty, May 16).\n\nThe second, and likely more important reason given the length of time it will take before Russia can make the mine operational, involves Astana agreeing to sell Beijing more than 30 tons of atomic power station fuel over the coming decades to allow China to shift from coal to atomic power by the mid-2030s (Kazatomprom.kz, Kapital.kz, May 31). To meet this commitment, Kazakhstan has decided to increase its production of uranium and processed uranium components by more than 50 percent, a dramatic turnaround given its statement two years ago that it was cutting production by 10 percent to maintain prices given the declining demand for nuclear power plant fuel. Given that China is even more dependent than Russia on imported uranium\u2014Beijing produces little of its own\u2014this will link those two countries more tightly together in ways at least as important as the construction of new rail routes (EADaily.com, May 26).\n\nAt present, China and Russia remain the two largest purchasers of Kazakhstani uranium. However, their competition for this increasingly scarce resource is growing, and that is further complicated by the fact that Astana is exporting processed uranium to other countries as well, albeit in smaller amounts. Among these are Uzbekistan, Turkey, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Afghanistan (Zakon.kz, May 22). All are likely to be affected by the intensified competition between Russia and China for Kazakhstan\u2019s uranium.\n\nThese latest moves highlight three important realities about Central Asia and its relationship to outside actors that are often overlooked. First, China has interests in the region that are far larger than just building transportation routes to carry goods across and from Europe. Most, but not all, discussions not surprisingly focus on this. (See, for example, EDM, April 10, May 24.) Uranium is one of them, but it is hardly the only one. China also looks to Central Asia as a key market for Chinese-produced consumer goods and as a source of various minerals and, increasingly, water (Ritmeurasia.org, November 23, 2011; Cabar.asia, July 29, 2021).\n\nSecond, Beijing\u2019s interest in these additional factors will only add to the differences it has with Moscow on how to deal with the Central Asian countries. Indeed, the Kremlin may be more worried about Chinese involvement within these countries on behalf of its interests than it is by China\u2019s promotion of rail and highway routes bypassing Russia. The former will cement these countries far more closely to Beijing than the latter, which, after all, is directed not primarily at Central Asian markets but at European ones. Consequently, while Moscow may complain loudly about all the projects that seek to route goods \u201caround Russia\u201d rather than through it, Beijing\u2019s plans with Astana\u2019s uranium supplies will matter far more in tying countries of the region to China rather than to Russia\u2014all the more so due to Moscow\u2019s rapidly declining influence within these countries (see EDM, November 15, 2022).\n\nAnd third, the focus of outsiders on the resources of the Central Asian countries is a reminder of two things that seem to be forgotten even more often than the impact of Chinese interests and actions in the countries of the region. On the one hand, the Central Asian states have significant resources that make them critical to the world at-large. Kazakhstan is a superpower in terms of raw and processed uranium\u2014not just one of \u201cthe stans\u201d as some often treat it. And on the other, what happens in Central Asia as a result of these abundant resources will have a major impact on many countries, including those far away whose elites may not be fully aware of how these lines of influence work. For them, tensions over Kazakhstan\u2019s uranium and which countries will have access to it should be a wake-up call for them to pay closer attention to a region that, in recent years, has been all too often neglected.","labels":["geopolitical_issues"]}

{"text":"SUNNYSIDE, Wash. \u2014 Jose Martinez has lived and worked in the United States since he was 14 years old. Now 67, he drives around the Yakima Valley in Washington state checking on fellow workers.\n\n\"When it's hot, do you have a place to protect yourself from the sun and heat?\" he calls out to some workers on the side of an apple orchard on a sunny June morning.\n\nMartinez worked in agriculture across the fields of California and, most recently, Washington state. Irrigation, grapes, apples, mushrooms, dairies and now cherries. He's done a little bit of everything.\n\n\"I love the fields because you're in the open air,\" he told NPR in his native Spanish, sitting on the lawn outside his home in Sunnyside, Wash. \"It's beautiful. I am proud to do it, to be a farmworker. Why not?\"\n\nWhen people think of farmworkers, often they think of migrant workers and labor organizers like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Now, they may add another name to those creating major changes in the farming workplace: Jose Martinez.\n\nOver the past decade, Martinez has been central to two flagship lawsuits creating policy changes in the state \u2014 making Washington one of the leaders in providing overtime to farmworkers and settling a civil rights case in favor of workers. And recently, he has taken his fight to Washington, D.C., where he has pushed for an expansion of legal status and protections for farmworkers.\n\nFederally, farmworkers are largely excluded from many federal workplace safety regulations. They don't have a right to overtime pay or to unionize, and children as young as 12 can legally work in the fields. As a result, some states, like Washington, have extended additional rights and regulations.\n\nPresident Biden came into office with the goal of expanding protections to farmworkers, including providing a pathway to legal status, overtime pay, sick leave and protection from heat exposure. But despite being the self-proclaimed most pro-labor president, his administration has faced roadblocks such as stalled nominations and legislation in Congress, and slow rulemaking, to make big changes a reality.\n\nMartinez's route to legal advocacy has not been easy\nThe Washington worker's journey to becoming an activist began nearly 14 years ago. That's when Martinez began working in a dairy.\n\n\"At that dairy is when I started to see workplace violations and abuses from the foremen to the workers,\" Martinez recalled. \"And that's when I began to do something about the rights that we have as workers in the fields.\"\n\nMartinez said that while working, he and his fellow farmworkers didn't get lunch or other breaks.\n\nSo he sought the help of Columbia Legal Services, a law firm in Washington that, in part, focuses on immigration issues.\n\n\"We began to fight and that overtime [for farmworkers] was born within the state of Washington,\" he said.\n\nThe lawsuit he filed argued that a failure to provide overtime pay violates state protections against discrimination.\n\n\"In that dairy, you had to eat with a taco in one hand and work,\" he recalled. \"There were chemicals, rats. You had to eat and run among the cows. They said it was an eight-hour shift, but sometimes it was 12. And we were not paid overtime.\"\n\nDue to a Jim Crow-era exemption in federal law, most farmworkers in the U.S. do not have the right to overtime pay.\n\nMartinez wins overtime for dairy workers in the state\nIn the fall of 2020, the Washington Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that dairy workers should be entitled to overtime pay.\n\n\"Wow, I felt so emotional,\" Martinez said, remembering how he reacted to the court's decision.\n\nThe Washington state legislature then created a law to provide overtime for all farmworkers, a phased-in process that has already begun. By 2024, farmers will have to pay workers overtime after 40 hours.\n\nOther states, including California, Colorado and New York, have passed their own laws in recent years requiring additional pay for people working on farms specifically.\n\nMartinez said not all workers have been happy with the deal. As an unintended consequence, farmers are hiring more workers to avoid paying overtime wages, resulting in lower wages overall for some longtime employees. While some advocates say they expected this to happen in some instances, Martinez told NPR he did not.\n\nThese farmworkers thought a new overtime law would help them. Now, they want it gone\n\"There are a few different points of view,\" he acknowledged, saying that some workers blame him for their now-smaller paychecks. \"But why don't we work the same long hours and get paid better? Why don't they pay us better?\"\n\nJose Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers after a COVID-19 outbreak at the mushroom farm where he was then employed and is now working with the group to form a union at the facility.\nMike Kane for NPR\nSome farmworkers want to get rid of the overtime law. Martinez sees it differently. He's going for bigger change \u2014 higher wages so that farmworkers don't feel they need to work 60 to 70 hours a week in harvest season to make enough to live on.\n\n\"I had faith that when I start something, I will finish it and it will be done,\" he said. \"I've never been afraid.\"\n\nA civil rights lawsuit rises out of a mushroom farm\nMartinez ultimately quit the dairy. He moved on to work for a fruit packing company, which he said had better working conditions. But the company closed to become a winery. In 2020, he began work only a few miles away at Ostrom Mushroom Farms, a mushroom producer later acquired by the Canadian company Windmill Farms.\n\nJust over a year after being at Ostrom, Martinez reached out to the United Farm Workers, an organization that he recalled from his years on farms in the San Joaquin Valley in California. He voiced concerns over poor treatment from supervisors and went public about COVID-19 outbreaks. During those conversations Martinez tipped off a lawsuit through the state attorney general's office over gender discrimination.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the mushroom farm would pay $3.4 million to about 170 workers, resolving a lawsuit \"asserting unfair, deceptive and discriminatory actions against female farmworkers and Washington-based workers.\"\n\nFerguson told NPR that while he believes this is a case of a very bad actor, it won't be his office's last case and farmworkers are among the workers in the most difficult position to advocate for themselves.\n\n\"They may not be documented, they may not speak English, there are restrictions that make it difficult,\" Ferguson explained, as to why they may not speak up.\n\nMartinez agrees that getting workers to want to talk is a challenge.\n\n\"It was really hard at first to convince the workers [to speak up],\" Martinez said. \"First thing they said is 'they'll chase me out; I have bills to pay and a family.'\"\n\nMartinez, who has legal status, says workers who are undocumented are even more afraid to voice concerns. It is estimated that over half of all farmworkers in the U.S. are undocumented and those on visas are tied to their employers for housing, transportation and documentation.\n\n\"There is sometimes a misunderstanding about the rights that we have as workers,\" Martinez said. \"But when we are working somewhere, we do have rights to a certain extent.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, he noticed workers were arriving on seasonal H-2A visas, and women were particularly being laid off.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I told them I also have a family, but I want to stop this and what they are doing is not right \u2014 they are violating your rights as a worker and we all have rights,\" Martinez explained.\n\n\nIt's hot. For farmworkers without federal heat protections, it could be life or death\nHe's now leading a unionization effort at the mushroom farm. But should a union ever be recognized, Martinez won't be part of it. His employment was terminated on April 20 for unsatisfactory performance upon evaluation and \"no improvement in the allocated time,\" according to an employment separation form obtained by NPR.\n\nJose Martinez stands in his home in Sunnyside, Wash., on June 13. His lawsuit against an area dairy farm led to the establishment of overtime rules for farmworkers in Washington state.\nMike Kane for NPR\nHanging on the wall of his living room are certificates from Ostrom for having the best attendance just months before being laid off.\n\n\"I am proud of my roots,\" Martinez said. \"And I will keep fighting to make changes to benefit future generations.\"","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

I think at some point we'll see coordination with the courts because there's going to be thousands of lawsuits.

The rivals had been reluctant to merge.\n\nA sign that the deal was driven by \u200b\u200bthe government was that the government officials took center stage in the press conference announcing the transaction. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehman were placed at the far end of the table.\n\n\u201cWith the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,\u201d the Swiss National Bank said in a statement.\n\n'Many Thousands'\nThe deal comes after three days of intense talks, which saw UBS and Credit Suisse very reluctant to tie the knot. The former felt that the bank was doing well and did not need to be saddled with a deal that could only bring problems. The latter felt that its turnaround plan would be enough to recover. But the Swiss authorities feared that the crisis of confidence suffered by Credit Suisse would intensify and, above all, that it would spread to other banks.\n\n\nKelleher said the plan by UBS includes a contraction of Credit Suisse\u2019s investment banking business. This strategy would help it mesh with the \"conservative risk culture\u201d of UBS, he said.\n\nHe said it was unknown at this point how many job cuts would be needed.\n\nThe acquisition \"supports financial stability in Switzerland and creates significant sustainable value for UBS shareholders,\u201d Kelleher said. \n\nSwiss officials worked on the deal to avoid a riskier outcome. \n\n\u201cThis is a commercial solution and not a bailout,\u201d said Karin Keller-Sutter, the Swiss finance minister. \u201cBankruptcy would have been the highest risk.\u201d\n\nSince both Credit Suisse and UBS have operations in the U.S., the Federal Reserve had worked with the Swiss National Bank, its counterpart, on the merger.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the announcements by the Swiss authorities today to support financial stability. The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient,\u201d said a statement Sunday by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nKeller-Sutter said she had discussions with Yellen and U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. Keller-Sutter said \"many thousands\u201d of Credit Suisse employees will be impacted, pointing to future layoffs.\n\n\nCredit Suisse had already planned, last October, to lay off 9,000 people. The bank had 50,000 employees through the end of 2022, with 16,000 employees in Switzerland. Its balance sheet amounted to half a trillion dollars.\n\nThe investment banking units are located in London and Singapore. In the U.S., Credit Suisse's investment banking offices are located in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.\n\nCredit Suisse has an operations division near Raleigh, N.C., with thousands of employees who work in its technology division in Poland and India.\n\nThe headcount at UBS is much higher, with 74,000 employees globally. The balance sheet of UBS is $1.1 trillion in total assets.\n\nEmergency Backstop for UBS\nOnce the deal is completed, the size of UBS\u2019 balance sheet will be larger than its competitors Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe merger between UBS and Credit Suisse is also the first major global banking operation since the 2008 financial crisis that devastated the global economy and nearly brought down the financial system.\n\n\nIt comes after a crisis of confidence in banks, sparked by the sudden collapse of California-based Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, after interest rate bets went wrong. The crisis of confidence crossed the Atlantic and hit Credit Suisse, a bank weakened by scandals, trying to turn itself around since last October.\n\nThe Swiss authorities granted a loan of almost $54 billion to the bank on Mar. 15, but this was not enough to reassure the investors, who continued to sell off Credit Suisse shares to the point where the bank's market value fell to $7.3 billion on Mar. 17.\n\nThe transaction, which is an all-share deal, is valued at 3 billion Swiss francs, equivalent of $3.24 billion. Credit Suisse shareholders will receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held, equivalent to CHF 0.76\/share.\n\nThe Swiss government has also responded favorably to a request from UBS for a financial guarantee in the event that Credit Suisse's legal problems return in the form of fines or lawsuits. It will provide a $9 billion backstop to the bank for the risks it is undertaking.\n\n\"In order to reduce any risks for UBS, the federal government is also granting UBS a guarantee in the amount of CHF 9 billion to assume potential losses arising from certain assets that UBS takes over as part of the transaction, should any future losses exceed a certain threshold,\" it said in a press release.\n\n\nThe Swiss National Bank will also provide more than $100 billion of liquidity to UBS, to help facilitate the deal.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 UBS will pay U.S. authorities $1.44 billion to settle the last lingering legal case over Wall Street\u2019s role in the housing bubble of the early 2000s, which ultimately led to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nThe Swiss bank agreed to pay a civil penalty over how it handled the sale of 40 mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007. The settlement argues that UBS bankers gave false and misleading statements about the health of the mortgages in those bonds to the buyers in violation of federal securities law.\n\nFor example, UBS bankers knew that the underlying mortgages in these bonds were poorly underwritten or violated consumer protection laws. The bonds in question ended up with substantial losses for investors.\n\nWith the UBS settlement, the last remaining outstanding legal case from the Great Recession has now come to a close, the Justice Department said. Banks paid collectively more than $36 billion in civil penalties for their conduct related to the mortgage crisis, but that does not include other settlements that banks have made to state and local authorities as well.\n\nUBS said that it already had set aside funds for the settlement, so it will not impact its financial results.\n\nSeparately Monday, Swiss media reported that two groups acting on behalf of Credit Suisse shareholders filed suit in Swiss courts to argue that the sale price to UBS \u2013 around $3.25 billion \u2013 far undervalued the bank, and that UBS was able to unjustly profit from the deal.\n\nThe Swiss government hastily arranged the takeover in March of Credit Suisse, which had been facing years of turmoil and an exodus of shareholders, by longtime rival UBS to help avert a global financial crisis.\n\n","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Geopolitics is the motivation behind most international conflicts, as countries seek to advance their strategic interests and protect their national security in a world where power and resources are limited,\u201d Ian Bremmer writes in his 2015 book, Superpower: Three Choices for America\u2019s Role in the World. Be it conflicts over fertile riverbanks, fortified highlands, natural harbors, sacred places, or natural resources, military and political leaders have long understood that control over geography embodies power.\n\nMiddle Eastern history, too, has been repeatedly marked by such struggles over strategic physical features of the natural world. Competition for the waters of the Nile River has continued since the time of Moses all the way to the modern day, with ongoing regional tensions over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Conflicts over key Middle Eastern port cities can be dated at least as far back as the Punic Wars (264-146 BCE) and remain a crucial factor in today\u2019s war in Yemen, with the fight over the port of Hodeida, overlooking the Red Sea. Sacred places have also frequently been at the heart of geography-based conflicts in the region: from the time of Abyssinian ruler Abraha of Aksum\u2019s march on Mecca, to the Crusades, all the way to the present-day Israeli-Palestinian tensions over the al-Aqsa Mosque\/Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\nPut another way, modern history in the Middle East did not significantly alter regional actors\u2019 approaches when it came to the classical physics of conflict. The occupation of Palestine, the Iraq-Iran War, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Second Gulf War, as well as the civil war in Yemen all were or are centered around territorial considerations \u2014 the loss or recovery of land. Escaping that cycle required a shift away from one of the main root causes of conflict: geography.\n\nThe more recently observed trends toward de-escalation in the region became especially perceptible in the Abraham Accords, originally signed by Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates in September 2020. Over the past four decades, Arab states had two main regional enemies: Israel and Iran. The Abraham Accords sought to de-conflict relations with Israel, while the current talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran are an attempt to reach a rapprochement with another arch rival.\n\nThe Abraham Accords, of course, were not the first instance of peace between Israel and an Arab state \u2014 both Egypt and Jordan signed peace agreements with the Israelis years before that. However, the drastic difference between those treaties and the Abraham Accords was the fact that the UAE and Bahrain do not share a border nor have any territorial disputes with Israel. The Abraham Accords, thus, involved no land swap or border security agreement; this, combined with the fact that these three states were not actually involved in a direct conflict, indicated that this was not a classical peace deal.\n\nThe difference between peace based on land and peace without land is like the difference between classical physics and quantum physics. The Abraham Accords were not governed by the dynamic variables of geopolitics but rather by a new set of considerations, which are fast becoming the dominant factors driving current regional approaches to dealing with the Middle East\u2019s chronic conflicts.\n\nThe same approach notably governed the 2021 al-Ula Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit, which reconciled the Saudis and Emiratis with the Qataris, last year\u2019s rapprochement between the UAE and Turkey, and now the ongoing normalization talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia. These examples should not be interpreted as evidence of mere tactical pragmatism based on former British Prime Minister Lord Henry John Temple Palmerstone\u2019s mantra of eternal friends and perpetual enemies; rather, they arguably signify a more profound shift akin to what Theodore Becker described, in a 1991 academic study, as \u201cquantum politics.\u201d\n\nNew principles for Middle Eastern politics\n\nThe current changes in the Middle East, characterized by a significant drive toward de-escalation and a growing willingness to periodically part ways with traditional allies, may be telling symptoms of a more profound tectonic shift. Three operating principles could explain this \u201cquantum\u201d approach to geopolitics in the region.\n\nMoving beyond geography: Geography is no longer the basis for political engagement in the Middle East. The region\u2019s established geopolitical formations, like the GCC or the Council of the Arab and African Countries of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, will continue to be important, but they will not be the only way for regional partnerships and alliances to develop. The most obvious manifestation of this direction is the adoption of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreements (CSPA) and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPA) among countries not joined by geography. The UAE, for example, has developed such partnerships with Germany, China, Russia, Japan, India, Israel, Indonesia, Austria, and Turkey, with further agreements in the works. Notably, although none of these countries share borders with the UAE, the benefits can nonetheless be huge \u2014 as in the partnerships with China and India, which involve technology transfers and food and health security. Bilateral relations not based on geographical proximity will be a major enabler for broader geography-free associations, such as the quadrilateral Israel-India-UAE-United States (I2U2) arrangement, unlocking huge potential for trans-regional cooperation.\nConnectivity and apolarity: Polarity is no longer the operating dynamism in international relations. The concept of an ideological center of gravity that brings several countries together, as was the case with Capitalism and Communism during the Cold War, is no longer the major operating assumption of alliances. Instead, the expansion of the economic cooperation model is bringing different countries with little ideological congruity together. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a notable manifestation of such a connectivity agenda, which may replace polarity as the core of the world order, providing new solutions to old problems. The electricity-for-water deal between Israel and Jordan, and the extension of the GCC electricity grid to Iraq are also examples of how connectivity can reduce geopolitical tensions. The principle of connectivity, by its very nature, dictates a letting go of polarity. In quantum politics, sides are not taken based on ideology, political affiliation, or identity blocs, be they national or religious. On the contrary, a networked world order dictates the ability of each country to develop different areas of connectivity regardless of political differences, even with rivals. The concept of West versus East will soon become an \u201canalogue\u201d system, with roots in colonialism and the Cold War struggle; in quantum politics there is no East and West. The idea of a Global South that is opposite to a Global North also runs counter to this idea of connectivity. Like networks, connectivity thrives on nodes, and the ability to freely exchange goods, money, people, and data. Polarity contravenes such possibilities.\nCooperation as security: The traditional approach to security has always been built on the idea of defense. Walls and soldiers made up the two faces of the security coin, and all national security policies are based on identifying possible foes, assessing threats, and creating measures to prevent or retaliate against them. However, the current attitude in the region is based on cooperation to reduce the possibility of a security threat instead of attempts to prevent an expected attack. This attitude is at the heart of the Iranian-Saudi as well as UAE-Turkish rapprochements, and it is at the core of the Abraham Accords as well. Moreover, interstate cooperation reduces dependencies on non-state actors and minimizes proxy wars. And while arguably such an approach to relations failed in the case of Germany and Russia, the concept has continued to work to reduce tensions between South Korea and China.  \nRegional and global implications\n\nThe above-described shift away from geopolitics will not stay regional, mainly because it is driven by global issues such as climate change, energy, food, and health security, as well as supply chain sustainability concerns.\n\nNotably, this \u201cquantum\u201d approach to politics could help reduce ossified tensions between Israel and Iran, using the bridges built by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. And looking beyond the Middle East region, this shift could even help reduce tension in the geostrategic and heavily militarized South China Sea. New connectivity projects, such as the Blue Economy ocean governance concept or underwater tunnels that will connect Iran with the UAE and Yemen with Djibouti, promise unprecedented economic cooperation capable of pacifying some of the most enduring conflicts in the region. Just like quantum physics, quantum politics is a relatively novel idea and will take much time to understand and apply properly \u2014 but the proof of concept is already at hand.\n","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"The extent of damage from a tornado that struck a critical Pfizer factory in Rocky Mount, N.C., is now coming into focus.\n\nThe first images after the tornado hit it on July 19 showed a roof that was mangled and torn off. The facility makes dozens of medicines used in hospitals across the United States.\n\nHospitals panicked.\n\n\"Every hospital buyer across the country, the second they heard about that tornado, everyone was just, like, 'Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy!'\" says Erin Fox, a pharmacy director for the University of Utah Health's hospitals.\n\nThey didn't wait to find out which products were affected or how long shortages might last.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPfizer makes dozens of hospital drugs at the damaged factory\nPharmaceutical companies are reluctant to disclose exactly what they make where. The information is often blacked out on Food and Drug Administration inspection records, for example. The agency's statement following the tornado explained \"disclosure laws prevent the FDA from providing a complete list of products made at the facility.\"\n\nPfizer declined an interview request.\n\nNPR was able to use records from the National Institutes of Health to compile a list of dozens of drugs that are made there. They cover hundreds of billing codes that comprise different formulations and packages.\n\nThe products include a lot of painkillers and anesthetics that are used in hospitals and given intravenously. And there are also drugs like naloxone, which is used to reverse opioid overdoses, and vitamin K, which is used to prevent bleeding in newborns.\n\nAccording to Pfizer, this site makes about 8% of all sterile injectables used in hospitals across the U.S.\n\nPfizer makes many of these products only at its Rocky Mount site, NPR found. However, a competing company, like Baxter International, often makes a similar product.\n\nThe FDA says fewer than 10 products made by Pfizer at its Rocky Mount factory are sole source. But the agency said there are either substitutes or enough stock in other Pfizer warehouses to minimize disruptions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBoston University health economist Rena Conti says her research shows only a handful are \"backbone\" therapies for which there are no real alternatives. \"This includes vitamin K1, which is needed for almost every live birth in a hospital,\" she says, and aminophylline, which can help people who are having trouble breathing.\n\nThe FDA is working with Pfizer to assess and mitigate the situation, commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. The agency said it doesn't anticipate any immediate significant supply disruptions.\n\nPfizer limited hoarding\nThe company was able to curtail hoarding fairly quickly, University of Utah's Fox says. Pfizer worked with wholesalers to limit what hospitals could buy to no more than 100% of their usual orders.\n\nPfizer also sent a letter to health care providers on Friday, explaining that its initial assessment of the damage found that production areas of the Rocky Mount facility were mostly unscathed. The warehouse sustained most of the damage.\n\nThe company's letter listed 65 products made at the site that Pfizer thinks might have disruptions based on existing inventory and market share.\n\nA lot of the products were already in shortage, which is good news and bad news, says Fox, who is also a national expert on drug shortages. The bad news is those shortages will continue for things like certain formulations of lidocaine, a local anesthetic. But the good news is hospitals already know how to cope.\n\n\"If there had to be this tornado, it seems like this is probably one of the best-case scenarios where, you know, manufacturing lines aren't impacted, and it was an area of the facility that can be fairly quickly rebuilt,\" Fox says. \"And so it's not a time to panic.\"\n\nShe expects the ripple effects of this to last a few months rather than a few years.\n\nClimate change puts drug factories at risk\nConti, of Boston University, says the tornado is a good reminder about the vulnerabilities in the U.S. drug supply. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the damage caused shortages of IV saline bags.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Pharmaceutical manufacturing in the United States requires access to water and has traditionally been located in places such as Puerto Rico, the Gulf states and other locations that are now vulnerable to climate change,\" Conti says.\n\nThe weather events could serve as a warning.\n\nRedundancy is also important in the drug supply chain so that when something halts production at one factory \u2014 whether it's a tornado or a bad inspection \u2014 it's not the end of the world.\n\n\"There are approximately 230 drugs in short supply currently in the United States,\" Conti says. \"The Pfizer plant will definitely take down another couple of dozen drugs, and a handful of those will likely go into shortage, or the shortages will become more persistent because of what happened. However, there are somewhere on the order of 6,000 drugs sold into the U.S. market every single day.\"\n\nShe says it's important to remember that despite all the challenges, the U.S. drug supply is resilient and \"remarkably high quality.\"\n\n\"Our system remains the gold standard for the world,\" she says.","labels":["natural_disasters"]}

It handed over control of the club in 2014 to the newly-created City Football Group (CFG), in which it retains an 81% stake. \n\nOfficially, ADUG insists it is a privately owned investment vehicle which has no links to the government of Abu Dhabi. Leaked internal documents suggest otherwise, as did the presence of Sheikh Mansour's older brother, UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, next to him in the VIP box on Saturday.\n\nFifteen years and billions of dollars on from their 2008 takeover, Sheikh Mansour and Abu Dhabi have achieved through Manchester City what they set out to do: establish the tiny emirate on the Persian Gulf as a major player in international sports.\n\nThe purpose of this has been threefold: to diversify its oil-dependent economy, bolster its geopolitical standing in a volatile region surrounded by powerful neighbors, and associate it in the global consciousness with glamor and success rather than being an autocratic monarchy presiding over well-documented human rights abuses. This phenomenon is often referred to as sportswashing.\n\nJust as with Qatar's ownership of Paris Saint-Germain, its hosting of the 2022 World Cup and its ongoing pursuit of Manchester United, and just as with Saudi Arabia's purchase of Newcastle United and effective takeover of professional golf, the ultimate purpose isn't to promote and support elite sport itself; that's just a means to an end.\n\nThose playing it, coaching it, watching it, reporting on it and celebrating it are ultimately being instrumentalized for ulterior motives, whether they like it or not.\n\nManchester City's head coach Pep Guardiola kisses the trophy after winning the Champions LeagueManchester City's head coach Pep Guardiola kisses the trophy after winning the Champions League\nPep Guardiola has won the Treble for the second time - with substantial financial backingImage: Francisco Seco\/AP Photo\/picture alliance\nAllegations of financial irregularities\nManchester City also stands accused of breaking rules in order to achieve those goals. It has been charged by the Premier League of 115 counts of financial irregularities between 2009 and 2018.\n\nIt has already been fined twice by UEFA, once for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations and a second time for obstructing an investigation \u2013 the latter after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that a number of allegations of artificially inflating sponsorship revenue from Abu Dhabi-based companies had taken place too long ago to full under its jurisdiction.\n\nOf course, none of this is the fault of Pep Guardiola, winning goalscorer Rodri, man-of-the-match John Stones, German international Ilkay G\u00fcndogan or Norwegian striking sensation Erling Haaland.\n\nThe travails of the likes of PSG, Abu Dhabi's regional rivals, and Manchester United, City's local rivals, in recent years are evidence that simply spending massive amounts of money isn't enough; it has to be spent professionally, too.\n\nNevertheless, even if City ends up being completely absolved of all accusations of financial wrongdoing, the fact remains that the recruitment, assembly and molding of a world-beating squad is a lot easier when backed by unlimited sovereign wealth, which provides the infrastructure to minimize the risk of failure and the financial cushion to mitigate it should it still occur \u2014 advantages City's rivals simply don't have.\n\nBayern fans hold banners during the Champions League quarterfinal, first leg, soccer match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich at the Etihad stadiumBayern fans hold banners during the Champions League quarterfinal, first leg, soccer match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich at the Etihad stadium\nBayern Munich fans criticized Manchester City's ownership model this seasonImage: Dave Thompson\/AP Photo\/picture alliance\nEnglish fans have no say \u2013 unlike in Germany\nMany of those City supporters who packed out one end of the Atat\u00fcrk stadium won't care; they'll feel they've deserved their moment as a reward for their loyalty over the years. And they're entitled to that.\n\nThey may also argue that, given the structural inequalities of European football, where the biggest and most successful clubs historically are continually granted the lion's share of the broadcast revenues and prize money, thus perpetuating a vicious circle and solidifying the gulf between the rich and the rest, how else could their club ever enter that exclusive group? And they'd have a point.\n\nUltimately, they may point out that they don't have a say in any of this anyway. This, at least in English football, is also the sad reality.\n\nIt was significant that, just two weeks before the Champions League final, German clubs voted against plans to secure a \u20ac2 billion investment in the Bundesliga \u2014 at least partly due to pressure exerted by supporters and members who, in adherence to the 50+1 ownership rule, retain a say in the running of their clubs.\n\nAccording to the plans, the money was supposed to have helped German clubs \u2014 such as Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig, who were all brushed aside by City on their road to Istanbul \u2014 compete in Europe.\n\nBut supporters feared that the price to pay for that would go beyond the financial \u2014 namely, 12.5% of future broadcast revenues to be paid out to a private equity investor \u2014 and actually constitute a de-facto loss of influence in their clubs, leading to potential sell-outs to investors or owners with ulterior motives.\n\nThe ultimate consequence of that was on show in the Atat\u00fcrk Stadium on Saturday night where those Manchester City supporters, whether from Cheadle or Oldham, Gorton or Newton Heath, Turkey or Australia, celebrated a triumph which they are of course free to enjoy \u2014 but which is ultimately neither sporting nor theirs.\n\nIt was geopolitical, it was financial and it belonged to the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, attending his second ever game in his blue and white scarf.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}

{"text":"Embattled US fashion company Gap has reported an 8 per cent decline in second-quarter sales to $3.55 billion as its market share continues to erode. \n\nOver the past two years, Gap\u2019s sales are down by 15.7 per cent according to figures from GlobalData MD Neil Saunders. \n\n\u201cWhile the apparel market has been challenged, this is a far worse performance than average and represents a significant erosion of market share,\u201d he said. \n\n\nComp-store sales were down 6 per cent for the quarter and online turnover fell by 11 per cent.\n\nThe company\u2019s operating income was just $106 million, resulting in an operating margin of 3 per cent. Its adjusted net income of $127 million excluded restructuring costs.\n\nDescribing the results as \u201cfar from good\u201d Saunders said new CEO Richard Dickson, who started the role this week, faces something of a mountain to climb in terms of rebuilding the business given \u201cthe dire state of the company and its various brands\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis initial sentiments, stressing the need to do things differently and to redefine the brands so that they have meaning to consumers, are very sensible. We only hope that the usual inertia of Gap doesn\u2019t grow like weeds over his ambitions.\u201d\n\nEvery Gap brand firmly in decline\nAll of Gap\u2019s brands are now firmly in decline, including the recent star performer Athleta, which saw sales dip by 2.4 per cent year on year. \n\nThe group\u2019s lead namesake brand Gap saw sales plunge 14 per cent to $755 million, however a large part of this was due to the sale of the Gap China business, the closure of Yeezy Gap and the negative impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding all that, sales were down by a net 4 per cent, the company said. \n\nOld Navy also met headwinds with net sales down by 6 per cent to to $1.96 billion, and Banana Republic fell by 11 per cent to $480 million. \n\n\u201cWhile Banana Republic maintained market share in the quarter, sales growth remains impacted in the short-term as the brand laps the outsized growth last year driven by the shift in consumer preferences,\u201d Gap said.\n\nThe company put a positive spin on its predicament with executive VP and CFO Katrina O\u2019Connell saying the group was focused on the long term, its focus on \u201cunlocking the value of our important and iconic brands coupled with the transformative actions we are taking to improve our operating structure\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Dickson, who is also president, said there were \u201cencouraging signs of progress\u201d as the company\u2019s teams streamline the way they work to enable a focus on growth-driving initiatives \u2013 \u201ca virtuous cycle that we\u2019ll look to become our norm\u201d. \n\n\u201cThis means we have to do things differently, with a clear focus on redefining our brands\u2019 meaning to consumers, focusing on creativity, designing for relevance as a pursuit rather than a goal, and leveraging our remarkable legacy to shape an exciting new future,\u201d he said.\n\nNevertheless, Gap is predicting a decline in third-quarter sales as well \u2013 \u201cin the low double-digit range compared to last year\u2019s net sales of $4.04 billion\u201d. \n\nThe company said a significant factor in Gap\u2019s recent decline was the group\u2019s sale of its China business to online group Baozun, which closed on January 31, with third-quarter FY22 sales by Gap China running to about $70 million. \n\n\u201cThe company anticipates that fiscal 2023 net sales could decrease in the mid-single digit range compared to last year\u2019s net sales of $15.6 billion. As a reminder, fiscal 2022 net sales included approximately $300 million in sales for Gap China.\u201d But adding a 53rd week into FY23\u2019s figures will boost sales by $150 million, the company said. \n\nSaunders did note that after a loss of $49 million in the same quarter last year, a $117 million profit was a positive step. \u201cBetter inventory management resulting in fewer markdowns and lower freight costs were helpful to the number. \n\n\u201cHowever, aside from this small comfort, Gap isn\u2019t in a good place. It means the new CEO will have a baptism of fire as he starts the long hard slog of trying to restore a once iconic company to its former glory.\u201d\n\nBoring, lacklustre assortments\nBy brand, Saunders said Old Navy was challenged by its core family shopper being under a significant amount of financial pressure and cutting back on spending as a result \u2013 \u201cbut to nowhere near this degree\u201d. \n\n\u201cThat means that part of Old Navy\u2019s problem is that its shoppers are defecting to buy apparel elsewhere. While some of this is the result of people seeking out lower-priced alternatives, some is also a consequence of boring ranges and styles at Old Navy. In our view, the brand has lost its edge and is churning out more of the same season after season, rather than being led by trends. This, combined with a more cautious consumer, is a losing combination.\u201d\n\nHe said selective store closures had not helped the Gap brand, where sales fell 4.1 per cent in the US market and described the product assortment as \u201clacklustre\u201d. \n\n\u201cLike Old Navy, Gap is incredibly boring and does very little to entice customers into buying its products \u2013 especially not at the high full prices it charges, hence why it so often resorts to discounting to shift stock,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe Gap brand has long been the problem child of the group, and its relevance in the market is one of the biggest issues new management will need to tackle if they want to turn around the fortunes of the company.\u201d\n\nHe had some sympathy for Banana Republic, however, noting a \u201cgenuine effort\u201d made to enhance the experience, products, and the wider proposition at Banana. \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some initial effort has not been maintained and this, along with a softer market which is less interested in smart-casual, has put an abrupt end to growth.\u201d","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"August 24, 2023 | 2:54 P.M.\nTrucking company Old Dominion Freight Line\u2019s $1.5 billion bid to buy real estate from bankrupt trucker Yellow Corp. sets the stage for the auction of one of the largest portfolios of truck terminals in key North American markets to ever go on sale.\n\nOld Dominion\u2019s offer has been endorsed by Yellow as the preferred stalking-horse bid that sets the minimum price for the properties, according to bankruptcy court and regulatory filings, and tops an earlier $1.3 billion bid from rival Estes Express Lines.\n\nYellow, based in Nashville, Tennessee, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Aug. 6 after 94 years in business because of elevated debt levels from multiple acquisitions. The company owns nearly 170 truck terminals and warehouses in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Yellow properties would be a good fit with Old Dominion\u2019s existing footprint of truck terminals, said Jeff Diener, an attorney at BakerHostetler who is representing Old Dominion in the bidding process.\n\n\u201cThey present strategic value for Old Dominion,\u201d Diener told CoStar News in an interview.\n\nOld Dominion owns 231 truck terminals in the U.S., according to its annual report. Some of its largest terminals are in the Atlanta, Dallas, Indianapolis and Memphis, Tennessee, markets. If Old Dominion ends up buying all of Yellow's owned terminals, it would potentially expand Old Dominion's portfolio by more than 70% and establish its dominance in the less-than-truckload category of companies that carry shipments from multiple customers on the same truck.\n\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line hopes to combine Yellow's truck terminals with its existing network of properties, including this terminal in Greensboro, North Carolina. (CoStar)\nOld Dominion, the second-largest less-than-truckload company, is publicly traded and has been in business for 89 years. It has been one of the top-performing trucking company stocks in 2023 with shares having climbed 44% this year to $412.65. That compares to a 31% rise in the Dow Jones U.S. Trucking Index.\n\nAttorneys for Old Dominion think its offer for Yellow's properties is likely to prevail because of the company\u2019s financial strength and since its finances are publicly accessible, said Diener.\n\n\u201cOld Dominion has a very sophisticated team that\u2019s very experienced in real estate transactions,\u201d Diener said.\n\nPending Auction\nStalking-horse bids set a minimum price for the assets that a bankrupt company is trying to sell. Other companies can still submit bids for Yellow's real estate. Potential buyers must submit bids to the bankruptcy court by Oct. 15. An auction has been scheduled for Oct. 18.\n\nTerms of Old Dominion's stalking-horse agreement to purchase some or all of Yellow's real property include a breakup fee to be paid to Old Dominion of no more than $26 million if it's not selected as the winning bidder.\n\nOld Dominion must also prove that it's a \"credit worthy entity with cash and\/or financing commitments for the entire\" bid amount, and it must pay any and all transfer taxes and real estate closing costs, according to a court document.\n\nYellow has agreed to debtor-in-possession financing of at least $142.5 million from Citadel Advisors and MFN Partners to help fund operations and bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is one of Yellow's largest creditors due to a $700 million federal loan the company received during the pandemic.\n\nSingle Portfolio\nYellow\u2019s assets may also be broken up and sold as parts rather than as a single portfolio, according to court filings. But Old Dominion believes that Yellow\u2019s real estate is more valuable as a single portfolio than if the truck terminals and warehouses were sold individually, said Elizabeth Green, an attorney at BakerHostetler who is also representing Old Dominion.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether they\u2019re more valuable together or not,\u201d she told CoStar News. \u201cIf you pick out the plum properties from Yellow\u2019s portfolio, what do you do with the rest of it?\u201d\n\nYellow\u2019s truck terminals are located near interstate highways and are zoned for industrial uses, making the real estate more valuable than other available properties. Some of its owned terminals are located in key markets such as Chicago; Nashville; Portland, Oregon; and Columbus, Ohio. Yellow also leases more than 100 terminals.\n\nOld Dominion's bid came after accessing financial details and property data about Yellow\u2019s real estate portfolio through a confidential database established by Ducera Partners, one of Yellow\u2019s bankruptcy advisers. Companies interested in bidding on Yellow's portfolio that want to access the data are required to sign nondisclosure agreements, Green said.\n\nOld Dominion\u2019s offer does not include Yellow\u2019s trucks and trailers, Green said. Those assets will be sold separately in bankruptcy court.\n\n\nYellow's truck terminal in Columbus, Ohio, is for sale as part of the bankruptcy case. Yellow owns the Roadway trucking brand in addition to its namesake trucks. (CoStar)\nOld Dominion, based in Thomasville, North Carolina, and Estes, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, have not released details of their offers. Details of Old Dominion\u2019s offer will probably be filed with the court by Sept. 1 since Yellow has endorsed Old Dominion\u2019s offer as the stalking-horse bid, Green said.\n\nMichael Roeschenthaler, an attorney for Estes, said the company has no current plans to release additional financial terms of its offer. Estes is a privately owned company that also competes in the less-than-truckload market. Estes recorded about $5.1 billion in 2022 revenue compared to Old Dominion's $6.3 billion, according to company reports.\n\n\u201cWe are currently in negotiations with the debtor and the creditors\u2019 committee and cannot provide further information at this time,\u201d Roeschenthaler told CoStar News. His firm, Whiteford, Taylor & Preston, is legal counsel to Estes.\n\nA spokesperson for Estes declined to comment to CoStar News. Yellow did not respond to a request for comment from CoStar News.\n\nFor the Record\nKirkland & Ellis is serving as Yellow's lead restructuring law firm and Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones is the company\u2019s local counsel in Delaware. Alvarez & Marsal is the company\u2019s financial adviser. Creditors appointed to the official committee of unsecured creditors include BNSF Railway, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Michelin North America Inc., Daimler Trucks and RFT Logistics, among others. The proposed counsel for the official committee of unsecured creditors includes Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff.","labels":["financial_distress"]}
{"text":"Easing supply-chain pressures haven\u2019t come fast enough to pull the maker of the popular Instant Pot cooker and Pyrex glassware out of a financial tailspin brought on by pandemic-driven turmoil. \n\nInstant Brands filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month with its balance sheet crumpled by the high costs of keeping its supply chain running even as demand for its products, standbys in many American kitchens, soared and then slumped in rapidly changing consumer markets. \n\nThe company is seeking to restructure debt that includes tens of millions of dollars owed to manufacturers in China and some $320,000 to various unnamed logistics providers, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. It lists United Parcel Service, to which it owes $802,274, and Packaging Corp. of America, at $765,167, among its top 30 unsecured creditors. \n\nThe company said in its filing that it faced \u201cunprecedented liquidity challenges, which have accelerated dramatically over the past months driven by severely tightened credit terms with suppliers, rising interest rates, continued inflation and a shifting in Instant Brands\u2019 historical distribution channels in North America, while supply chain issues persisted.\u201d\n\nThe Logistics Report\n\nTop news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.\n\nSupply-chain experts said Instant Brands\u2019 woes show how many retailers and manufacturers, particularly smaller operators without big capital cushions, are still coping with the financial overhang of the turmoil during the pandemic. International shipping costs, for instance, surged some 10-fold in 2021 from prepandemic levels and have only receded this year. \n\nRetailers have a lot of inventory that they purchased and imported at high rates and have shipping contracts negotiated during a period of high prices, \u201cso that now maybe some of the cost increases are starting to come through,\u201d said Lisa Ellram, a supply-chain management professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nThe Downers Grove, Ill.-based company\u2019s Instant Pot became a hit early in the pandemic as locked-down Americans turned to the all-in-one kitchen gadget to cook more meals at home. \n\nBut consumer demand shifted just as port closures, shipping backlogs and soaring freight costs tangled the company\u2019s supply chain. As overstuffed freight transportation channels started to crack and delays spread, lead times for ordering everything from raw materials to finished goods lengthened. Instant Brands said in its filing that it ordered parts further in advance and raised its prices to help offset those costs, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2021, a supply chain perfect storm unfolded,\u201d the company said in its bankruptcy filing. \n\nInstant Brands faced more challenges last year as retailers, overstocked with items consumers no longer wanted, slashed orders. The company cut its own production orders, raised prices and trimmed operating costs at least four times over the past three years, but still faced \u201csignificant pressure\u201d on its balance sheet, according to court filings. \n\n\nPyrex is one of Instant Brands well-known kitchen supplies. PHOTO: RICHARD B. LEVINE\/ZUMA PRESS\nMarko Bastl, director of Marquette University\u2019s Center for Supply Chain Management, said many of the companies that made goods in anticipation of strong consumer demand today are coping with higher inventory carrying costs since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates early last year. \n\n\u201cRetailers will stockpile finished product, and distributors for example and manufacturers will stockpile their input materials, and many of them are really, really hurting now that we are coming slowly out of the pandemic and demand has shifted again,\u201d Bastl said. \u201cGiven the increased interest rates and so on, their balance sheets are badly hurt.\u201d\n\nInstant Brands said in its bankruptcy court filing that it owes sourced finished goods vendors about $41.3 million, specialty material vendors about $8.4 million, and foreign vendors\u2014including its Chinese manufacturers\u2014about $45.3 million.","labels":["epidemics_and_pandemics"]}

{"text":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp contraction in both demand and supply, driven by lockdown measures adopted in many countries across the globe in response to the severity of the contagion and its geographical spread. The global nature of the crisis meant that firms engaged in international trade were exposed to international disruptions on top of domestic ones, with weaker foreign demand for exporting firms, and a reduction in supply translating into shortages of intermediate inputs for importing firms. Firms involved in global value chains (GVCs) \u2013 namely, firms that both import intermediate inputs and export goods \u2013 faced these two additional challenges to their ability to produce and therefore sell their goods (Baldwin and Tomiura 2020). In this context, the further upstream the disruption occurs, the greater is the potential for supply bottlenecks to propagate negative shocks. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a debate among academics and policymakers on whether supply value chain trade is primarily a source of vulnerability or a source of resilience (Mirodout 2020, Baldwin and Freeman 2022).\n\n\nIn our recent paper (Lebastard et al. 2023), we exploit rich customs data covering all French firms engaged in international trade to estimate the impact of supply chain linkages on exporting activity during the pandemic. 1 The monthly frequency of the data allows us to differentiate between three periods during the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis. The first phase was between February and April 2020, when lockdowns caused activity to come to an abrupt halt in a number of non-essential manufacturing and services sectors. The second phase was between May and August 2020, when exports recovered to some extent in response to the gradual lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. The third phase was from September 2020 to the end of 2021, when disruptions to global supply chains emerged and progressively intensified. We focus on all firms that had exported every month between July and December 2019. Within this sample, our treatment group comprises all exporting firms that had imported intermediate inputs at least once over the same period. We assess firms\u2019 performance during the crisis, in terms of export sales and probability of survival in the export market. The richness of the dataset allows us to then deepen our analysis and look at several sources of heterogeneity. In particular, we investigate the extent to which the pandemic had a differential impact depending on whether firms are located more upstream or downstream along the value chain and on whether they diversify the countries from which they source their inputs.\n\nFirms in global value chains: Comparing the COVID-19 crisis and the great financial crisis\nOur data show that firms involved in global production networks in the pre-crisis period experienced the sharpest fall in exports at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, and recovered at a slower pace than non-GVC exporters after the economic reopening (Figure 1, panel a). In April 2020 GVC exporters recorded export volumes that were 42% lower than the levels recorded in January 2020. For non-GVC exporters, the cumulative decline was less drastic, reaching a trough in May 2020 at 28% below the level recorded in January 2020. The two groups diverged further when the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted in the summer of 2020 and when the recovery took shape over the following year. By March 2021 nominal exports of firms not involved in global value chains had reached their January 2020 levels and by September 2021 they had recovered well beyond their pre-pandemic levels, while it took until December 2021 for GVC firms to exceed their January 2020 export levels.\n\nFigure 1 Export performance over time of GVC firms and non-GVC firms\n\na) COVID-19 crisis (total exports, January 2020 = 100)\n\nExport performance over time of global value chain firms and non-Export performance over time of global value chain firms and non global value chain firms during the COVID-19 crisis.\nExport performance over time of global value chain firms and non-Export performance over time of global value chain firms and non global value chain firms during the COVID-19 crisis.

We only include firms that exported every month in the pre-crisis period. GVC firms are included if they imported at least once during the six months before the crisis.\n\nInterestingly, during the 2008 global financial crisis the situation was reversed (Figure 1, panel b), with GVC firms recording much smaller reductions in their nominal exports than their non-GVC counterparts. Compared with August 2008, nominal exports of GVC firms had fallen by 19% in August 2009, while exports of similar non-GVC firms had fallen by a quarter at their lowest point in May 2009. In comparison with the COVID-19 crisis, the collapse in trade in 2008 was less sizeable and less abrupt, although it was more persistent for both types of firm, suggesting that whether supply value chain trade is mainly a source of vulnerability or a source of resilience ultimately depends on the nature of the crisis.\n\n\nThe pandemic had a relatively greater impact on GVC firms\u2019 exports, especially when supply disruptions intensified\nFigure 2 illustrates the estimated effect of participation in global value chains on firm-level exports. Our treatment group includes all continuous exporters that had imported at least once between July and December 2019; the control group is the remaining exporting firms in the dataset, i.e. those that did not import over that period. Our results point to the emergence in April and May 2020 of the first negative and significant effect of being part of a global value chain during the pandemic, and a new more sizeable and persistent decline in exports starting in October 2020. 2 Estimates from a difference-in-differences model show that indeed over the latter period exports by non-GVC firms benefited from the pent-up demand and accumulated savings, while those of GVC firms remained constrained owing to protracted unavailability of imported inputs. 3\n\nFigure 2 Event study, effect of the pandemic on GVC firms\u2019 exports\n\nEffect of the pandemic on value chain firms\u2019 exports.\nEffect of the pandemic on value chain firms\u2019 exports. Image: CEPR\nAdditional evidence shows that firm survival followed a similar trend to that observed for exports, pointing to a greater discontinuity of trade flows for GVC firms.\n\nFirms further downstream hit the hardest\nWe exploit the richness of the dataset to deepen our analysis and assess whether the negative impact of GVC participation on export performance differed depending on firms\u2019 position along the value chain. In particular, based on Antra\u0300s et al. (2012) we use the latest OECD Input-Output Tables to compute an index of upstreamness of production for 45 sectors. We then combine this measure of industry-level upstreamness with product-level information on firm trade flows following Chor et al. (2021), computing for each firm an average of the respective index of import and export upstreamness. We find that participation in GVCs increased firm vulnerability during the pandemic, with the negative impact of supply disruptions being greater for firms located relatively more downstream in the value chain. In particular, GVC firms in the lower half of the index distribution saw their exports decrease by about 8% compared with non-GVC exporters during the lockdown, while the remaining \u2013 more upstream \u2013 GVC firms did not have significantly worse export performances than non-GVC firms (Figure 3). Both upstream and downstream GVC firms were strongly negatively affected during the period from September 2020 to December 2021, when disruptions along value chains were at historically high levels, although downstream firms were most affected.\n\nFigure 3 Difference-in-differences, effect of being downstream or upstream\n\nEffect of being downstream or upstream. value chain\nEffect of being downstream or upstream Image: CEPR\nThe fact that downstream firms were hit harder would seem to confirm that, although negative shocks occurred in both demand and supply during the pandemic, supply shocks were indeed predominant. In this respect, the COVID-19 crisis differed from the global financial crisis, which was mainly a result of a demand shock propagating up the value chain via adjustments of firms\u2019 inventory holdings (the so-called bullwhip effect, as in Altomonte et al. 2012).\n\nMore diversified sourcing networks for core imported inputs partially shielded firms from shocks\nThe pandemic has raised the question of whether diversification would foster supply chain resilience and therefore help reduce countries\u2019 vulnerability to future external shocks. We try to shed some light on this by estimating the effect of diversification of imports among GVC firms on their export performance. We follow the approach in Lafrogne-Joussier et al. (2022), where a firm is considered as diversifying its GVC involvement whenever its \u2018core\u2019 imported products (i.e. representing at least 1% of its imports before the pandemic) are sourced from at least two countries. In our study, however, we test the effect of diversification by allowing the threshold for a product to be identified as \u2018core\u2019 to vary between 1% and 30% of total imports between July and December 2019. Our results, as shown in Figure 4 below, suggest that exports of GVC firms suffered from the lack of diversification for products representing more than 15% of total imports.\n\nFigure 4 Difference-in-differences, effect of diversification of source countries for core inputs\n\nEffect of diversification of source countries for core inputs. value chain\nEffect of diversification of source countries for core inputs. Image: CEPR\nConclusions\nIn this column we investigate the impact of supply chain linkages on exporting firms during the pandemic. Highly granular data for the universe of French exporters allow us to provide one of the first firm-level quantifications of the impact of supply bottlenecks that occurred in 2021, when disruptions along value chains were at historically high levels. We find that exporters in global value chains suffered relatively more than other exporters during the COVID-19 crisis. This was the case both in terms of export losses and in terms of the greater likelihood of discontinuity in export relations, particularly when supply disruptions were at historically high levels. This additional negative effect was mostly driven by exporters at downstream production stages, whereas diversifying sourcing networks for core imports helped to buffer the impact.\n\nAuthors\u2019 Note: This column first appeared as a Research Bulletin of the European Central Bank.

{"text":"Shares of Shopify Inc. surged Thursday after the company posted a surprise first-quarter profit and said it would reduce its headcount by 23 per cent.\n\n\nThe Ottawa-based e-commerce company\u2019s shares closed the day up 23 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the same day it reported earnings for the first quarter of the year topped analyst expectations.\n\nLayoffs smack of 'big tech arrogance': expert\nSeparately, Shopify said in corporate filings Thursday that that its workforce would shrink by roughly a quarter through layoffs and the sale of its logistics business.\n\nThe company had a headcount of 11,600 at the end of 2022; a 23 per cent reduction would result in a shedding of almost 2,700 jobs.\n\n\u201cAll geographies and all levels within the organization\u201d were impacted by the cuts, Shopify\u2019s chief financial officer Jeff Hoffmeister said in a call with analysts Thursday, but he declined to say how any of the affected jobs were part of the logistics business.\n\nGlobal News asked Shopify how many of the layoffs would affect workers in Canada, but a spokesperson did not provide a figure in their response Thursday.\n\nShopify laid off about 1,000 staff last summer, saying at that time that the company had misjudged growth in the e-commerce market during the pandemic.\n\nClick to play video: 'Hootsuite and Shopify lay off thousands of employees'\n2:01\nHootsuite and Shopify lay off thousands of employees\nShopify President Harley Finkelstein told The Canadian Press in February that there were \u201cno job cuts coming\u201d for the company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a really good place,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nDaniel Tsai, a business, law and tech lecturer at the University of Toronto, says that with another round of layoffs, morale is likely to take a hit for remaining Shopify employees.\n\nThe company going back on its word that it was done with layoffs is a sign of \u201cerratic management and \u201cold fashioned big tech arrogance,\u201d Tsai says.\n\n\u201cThey overspent and overinvested, thinking that they were making brilliant business decisions. In fact, the reality is they were just lucky,\u201d he tells Global News.\n\nTsai says that Shopify \u201cmiscalculated\u201d the trajectory of growth for e-commerce during its hot streak in the pandemic, which saw business boom while consumers were stuck at home and businesses were forced to open online shops to survive.\n\nCEO Tobi Lutke conceded in a letter announcing the first round of layoffs in July that Shopify\u2019s bet on sustained e-commerce growth during the pandemic \u201cdidn\u2019t pay off.\u201d He took the blame for the need to cut jobs at the time.\n\nMore recently, the company has underestimated the downside for its business amid an economic slowdown, Tsai argues.\n\nSpecifically, he says consumers are likely to rein in spending and avoid making more online purchases as a possible recession  looms on the horizon \u2014 and that\u2019s bad news for Shopify.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances have changed. They are proving that they misjudged the situation and they have to prove that they\u2019re adaptable and have to quickly, rapidly evolve if they want to stay in business,\u201d he says.\n\nAnalysts cheer sale of logistics business\nIn an open letter Thursday announcing the cuts, Lutke said the company \u201cis changing the shape of Shopify significantly today to pay unshared attention to our mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize the crushing impact this decision has on some of you, and did not make this decision lightly,\u201d Lutke wrote.\n\nThe chief executive said Shopify had a number of \u201cside quests\u201d that had begun to \u201csplit focus,\u201d and so the company has been \u201csubtracting everything\u201d over the past year to make sure it was as focused as possible on its primary mission.\n\nIn that vein, Lutke said the company has also decided to sell Shopify Logistics to Flexport, a supply chain management company, to help the business become more ambitious and global in nature.\n\nFlexport will also become the official logistics partner for Shopify.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, but is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approval.\n\nThe sale, a reversal of its strategy of aggressively investing in fulfillment networks, was well-received by analysts.\n\n\u201cOver the course of one earnings release, Shopify completely shifted its investor positioning to be a balanced-growth and profitable company,\u201d William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau said.\n\n\u201cThey can have the best of both worlds \u2013 a logistics business that makes them competitive with Amazon without having to manage a business that is not core to Shopify and had been losing money,\u201d said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.\n\n\u201cCombined with the reduction in force, management is showing its commitment to profitability which investors had been concerned about.\u201d\n\nWhile the headcount reductions and divestiture of the logistics business might boost Shopify\u2019s share price and investor confidence in the company\u2019s profitability, Tsai says the latest quick pivot in the business means the ups and downs might not be over yet for Shopify.\n\n\u201cI think we just have to keep an eye on this roller coaster. If things could get worse before they get better for this company,\u201d he says.\n\nShopify's next big bet\nLutke also hinted that the company will lean further into artificial intelligence in the future, calling AI a possible \u201ccopilot for entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at the dawn of the AI era and the new capabilities that are unlocked by that are unprecedented. Shopify has the privilege of being amongst the companies with the best chances of using AI to help our customers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFinkelstein talked on the earnings call Thursday about some of the customer-facing uses the company has already rolled out with artificial intelligence, including an AI shopping assistant launched in March to help consumers search the internet for the products they\u2019re interested in and buy them right in the app.\n\nHe also said AI tools to help merchants write product descriptions will allow business owners to spend less time on the minutiae of the business and more time refining their products.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are in the early innings of unlocking the true power of AI,\u201d Finkelstein said.\n\nBut Tsai says leaning into AI \u2014 a tempting step for tech companies looking to save money on human labour \u2014 can be a difficult balance to strike when it comes to customer service. Other tech giants have already replaced human reps with artificial intelligence, which he says has resulted in a more frustrating interface for many customers.\n\nShopify having real people to answer questions was a \u201cdifferentiator\u201d for them, Tsai says, and they may now lose that edge to competitors who keep a human touch for their services.\n\nThough he said Thursday marked a \u201chard day\u201d for Shopify, Finkelstein nonetheless expressed confidence in the leaner company moving forward.\n\nThe changes will leave Shopify with \u201cincredible talent density\u201d and the ability to executive on its goals at a \u201cmuch, much better speed, better pace and with better results,\u201d he told analysts Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more optimistic now than I think ever before about the future of this company,\u201d he said.","labels":["None"]}

{"text":"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corporate activism tastes different in China. Soft drink Pocari Sweat is caught in a firestorm after it pulled television ads in apparent support of Hong Kong protests. Such statements can pay off for brands that have political influence, or stand to win more friends than enemies. With Beijing involved, neither is usually the case.\n\nPocari, a sports drink owned by Otsuka Holdings, earned brownie points from protesters by ending a partnership with TVB when the channel was accused of a pro-Beijing bias - a charge the outlet denies. Little known outside Asia, the tangy drink is now a regular fixture at sweltering summer marches.\n\nBut the campaign has fallen flat. Such strategies are polarising; Pocari won fans in Hong Kong, but after a backlash from Chinese state media, the brand distanced itself from the earlier statements.\n\nCompanies globally are becoming bolder in taking principled stands. Take Nike - the shoemaker supported U.S. footballer Colin Kaepernick\u2019s fight against racism, making him the face of a marketing campaign last year. Media giants Netflix, Disney and WarnerMedia have threatened to stop working in the state of Georgia if strict abortion rules go ahead\n\n\nBut the conditions where this can work are pretty specific. In Nike\u2019s case, courting controversy was a way to charm consumers: a Reuters survey showed it sold 61% more merchandise in the ten days after it released the ads, compared with the ten days prior. In the United States, large companies with big investment budgets can actually hope to influence policy outcomes.\n\nThe maths is more difficult where China is concerned. Brands don\u2019t want to alienate the huge market, or anger a government that isn\u2019t afraid to meddle in business. Even Nike has opted to avoid any controversy. Earlier this year it abruptly abandoned plans to sell a limited-edition design in China \u2013 where it earned 14% of revenue last year - after its collaborator showed support for the Hong Kong protesters on social media.\n\nThis might also explain why Hong Kong\u2019s biggest conglomerates such as CK Hutchison and Swire Pacific have had little to say on the subject of the city\u2019s political turbulence. That could change if their earnings and share prices start to suffer. Even then, Hong Kong may end up proving the limits of companies\u2019 taste for political engagement.","labels":["labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights"]}
{"text":"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. \u2014 A mix of cost savings, faster transit times and sustainability benefits drew two major customers to use DHL\u2019s new temperature-controlled air cargo service out of Indianapolis.\n\nSpeaking Friday at Indianapolis International Airport, supply chain leaders at Siemens and Eli Lilly said the offering from DHL Global Forwarding will allow their perishable products to be transported with less packaging.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing, amazing game changer,\u201d said Chris Goss, a senior director of transportation at Siemens. \u201cSustainability is one thing, but this really does it in a whole different way.\u201d\n\nOur solutions prevent forklift accidents, reduce labor costs, improve fleet utilization, and help warehouse managers make smarter data-driven decisions.\n\nSee the AI Solution\nThe new service from DHL\u2019s freight forwarding unit is supported by a $1.5 million, temperature-controlled facility with direct ramp access at Indianapolis International Airport and a dedicated connection to Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, through MSC Air Cargo\u2019s B777F aircraft. The service has two flights per week to Li\u00e8ge, a destination providing easy access to much of Europe, said Jose Maria de Orduna, regional vice president, U.S. East Region for DHL Global Forwarding.\n\nThe service\u2019s innovative handling process is designed to safely ship pharmaceuticals and other life-sciences products without the need for more expensive and energy-intensive \u201cactive packaging\u201d such as temperature-controlled containers.\n\nInstead, DHL reduces transportation costs and transit times by using passive packaging \u2014 like thermal blankets that insulate the cargo. By having the facility located near the tarmac at the airport, DHL can quickly load containers into the temperature-controlled aircraft to keep products in their required temperature range while using less passive packaging than what perishable goods shippers often use to keep products unspoiled.\n\nA heavy amount of packaging on a product can increase weight and, consequently, costs. De Orduna recalled one DHL customer that used a large amount of passive packaging to transport products that was thrown away each week.\n\n\u201cWith a solution like this, they can reduce the amount of passive packaging, and now it\u2019s more cost-effective,\u201d de Orduna said, adding that companies\u2019 sustainability efforts also improve by using less packaging.\n\n\nPasive packaging, like thermal blankets that insulate cargo, help DHL Global Forwarding reduce transportation costs and transit times in its new service.\nMax Garland \/ Supply Chain Dive\n \nSiemens began assessing DHL Global Forwarding\u2019s Indianapolis service in February, making sure it delivered in terms of transit times and temperature control, Goss said. For example, Siemens tested DHL\u2019s capabilities by placing general cargo within a thermal wrap and pre-chilling it to mimic the characteristics of a perishable product before shipping it.\n\n","labels":["supplychain"]}

{"text":"For Jason Fellows, of Idaho, sustainability is not just a buzzword. It is a way of life for the farmer with a deep-rooted connection to the land that shapes the legacy he envisions for generations to come.\n\n\u201cSustainability is the key thing that helps people through the future,\u201d Jason said. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t focused on sustainability, we wouldn\u2019t have things that are there for our kids or their kids.\u201d\n\nJason and his brother have been stewards of their piece of Idaho for years, and their commitment to sustainability led them to embark on a unique project, Beaver Dam Analogs (BDAs).\n\n\u201cA BDA is a Beaver Dam Analog,\u201d Jason explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a man-made beaver dam designed to mimic the function of a natural beaver dam. The purpose of a BDA is to slow down water in a creek, allowing the water to seep into the soil and improve the land\u2019s hydrology.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, the Fellows noticed a decline in stream flow on their property. It was a concerning trend that led them to reminisce about days past when beavers inhabited the creek, and their presence had a positive impact on water retention.\n\nThe brothers decided to install BDAs in their creek to address the issue, aiming to replicate the beaver\u2019s natural water management.\n\n\u201cOur goal in doing the Beaver Dam Analog projects was to make our place more sustainable,\u201d Jason said.\n\nThis innovative approach to water management proved to be prophetic during a year with a high snowpack and intense runoff. The BDAs, filled with sediment, showcased their effectiveness in preventing soil erosion and maintaining creek stability. In contrast, other creeks in the area without BDAs experienced significant erosion and deepened channels.\n\nBDAs conserve water as well as foster biodiversity. Riparian areas along riverbanks where water dissipates are critical for wildlife. Beaver presence in these areas\u2014or the implementation of BDAs\u2014significantly reduces the risk of wildfires, as they remain moist and act as natural firebreaks.\n\nHowever, while implementing this man-made fix was vital, Fellows also recognized the larger goal of the project as a way to attract beavers back to the area.\n\n\u201cThe big thing about a BDA is you want to attract a beaver back in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have a pool of water where a beaver feels safe, the beaver won\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nFor Fellows and his fellow farmers and ranchers, sustainability is not an abstract concept. It is a daily practice rooted in the land and its future.\n\n\u201cAs farmers and ranchers, we focus on providing for future generations and taking care of the land,\u201d Fellows said.","labels":["None"]}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 Amazon's new end-to-end suite of supply chain services has plenty of growth ahead of it, executives said at the company's annual third-party seller conference Wednesday.\n\nSupply Chain by Amazon, which handles logistics from manufacturing facilities to customer delivery, launched this week for sellers to use across all their sales channels. Company leaders detailed its current limitations and long-term expansion plans during multiple sessions at Amazon Accelerate.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the conference about Supply Chain by Amazon, what it offers now and what it could offer in the near future.\n\nAccess now \u2794\n\nTrendline\n\nProcurement strategies in today's supply chain\n\nCan relationships between buyers and suppliers evolve fast enough to keep up with the speed of ever-changing supply chain risks?\n\nAccess now \u2794\n\nTrendline\n\nProcurement strategies in today's supply chain\n\nCan relationships between buyers and suppliers evolve fast enough to keep up with the speed of ever-changing supply chain risks?\n\nThere are some limitations \u2014 for now\n\nAlthough some services within Supply Chain by Amazon can be used beyond the U.S., Supply Chain by Amazon in its entirety is U.S. only, said Dhananjay Ramaswamy, director of product management for global shipping at Amazon.\n\n\u201cWe are working on building the network and perfecting it, but we will of course be looking at other destinations in the near future,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\nCertain product categories are not yet supported by Supply Chain by Amazon, including perishables, items that contain potentially dangerous substances or materials and bulky, \u201cnon-sortable\u201d goods that can't be stored in boxes, said David Barashi , an executive for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution, its long-term storage service that's part of Supply Chain by Amazon. Those products can still be placed directly into Fulfillment by Amazon, the company's fulfillment offering for sellers, however.\n\nAmazon is working to make more of these products eligible for its end-to-end offering.\n\nAmazon is touting its ocean shipping reliability\n\nAmazon Global Logistics, part of the company's end-to-end supply chain offering, handles cross-border transportation for sellers.\n\nYear-to-date, 84% of Amazon Global Shipping's shipments have arrived at or before the promised arrival date at the time of booking, according to Hernan Zini, director of logistics services at Amazon Global Logistics.\n\n\u201cWe can partner with carriers that have a very good reliability and very good speed on ocean freight,\u201d Zini said.\n\nThis gives sellers an added incentive to use Supply Chain by Amazon, rather than leaning on a separate company to bring products into the Amazon's fulfillment network, Ramaswamy said.\n\nAccess now \u2794\n\nTrendline\n\nNavigating supply chain peak season in 2022\n\nNavigating and managing peak season each year comes with unique challenges.

Why would you want to walk away from the ability to integrate the entire supply chain and get the benefit all the way from the origin end to end?\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\nMore origin points beyond China will be added\n\nAmazon Global Logistics currently allows sellers to ship cargo from mainland China and Hong Kong to Amazon facilities in the U.S., UK and EU.\n\n\u201cThere was a reason for that,\u201d Zini said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we get it right before we start scaling and spreading our products across the globe.\u201d\n\nNext year, sellers can expect an announcement from Amazon on new countries of origin to ship cargo from, Zini said. Vietnam has been a frequent request and will likely be an addition for Amazon Global Logistics in the near future, he added.\n\nAmazon is encouraging shipments into East Coast ports\n\nAmazon Global Logistics is offering sellers lower prices to ship their products from China to the U.S. East Coast, rather than to the West Coast, Zini said. While ocean freight transit times typically take 7 to 10 days longer to get to New York instead of Los Angeles, it's worth it to quickly meet East Coast consumer demand, he added.\n\n\u201cOnce the container arrives there, we can move it very fast into the fulfillment centers on the East Coast so you are regionally, or locally, in stock,\u201d Zini said.\n\nZini also highlighted risks regarding congestion at West Coast ports, which was a frequent problem when imports surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think it's particularly important to diversify, and having goods coming into both sides of the country could be a good way for you to manage any risk,\u201d he said.\n\nKeep up with the story.

This is because while Fulfillment by Amazon focuses on getting orders to customers quickly, Amazon Warehousing and Distribution provides long-term storage for bulk inventory.\n\nThe service, now open to all sellers, won't have increased storage fees during peak season. This will allow sellers to store plenty of inventory at a reduced cost as they prepare for the holiday ordering rush, Ramaswamy said.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is piloting whether sellers can reserve storage space guaranteeing them access to long-term capacity months in advance, said Barashi, the Amazon Warehousing and Distribution executive.\n\n\u201cWe continue to invest in [Amazon Warehousing and Distribution], and we are planning to add significantly more capacity in the next 12 months to make sure we meet all your needs,\u201d Barashi said.\n\nid:215637_6410\n\nWorkers pack and ship customer orders at an Amazon fulfillment center on Aug. 1, 2017 in Romeoville, Illinois.

{"text":"(HOLLISTER, Calif.) \u2014 Striking Amazon delivery drivers and dispatchers from Palmdale, Calif., extended their picket line to a delivery station (DJC5) in Hollister, Calif. today, to demand the e-commerce giant stop its unfair labor practices. The growing strike will continue until Amazon reinstates the unlawfully terminated Palmdale employees, recognizes the Teamsters, respects the contract negotiated by the workers, and bargains with the Teamsters Union to address low pay and dangerous working conditions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that we are making deliveries in 100-degree temperatures without enough water or working air conditioning,\u201d said Heath Lopez, a striking Amazon driver who traveled to Hollister for the picket line. \u201cWe are on strike to stop Amazon\u2019s unfair labor practices. It\u2019s time for Amazon to take responsibility for our safety.\u201d\n\nAmazon drivers and dispatchers began their unfair labor practice strike at Amazon\u2019s DAX8 delivery station in Palmdale, Calif., on June 24. They have picketed a dozen Amazon warehouses around the country, including facilities in California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Georgia.\n\n\u201cSince this strike started on June 24, these Amazon workers have remained united in pursuit of fair pay and safe jobs,\u201d said Victor Mineros, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 396 in Los Angeles. \u201cDespite Amazon\u2019s illegal refusal to recognize their union or engage in bargaining, the community and fellow workers in this industry have consistently shown unwavering support. Millions of Teamster members stand shoulder to shoulder, with firm resolve, supporting their brothers and sisters at Amazon. Together, we are resolute in holding this corporate criminal accountable for its treatment of their workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand in solidarity with the Amazon Teamsters from Palmdale in their fight against Amazon\u2019s abuses,\u201d said Jason Rabinowitz, President of Teamsters Joint Council 7. \u201cTeamsters at UPS recently won a historic contract by organizing and demanding what they deserve. It is great to see Amazon workers fighting for what they need too and every Teamster supports them.\u201d\n\nThe 84 workers in Palmdale joined Teamsters Local 396 and bargained a contract with Amazon\u2019s Delivery Service Partner (DSP), Battle-Tested Strategies (BTS), in April. Despite the absolute control it wields over BTS and workers\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, Amazon has refused to recognize and honor the union contract. Instead, Amazon has engaged in dozens of unfair labor practices in violation of federal labor law, including terminating the entire unit of newly-organized workers.\n\nAmazon drivers in Palmdale organized with the Teamsters to protect their safety in extreme temperatures, which regularly exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit during Palmdale summers. Their Teamster contract guarantees the rights of workers to drive safe equipment and refuse unsafe deliveries. Making the contract\u2019s protections a reality will require an overhaul of Amazon\u2019s exploitative labor practices.\n\nFounded in 1903, the Teamsters Union represents 1.2 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.
