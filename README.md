## Problem

We receive many news articles every day and want to tag them with pre-defined classes.
There are 8 classes:
- geopolitical_issues
- epidemics_and_pandemics
- natural_disasters
- financial_distress
- financial_success
- investments
- labor_workforce_compliance_human_rights
- supplychain

They can also be found in `data/classes.txt`.

Using labeled data in `data/craft-ml-data.jsonl`, create a solution that assigns zero or more relevant classes to each article.
It's up to you how you design it, how you utilize the data and what tools you use on the way. We want to see how you approach the problem given the freedom to build the best solution possible.

During the interview we will ask you:
 - Why did you decide to implement it this way?
 - What were the alternative approaches and why didn't you choose them?
 - What were the difficult things about this challenge?
 - If you had more time - what would you do differently/what would you add?

This challenge shouldn't take you more than 3-4 hours to complete. If you find yourself running out of time - please document what would you do next.
